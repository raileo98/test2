<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Sports, Culture and Tourism emphasised that she will stay principled and innovative in her work, as she wrapped up her three-day trip to Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Marking her first visit to Beijing since becoming the tourism chief four months ago, Rosanna Law revealed that Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, has offered his encouragement to her staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The director was particularly focused on how we can be innovative in the aspect of tourism, particularly our islands and coasts, we can make good use of such valuable, rich tourism resources," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, we have been working on that in the short, medium, and even the long-term."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that the Development Bureau is inviting expressions of interest for coastal and island tourism projects on Lamma Island and Lantau Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing the trip as "very fruitful," the minister said she has reported to Xia and the General Administration of Sport of China on a series of mega events staged at the Kai Tak Sports Park after its opening in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  These included the Hong Kong Sevens, for which Law said the feedback from revellers coming outside the SAR and athletes was generally positive.
  <br>
  <br>
  She emphasised that the government has to continue to fulfill its role in leading and monitoring the Kai Tak venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, meanwhile, noted that the current situation for Hong Kong's film industry is challenging.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the overall economic situation might have caused some cinemas to shut down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourism chief added the industry should grab hold of the opportunities on the mainland offered by the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, or CEPA.

<div class="itemFullText">
 People on Friday flocked to cemeteries to pay their respects to their ancestors as part of tradition for the Ching Ming Festival.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a cemetery in Diamond Hill, police have controlled traffic flow on certain roads to maintain order.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman said the crowd was smaller than expected, and the weather was suitable for tomb sweeping.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not many people here. I normally come in the morning. There's wind and it's not too sunny," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  People also bought paper offerings to cemeteries, but one man said they cost more than last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These cost me HK$400. It's ten percent more than last year. But this is the tradition. We use these to pay respects to our ancestors. It's not about the money. It's about our intention," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A shopkeeper said business was better than expected, and there had been people buying paper offerings at his shop since a month ago.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said five local men were arrested in relation to child pornography, as officers warned about AI-generated pornographic images.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said five local men, aged between 16 and 49, were arrested last week on suspicion of producing and possessing child pornography, and obstructing a police officer in the execution of his duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said hundreds of videos and photos related to child pornography were found in the suspects' electronic devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said pornographic images were found in a 16-year-old suspect's mobile phone, in which he was believed to have filmed his 11-year-old sister.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police clinical psychologist, Fung Ho-kin, said that police, schools and parents need to work together more to prevent this from happening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should, and they do, provide education to students as in what behaviour is acceptable on the internet and what is not," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they are doing workshops in some schools to teach their students how they should respond or how they should behave when they are faced with threats, including internet bullying or sexual exploitation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said there were 80 cases in Hong Kong related to child pornography last year, and about 80 percent of the cases were in relation to online activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said in a joint operation with authorities in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, a total of 435 people were arrested over the past two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said some cases in other countries were found to involve AI-generated pornographic images, and officers warned that producing content involving child pornography electronically is also a crime.

    HK manufacturers to wait-and-see amid Trump tariff
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798915_1_20250404113116.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has voiced its strong opposition towards US President Donald Trump's latest round of levies.
 <br>
  <br>
  They were part of sweeping tariffs by the Republican leader directed at countries around the world on Thursday, including 34 percent tariff on goods from China. That's on top of the existing tax of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Friday, association chairman Wingco Lo pointed out that the move has affected the stability of global supply chains, and has damaged the international trade order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of variables and uncertainties, so manufacturers do not dare to move when it comes to planning, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will wait and see what the US is going to do. Because its policies often keep changing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo noted that US firms and importers are also adopting a wait-and-see approach, and they might suspend placing an order, or doing it later than usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the short-run, there might be a shock effect on trade activities, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  World leaders and businesses have expressed shock and concern by Trump's tariff barrage, with many markets taking a similar stance of not making any major moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lo believes the imposition of tariffs are Trump's bargaining chip and will not last long.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because Washington itself will also suffer from the move, especially its importers, ports, as well as retailers, according to Lo, and the measure would step up inflation and reduce consumer purchasing power.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong manufacturers are encouraged to open up new markets, and set up production lines in places with low, or even no tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, told the same programme that while he anticipates the SAR's trade industry to suffer losses due to the levies, he expects the impact to be temporary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The situation will get better when people adapt to the reciprocal tariffs, he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has expressed strong disapproval and discontent over the United States for imposing a fresh round of tariffs and cancelling a duty-free exemption on small parcels.
 <br>
  <br>
  It called on Washington to withdraw the “bullying” measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump earlier announced a raft of punishing tariffs targeting countries around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also signed an executive order to cancel a trade exemption known as "de minimis", which allows low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the country free of duties, from May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US's measures are bullying and unreasonable, and grossly inconsistent with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, willfully undermining the multilateral trading system which is the cornerstone for international trade," a Hong Kong government spokesperson said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once again, the government firmly requests the US to withdraw its so-called reciprocal tariff measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to changes to the "de minimis" exemption, the administration said Hongkong Post will temporarily maintain postal services to the US without collecting any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US until May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US has been repeatedly changing its policies unilaterally. Hongkong Post has requested the postal administration of the US to promptly clarify the matter and should not cause inconvenience to the public," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also pledged to closely monitor and assess any unilateral measures of the US that are inconsistent with fair trade, saying it will defend the city's legitimate interests by, for example, filing a complaint to the WTO.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Any sanctions imposed on public officers are "insults" to the rule of law, the head of Hong Kong's Law Society said on Thursday, days after the United States took action against six officials.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its president, Roden Tong, also said in Beijing that the society would not make comments from "a political perspective", but stressed that public servants should not be interfered with when discharging their duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any sanctions targeting public officials, lawyers or even businessmen for exercising their due functions and rights in accordance with the law are an insult to the rule of law," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong led a delegation from the society on a four-day visit to the capital, during which the group held a number of exchanges with mainland officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the meetings was with a deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Nong Rong, he said, adding that they discussed a number of law-related topics.

 A boxing coach charged with murdering a man in Fo Tan last month appeared in Shatin Court on Thursday, after he was arrested in Thailand and sent back to Hong Kong this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Truong Quoc Anh, 25, faces a preliminary charge of murder following the death of the 52-year-old man in an attack in Lai Wo Lane on March 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sha Tin magistrate David Chum adjourned the case until May 29 at the prosecution's request.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendant was remanded in custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police earlier said the defendant was one of nine suspects identified as being connected with the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  All but one of them had been arrested or charged by local or mainland authorities.

 A transport worker was on Thursday convicted of rioting in the Yuen Long clashes in 2019 following a retrial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wong Chi-wing, 58, was acquitted in 2021 but the Department of Justice later successfully sought an appeal, sending the case back to the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong faced a count each of rioting and wounding with intent, as part of a group of white-shirted men inside the Yuen Long MTR station on July 21, 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  District Court judge Eddie Yip also found him guilty of wounding with intent, saying Wong could be seen in video footage carrying out what the judge described as "an indiscriminate attack" on people at the station.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said he had compared the face of the man shown in the footage with pictures of Wong following his arrest, as well as clothes that officers had seized.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip said the trousers and shoes were extremely similar to what the suspect was wearing at the scene, saying the shoes were unique.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that CCTV footage had caught the defendant wearing those trousers and shoes going in and out of his residential building.
  <br>
  <br>
  In mitigation, Wong's lawyer, senior counsel Lawrence Lok, sought a lenient sentence, saying his client wasn't highly involved in the attack, that his wife had passed away and he's now on medication to treat anxiety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sentencing is due to take place on Tuesday.

    'Don't go with top-bidder rule for N Metropolis'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A DAB lawmaker on Thursday suggested the government take into account the financial stability of developers when it comes to decisions on tender awards for Northern Metropolis projects to the highest bidders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suggestion comes after a Development Bureau announcement this week that 22 Hong Kong and mainland companies had submitted expression of interests in developing three pilot zones in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The zones are located in Hung Shui Kiu, Fanling North and the San Tin Technopole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tenders are set to begin in the second half of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau Kwok-fan cautioned against the highest-bidder-wins principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The bidders' financial strength is also crucial," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the government simply allows the highest bidder to win the tender, it's true that a company might be able to offer a high bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if the company doesn't have much assets, the company's size isn't big, it doesn't have experience building largest-scale infrastructure, or it has a high debt ratio, are we really confident that we can hand them such a large area, or confident that the firm can complete the project by the deadline?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the government can adopt a two-envelope approach – which takes into account the bidders' technical competence as well as their financial ability – and awards the tenders to those bidders that have the highest overall scores.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said given that land in the Northern Metropolis will be developed for various purposes, such as residential and industry, the government should set up a working group to help developers obtain approvals from different bureaus and departments more quickly.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A series of traffic accidents disrupted early morning commutes on Thursday, with collisions occurring in quick succession along Lung Cheung Road and Ching Cheung Road.
 <br>
  <br>
  At about 7:30am, a major collision involving seven private cars occurred on Lung Cheung Road’s Kwun Tong-bound lanes near Lung Cheung Road Park. The crash left six people injured – five men and one woman – all of whom were brought to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage showed the rear of a car pointing upwards as it lay on top of another car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just nine minutes later, a coach and a private car collided on the same road’s Kwun Tong-bound section near Wong Tai Sin Temple. No injuries were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  And two minutes later, a three-vehicle accident occurred on Ching Cheung Road near Caritas Medical Centre. The collision involved two taxis and a private car, with one taxi passenger – who suffered chest and back pain – taken to Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said some of the Kwun Tong-bound lanes of Lung Cheung Road near Lung Cheung Road Park are closed, and that traffic is congested.

    Tariffs target packages under US$800 from HK

<img alt="US President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order on tariffs, in the Rose Garden at the White House. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798734_1_20250403084633.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that closes a trade exemption known as "de minimis" that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the United States, free of duties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed the order, which takes effect on May 2, in the Rose Garden of the White House after announcing sweeping new tariffs on global trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the move came after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick certified "adequate systems are in place to collect tariff revenue" on the shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said imported goods from mainland China and Hong Kong sent outside the international postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to all applicable duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imported goods sent through the postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to a duty rate of either 30 percent of their value or US$25 per item, with that rate increasing to US$50 per item after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had signed an initial order on February 1 ending duty-free entry for the cheap Chinese goods, but later paused the order because of logistical issues complicating the inspection of millions of the low-value shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of all packages coming into the US now enter via de minimis, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order affecting de minimis parcels was paused on February 7 because there had not been sufficient time to prepare, with packages stacking up at ports of entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said carriers transporting the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong postal items must "report shipment details to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), maintain an international carrier bond to ensure duty payment, and remit duties to CBP on a set schedule."
  <br>
  <br>
  It said CBP may require formal entry for any postal package instead of the specified duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the commerce secretary would submit a report within 90 days assessing the order’s impact and considering whether to extend these rules to packages from Macau. (Reuters)

    Govt seeks interest in ecotourism projects

<img alt="The government wants to develop Pak Nai into an ecotourism destination. Photo: Development Bureau" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798669_1_20250402192137.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau announced on Wednesday that it is inviting expressions of interest for three major ecotourism projects in outlying islands and coastal areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time in recent years that the government has released large areas of land to build new attractions for tourism and recreation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The projects are: transforming the Ex-Lamma Quarry site into a high-end lakeside resort; developing a new Eco-Recreation Corridor in South Lantau; and creating ecotourism nodes at Tsim Bei Tsui and Pak Nai.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokesperson said officials are seeking market input before starting statutory planning procedures, to ensure the projects better align with market interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ex-Lamma Quarry project envisions a luxury resort complex featuring a 5-hectare artificial lake, a marina that can accommodate 150 to 200 yachts, as well as low-density housing development.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure coordinated planning, officials aim to have a single developer manage the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 9.3-hectare South Lantau Eco-Recreation Corridor – spanning Cheung Sha, Pui O, Shui Hau and Shek Pik – will feature adventure resorts and ecotourism facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developers may choose to develop the entire corridor or focus on individual facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tsim Bei Tsui and Pak Nai nodes, covering 87 and 33 hectares respectively, will become tourist spots featuring restaurants, wellness centres and holiday resorts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Multiple developers can participate in this project, and local villagers will have the opportunity to become business partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau will hold briefing sessions for each project on April 14, and interested parties have until July 2 to submit their expressions of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the three projects are expected to cost tens of billions of dollars each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to open the Ex-Lamma Quarry project for bidding in the second half of 2026, and expects it will take around six to seven years to complete.

<img alt="CK Hutchison has announced plans to sell its ports, including assets along the Panama Canal. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798683_1_20250402211035.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) on Wednesday reposted an article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper voicing opposition to CK Hutchison's plans to sell dozens of ports, including strategic assets along the Panama Canal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The article said CK Hutchison is an important Hong Kong-based firm, and it should bear its basic responsibilities and fix its mistakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece included views from various political and business leaders, including vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former chief executive CY Leung who said national interests are most important.
  <br>
  <br>
  He questioned if the US government would give the green light if China wants to buy US chip enterprises and the firms are willing to sell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing officials in charge of SAR affairs have reposted a number of commentaries at the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, criticising the proposed sale to a US consortium led by investment firm BlackRock.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Wednesday more suspects have been arrested in connection with the murder of a 52-year-old man in Fo Tan last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the suspects is a 25-year-old man who was taken into custody in Thailand earlier and has since returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said he was arrested near Pattaya and sent back to the SAR on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police believe he was one of two people who carried out the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday afternoon, the suspect was taken to Fo Tan where officers reconstructed the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said he will be charged soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also revealed that two others were arrested earlier on suspicion of assisting offenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, eight out of the nine suspects linked to the case have been arrested by Hong Kong or mainland police, including a 76-year-old man and his son who allegedly planned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a media briefing, superintendent Li Muk-yik said the remaining suspect, who allegedly served as a lookout, had fled to the mainland and remains at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the force was able to identify all the suspects after going through surveillance cameras.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that the probe has been challenging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The suspects [allegedly] put fake licence plates on taxis [as they fled]. They were very cautious before and after the incident," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had [allegedly] changed their clothes and the vehicles several times after they fled."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said the case was triggered by disputes over money.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescue teams from the SAR and the mainland have joined hands in finding a survivor in the quake-rattled Myanmar city of Mandalay.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 52-year-old man had been trapped in the rubble of a hotel for more than 120 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint rescue came five days after the earthquake, beyond what is typically considered the critical "golden" period for finding survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was found in stable condition and has been transferred to local medical facilities for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the ninth survivor rescued by the national team since their deployment to Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, security minister Chris Tang expressed gratitude to members of both the national and SAR squads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, who led the 51-strong SAR team, said they spared no effort in the search and rescue work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The team will grasp every opportunity, never give up and do its best to find the remaining survivors," he said.

 The psychological well-being of Hong Kong's secondary school pupils improved slightly in the last academic year but was still worse than before the pandemic, the Department of Health said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 430,000 children in primary and secondary education received student health services in the 2023/24 school year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data from the department's annual report shows 2.8 percent of secondary pupils reported having had plans to take their own lives, while 1.3 percent said they had actually attempted suicide.
  <br>
  <br>
  This figures were up from the 2.5 percent and 1.1 percent recorded in 2018/19.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is self-reported, so it may not represent the whole story. Some students may not wish to tell in the questionnaire... It may be underestimated or overestimated," said community medicine consultant Chuang Shuk-kwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they say yes to the attempted suicide or planned suicide, we are very concerned and we will provide them individual counselling, and if necessary, we will refer them to the specialist or even A&E departments, if there is indeed an emergency."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Chuang also said that over 40 percent of primary school students and 80 percent of secondary school students spent two or more hours per day using electronic screens for recreational purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the increased screen time among students may worsen their vision.

    Roles of RTHK, information unit don't overlap: govt

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce chief Algernon Yau on Wednesday stressed that merging the city's public broadcaster and the government's public relations office might not be the most effective way to cut expenditure, saying the two bodies do not overlap in their functions.
 <br>
  <br>
  In response to questions from lawmaker Junius Ho on the feasibility of combining RTHK and the Information Services Department (ISD), the secretary for commerce and economic development said a merger might be "counterproductive" when it comes to the administration's overall public relations work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Merging the two departments with distinct functions may not be the most effective way to increase revenue and reduce expenditure in terms of overall operations," he told the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public may confuse the role of RTHK, as a public service broadcaster, with that of the ISD, as the government promoter. This may be counterproductive to the government's overall public relations works, which is not advisable."
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip said the two departments should increase the use of artificial intelligence to reduce manpower, suggesting there could be redundancy given her past interviews with the public broadcaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said in response that RTHK has been using artificial intelligence to produce its programmes to cut spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another lawmaker, Carmen Kan, urged RTHK to better promote the administration's policies, to which the commerce minister said the public broadcaster is introducing a brand new show on top of existing current affairs programmes.

    New police chief will lead force well: Regina Ip

<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Wednesday said she believes new police commissioner Joe Chow will lead the force effectively.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ip, who's also the New People's Party chairwoman, congratulated Chow on his appointment.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she is not too familiar with him, but has observed his performance in the Executive Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because of his rich experience in policing, along with his good cooperation with Raymond Siu, who has just stepped down from his post, I am very confident that he will definitely lead the force effectively by upholding the spirit of honour, duty and loyalty," Ip said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the United States hitting another six SAR and mainland officials with sanctions this week, Ip said Chow would be dedicated to his duties and unaffected by such intimidation if he were also to be sanctioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, former security minister Lai Tung-kwok, who's now a New People's Party lawmaker, pointed out that Chow is a "very suitable candidate" for the position.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief joined the force in 1995 and rose through the ranks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai told RTHK that all through the force's history the post of commissioner has always been filled from within its ranks "for very obvious reasons".
  <br>
  <br>
  The police, he said, "needs an experienced and capable officer to lead the force, and they have a very well-established succession plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given Joe's long outstanding service within the force, I think he is a very suitable candidate."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of Chow's key targets is to promote smart policing, which Lai said is crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because smart policing is the only viable solution for the force to deliver the best performance with limited, or even reduced, allocations of resources available within the government, he added.

    National security among new police chief's priorities

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed Commissioner of Police Joe Chow has vowed to prioritise safeguarding national security, modernising law enforcement and consolidating team culture in the force.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media after succeeding Raymond Siu on Wednesday, Chow emphasised the importance of enhancing public awareness of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After five years of the enactment of the national security law, I think, still, the society or even some members of the public... we want them to understand more about what we mean by national security," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is by far the most important because after all we understand... if we don't have any national security, I don't think that we have a very stable society at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief also said he would prioritise smart policing initiatives by leveraging technology to improve operational efficiency, work effectiveness and the quality of services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the need to cultivate cohesion within the force by fostering shared values and the sense of belonging through improved career development opportunities and more comprehensive support to officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about recent sanctions imposed on his predecessor, Chow stressed the importance of focusing on enhancing police operations amid adversity, rather than succumbing to fear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think everyone can see that the US government has used sanctions, which is a barbaric tactic, in an attempt to intimidate public officials, especially members of the police force," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its objective is to suppress us and divert our focus from national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This very reaction underscores that the measures we are implementing are effective and successful. Thus, it becomes even more important for us to intensify our efforts"
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow added that he will lead the police force with unwavering courage to confront the challenges.

    Drivers' pay rises once joining taxi fleet: operator
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of a licensed taxi fleet said drivers’ income had significantly increased since the launch of a new premium cab scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  But it also expressed concern there were not enough cabbies participating.
  <br>
  <br>
  To improve the quality of taxi services, the Transport Department has granted conditional licences to five operators to form premium fleets.
  <br>
  <br>
  SynCab is among two fleets that have piloted a trial run.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who reserve a ride from a licensed fleet of premium taxis can opt to not pay by the meter and negotiate a fare with the driver instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Wednesday, the company’s executive director, Sonia Cheng, said their fleet began operations in January and they had already noted a rise in drivers’ income.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When we look at the numbers, average drivers used to be paid, for example, HK$146 when they charge by the meter. For orders in our fleet, the average fare can reach HK$268. This is 84 percent higher than the usual drivers. Over the past three months, we have provided 44,000 passenger trips,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said 30 percent of their customers made bookings on their ride hailing platform and this is one thing many drivers struggle to adjust to as they used to take instant orders from people flagging down a taxi on the street.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the timeline for starting a full operation, she said their fleet currently has about 100 taxis and needs at least 150 more to fulfil the government's requirement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same programme, Ho Chi-keung from the Motor Transport Workers General Union said from his understanding, drivers were not so enthusiastic about joining a licensed fleet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are three main reasons: firstly, they got used to their current work mode. They may face problems with their roster after joining a fleet,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Secondly, it's about the holidays. Some drivers are now working three or four days a week, so it could be hard for them to adjust. It’s also about the deposit. They may need to pay a deposit once joining the fleet.”
  <br>
  <br>
  "That’s why drivers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said fleet operators should be more proactive in approaching the drivers and to explain to them the relevant terms, including whether a basic salary and holiday are provided and whether there's an employment relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department has said that the five operators need to commence full services by July to receive the official licence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, transport minister Mable Chan said the department has allowed room for fleet operators and drivers to negotiate how they collaborate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fleet operators should have their own ideas in how to attract drivers. I hope improvements can be made through greater market competition," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall speaking, when the Transport Department granted the conditional licences earlier, we cautiously reviewed the individual proposals. We preserved some flexibility," Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drivers and operators may not establish an employment relationship. But they share the same vision."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said she has high hopes that the operators will be well-prepared by July.

    'Subsidised homes give hope to youngsters'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Wednesday said authorities are rolling out about 50,000 subsidised residential flats in the next five years to make it easier for youngsters to own a home.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Ho said although it is difficult for young people to afford a private residential flat, the mindset that youngsters needed to start queuing for public housing when they are 18 years old must be changed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Highlighting the importance of Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats, she said it is essential to have a continuous housing supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho pointed out the government had rolled out 9,000, 8,000 and 7,000 HOS flats in 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively, adding that the flats the government has in the pipeline could give them hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Looking ahead, we will gradually roll out 45,000 units in the next five years, with the supply from Hong Kong Housing Society, there could be nearly 50,000 flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It will give hope for young people to afford to buy their own home, and to strive for upward social mobility, so they won’t try lowering their income just to comply with the asset limits for public housing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the average price for last year’s HOS flats was HK$2.7 million, and people can get a mortgage of up to 90 percent from banks, meaning they need to save over HK$300,000 for a downpayment with a monthly repayment of around HK$11,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not that unattainable,” Ho added.

 A 25-year-old Hong Kong man wanted by the police for his alleged involvement in a murder in Fo Tan last month has been arrested in Pattaya, Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  He will be deported from the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai media quoted the country's Immigration Bureau as saying that officers made the arrest at a rented house in a beach town on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, identified only as Truong, was with his Thai girlfriend at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was reported that Hong Kong authorities had sought assistance from Thailand after an arrest warrant was issued.
  <br>
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing has named Joe Chow as the new Commissioner of Police, replacing Raymond Siu.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chow was appointed by the State Council following a nomination and suggestion put forward by Chief Executive John Lee, according to Xinhua News Agency on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He takes over the reins of the force on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new police chief joined the force in 1995 as an inspector and spent most of his career in criminal investigation and intelligence gathering.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was assigned temporarily to Interpol in France between 2012 and 2013 as a criminal intelligence officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow, who had been a deputy regional commander of Kowloon West at one stage, was known for leading a police operation at the Polytechnic University during the 2019 protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  He further rose through the ranks with a series of promotions since 2020 and assumed the number-two position in the force by 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  As deputy police chief, his public appearances included hosting press conferences relating to test runs for the Kai Tak Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee pointed to Chow's "extensive experience" in a number of areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has a distinguished performance and possesses proven leadership skills. I am confident that he will capably lead the police force in meeting the challenges ahead," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu ends his decades-long career with the force by taking his leave on Wednesday. He first took charge of the force in 2021 and had his tenure extended by two years when he reached the retirement age in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Lee's statement, the chief executive expressed heartfelt appreciation, saying: "Since taking up the appointment as Commissioner of Police in June 2021, Mr Siu has made commendable efforts in maintaining Hong Kong as one of the safest cities in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has demonstrated unswerving dedication and determination to safeguarding Hong Kong and upholding the rule of law in dealing with the social unrest... Under his eminent leadership, the police force has continued to excel as a world-class professional law enforcement agency."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism minister Rosanna Law said on Tuesday any plans to expand Hong Kong Disneyland with public funding should be carefully considered, especially in the current economic climate.
 <br>
  <br>
  She made the comment as lawmakers discussed the theme park's record-breaking profits and visitor numbers last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Legislative Council economic development panel meeting, some councillors noted the park saw a significant growth in mainland and overseas visitor numbers last year, and that officials should think about relaunching Disneyland's second phase development.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Law noted that besides financing, authorities should proceed with caution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the upward trend continues, will the shareholders have the investment appetite for another project within the current theme park, or even the park's second phase development?" she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For these things, we need to observe a bit more, like whether the source markets of visitors really keep growing in a stable manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other lawmakers asked the park about its plans to attract more visitors from the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Disneyland's managing director, Michael Moriarty, noted that a pretty high proportion of visitors from the region visit the theme park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you were to look at our attendance from arrivals in the Middle East, it's one out of every three person on every plane. So I think we are very attractive to our guests in the Middle East," he told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moriarty added that besides Halal food, the park also offers praying facilities for Muslims.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong has issued a stern warning against the United States for sanctioning six officials, saying such punitive actions are simply "a piece of waste paper."
 <br>
  <br>
  The US placed Dong Jingwei, the director for the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong, along with five other SAR officials on its sanctions list.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the office on Tuesday said Washington's sanctions were "nothing but a piece of waste paper."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said: "[The office] strongly condemned the actions of the United States and sternly warned that any attempt by external forces to interfere in Hong Kong's efforts to safeguard national security would be up against a brick wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington should stop its bullying tactics as soon as possible, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said sanctions from the US would not undermine the determination of central and SAR authorities in safeguarding national security and the city's rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's liaison office, for its part, said it's only natural and necessary for the Hong Kong government to target anti-China rioters who sought to endanger national security.

    Ng On-yee happy that billiards keep Tier A status

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China snooker star Ng On-yee said a decision by the government last week allowing billiards to retain its Tier A status will help the players as well as the sport's overall development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR snooker queen returned to Hong Kong on Tuesday after defending her title at the British Open in Walsall, England with a hard-fought 4-3 victory over Mink Nutcharut of Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Ng said maintaining billiards' Tier A status not only provides important recognition for athletes, but also allows coaches to develop better training programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two key factors allowed me to play more freely in this tournament – first, having already secured my World Snooker Tour qualification early, and second, knowing that snooker would maintain its status at the Sports Institute. These significantly reduced my pressure," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng added that the move will give more confidence to young athletes developing their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also spoke about getting into the right frame of mind in the British Open final when her opponent rallied from a 3-0 deficit to force a decisive seventh and final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was leading 3-0, I started thinking just one more frame to win, and that's when I got a bit tight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After being pulled back to 3-3, I told myself to stop over-thinking – just treat it like the first frame again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Focus on taking every chance that comes, forget what's happened before, and concentrate completely on the current frame."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng will next play in the World Women’s Snooker Championship 2025 in Dongguan between May 20 and 27.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested two people after busting a cannabis production facility in Ta Kwu Ling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cannabis plants and buds worth HK$5 million were seized in a raid on Monday at a three-storey house in Ping Yeung village.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they found the cannabis spread across five rooms on the first and second floors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we also found that each room was installed with equipment which enhanced the cultivation of cannabis. These included powerful sun lamps, light-blocking cloths, insulation cotton and fertilisers," said inspector Ng Ka-wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the plants were able to produce up to 90kg of cannabis buds per year, with a street value of HK$20 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 43-year-old woman was detained at the scene on suspicion of cultivating cannabis plants and trafficking in dangerous drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 42-year-old man was arrested in Yuen Long the same day on the same charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair are due to appear before a magistrate in Fanling on Wednesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The English Schools Foundation (ESF) on Tuesday proposed to raise tuition fees by an average of 4.8 percent in the coming academic year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Parents will have to pay about HK$650 to HK$750 more per month, depending on the grade their children are in.
  <br>
  <br>
  The international school group said the proposed increase is linked to continued uncertainty in the Hong Kong economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We know that the Hong Kong economy, like that of the world more generally, continues to face uncertainties,” ESF's chief executive Belinda Greer said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We honour that trust by controlling our costs and making sure that every dollar, every cent is spent for the benefit of our students and their futures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the group has taken into consideration the question of affordability while making sure that teaching quality will not be affected.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home affairs minister Alice Mak said on Tuesday that the number of cases a district councillor handles in a year may not fully reflect the actual work done.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than a year after councillors took office following revamped district-level polls, their first annual work reports were recently made public.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked why some of them handled more than a thousand cases and some little more than a hundred, Mak said circumstances can vary and some cases could be more complicated than others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the authorities also introduced a new scheme where councillors have to meet the public regularly, for the people to file complaints or seek help.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said some residents have complained that the sessions, held at community centres, were rather inconvenient.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said officials have made changes to the scheme in a couple of districts, and they will try to adopt such changes in more communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can make things more convenient....The people said 'Of course I won't go there, I'd rather find the councillor in his or her office near my home'," she told reporters after attending an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we're trying to improve this by asking councillors to take turns in setting up street booths as 'mobile reception rooms', so the public can contact them easier."
  <br>
  <br>
  Various local media reports have noted that the public and the press could only check the work reports in a district council office and not online, and they couldn't take pictures of the reports, including documents on expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak stressed that the arrangements follow established practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the current-term councils as having unprecedented transparency, saying there have never been so many systemic statistics available regarding the work of district councillors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's university entrance exams began on Tuesday, with some candidates arriving early to avoid potential issues with the electronic check-in system.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 4,000 students registered for the first written exam in visual arts at venues across the city. They needed to use the "Check-in Smart" app before taking the exams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, there were technical glitches with both the "Check-in Smart" app and "i-Invigilation". Exam officials have since dropped the app for invigilators.
  <br>
  <br>
  At an exam venue in Kwun Tong, candidates arrived up to an hour before the scheduled start time, carrying art supplies and drawing boards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Check-in Smart app] wasn't successful last year. But we rehearsed at school so it's okay. Having the admission form is fine anyway. If something goes wrong for one person, it affects everyone, so it's not a big deal," one student said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Examinations and Assessment Authority rolled out an updated version of the app following last year's technical failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 55,000 students have registered for the DSE exams this year, a 10 percent increase from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm nervous and couldn't eat breakfast. I haven't been sleeping well. After all, it's the first day of exams," said one student.
  <br>
  <br>
  Core subjects including Chinese, English, mathematics, and citizenship and social development will start from Wednesday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local political groups have denounced Washington's move to put six mainland and Hong Kong officials on its sanctions list.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the DAB on Tuesday staged a protest outside the US consulate in Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party’s vice-chairman Holden Chow, who was among the demonstrators, called the sanctions an "ill-intentioned" move to suppress China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The US government has spread a lot of falsehoods against the Hong Kong government and our judiciary too, especially over the verdicts for those criminals who are found guilty in court because of national security cases,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's sort of a political move with the aim of suppressing China.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commissioner’s Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong earlier said China will take strong and resolute countermeasures in response to the wrong moves by the US side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said this may include counter-sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And I'm sure that when they carry out the counter sanctions or other measures to counter the US ill-intentioned move, they will be effective,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance also strongly condemned the sanctions and urged Washington to stop meddling in China's internal matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, it accused the Trump administration of ignoring the fact that Hong Kong has maintained a stable business environment for global investors, including American businesses, since the city’s national security law was put in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called on the business community and all sectors of society to stand united, support the governance of the SAR and safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions also triggered strong words from the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU).
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTU said Washington's "shameless act" will be spurned by people around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president Stanley Ng said the US is simply shooting itself in the foot with the sanctions.

 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam has stressed sanctions imposed by the United States "had no impact on him" and didn't affect his work and life, saying the best way to respond is to "remain calm and collected."
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam, along with five other mainland and Hong Kong officials, were the latest to be placed on Washington's sanctions list.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, he said the grounds for imposing sanctions are "completely untenable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also called Washington's move a blatant act of hegemony and bullying that was an attempt to deter those involved in safeguarding national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  To respond, he said, one should safeguard national security and interests, as well as Hong Kong's stability and prosperity more resolutely.

    'Schools welcome proposed NET scheme changes'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A school representative said on Tuesday that proposed changes to the Native-speaking English Teacher (NET) scheme gives headteachers more flexibility.
 <br>
  <br>
  From the next academic year, schools could be able to either keep their existing NET, or opt for a grant from the Education Bureau to employ at least one NET and native-English-speaking teaching assistants or related services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Primary schools can get HK$900,000 for one year, while secondary schools will receive up to HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HK$900,000 divided by 12 months, that would be around HK$70,000 a month. That would be enough to hire teachers with no teaching experience, and there would be [money] remaining for schools to hire teaching assistants or get other education services," Cheung Chok-fong, who chairs the Subsidised Primary School Council, said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This allows schools to choose whether to keep their own NET, or get the cash funding from the bureau. Schools can then make more flexible arrangements," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said she hoped the bureau will also look into streamlining applications for subsidies, such as housing allowances, to reduce administration work within schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Tang Fei expressed concern that proposed stricter requirements for future NETs would reduce the number of applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials are suggesting that such teachers be required to hold a bachelor's degree majoring in English, a postgraduate teaching qualification and a certificate in teaching English as a second or foreign language.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, applicants only need a degree in any subject and the teaching English certificate.

    Top court overturns ex-lawmaker's acquittal

<img alt="In a 3-2 ruling, the Court of Final Appeal overturns former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting's acquittal. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798417_1_20250401121740.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has overturned the acquittal of a former lawmaker for revealing that a police officer who was on duty during clashes in Yuen Long amid the 2019 protests was facing an anti-graft probe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruling in favour of the government, the Court of Final Appeal restored Lam Cheuk-ting's conviction and sentence on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, the former lawmaker was sentenced to four months in prison for disclosing an inquiry by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) into misconduct allegations against a police officer, Yau Nai-keung.
  <br>
  <br>
  A High Court judge later quashed Lam's conviction on three counts of disclosing probe details under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Department of Justice was granted permission to take the appeal against the former lawmaker's acquittal to the top court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal's ruling centred on two possible interpretations of a section under the ordinance, which stipulates protections against the disclosure of bribery and corruption probes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ordinance bans anyone with knowledge of an ongoing corruption investigation from disclosing the identity of the person involved, or the fact that the individual is subject to a probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  One interpretation, the bench said, adopted "a literal approach" that confined protections against the disclosure of bribery and corruption probes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other, which read the ordinance contextually and purposively, required "nothing more than the disclosure of the existence of an investigation that is underway".
  <br>
  <br>
  The court's decision was split three against two, with the majority – Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, Justice Roberto Ribeiro and non-permanent judge James Allsop – ruling that Lam's disclosure of a misconduct probe fell within the scope of the anti-graft ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their Lordships preferred the second construction as it better reflected the statutory intent to preserve the efficacy or integrity of ICAC investigations into corruption offences and to protect the reputation of subject persons," the judgement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such an interpretation was preferable because "either the disclosure of fact or details may prejudice the investigation," Ribeiro wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing his fellow judge, Cheung said simply revealing the fact that an individual was under investigation would amount to a prohibited disclosure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judges Joseph Fok and Johnson Lam disagreed, saying the law specifically refers to the disclosure of someone who's under a corruption investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting a previous amendment of the ordinance that narrowed the scope of law, Fok said the purpose of the current section was to protect the integrity of a bribery probe "rather than an ICAC investigation in general."

    Dongjiang water fuels HK's economic miracle: Lee

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday Dongjiang water has fuelled Hong Kong's economic miracle, contributing to the city's sustainable development and long-term prosperity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the International Water Pioneers Summit, Lee said the SAR's water supply is closely tied to the mainland, with 70 to 80 percent of water coming from the Dongjiang River.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forum brings together around 400 officials, academics and water experts from around the world to discuss new opportunities in waterworks development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's water story is one of transformation, illustrating how a city with limited water resource, can turn geographic and resource limitations into engineering triumphs," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's water story is also one of deep and abiding ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because without the strong bonds and blood relation between Hong Kong and the mainland, the engineering, and the water it made possible, would not have taken place."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted that the water supply capacity increased twelvefold from 68.2 million to 820 million cubic metres with expansions of the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water Supply Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted Hong Kong's vision to become an international infrastructure centre, adding that the Digital Water Office was set up last year to invest in innovative solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same forum, Minister of Water Resources Li Guoying said Beijing is committed to supporting the SAR's water supply despite the growing threat coming as a result of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we will actively support Hong Kong in leveraging its unique advantages of having the motherland's backing while being connected to the world, fully playing its role as a bridge and window to share water management concepts, experiences and solutions with countries worldwide," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong governor Wang Weizhong, meanwhile, outlined plans to enhance cooperation with Hong Kong in water management through technological innovation, particularly in AI applications.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing has warned of "strong and resolute" countermeasures against fresh sanctions imposed on six mainland and Hong Kong officials by the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a strongly worded statement on Tuesday, the Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong accused Washington of smearing the "One Country, Two Systems" principle and slandering the city's rule of law, democracy, freedom and human rights situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a gross interference in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs, and a serious violation of the principles of international law and the basic norms governing international relations," a statement by the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said the move to impose sanctions has once again exposed Washington's "evil intentions" of undermining the SAR's prosperity and stability, as well as containing China's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will surely take strong and resolute countermeasures," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the officials sanctioned are Dong Jingwei, the director of the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong; justice chief Paul Lam; and outgoing police commissioner Raymond Siu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR police have taken lawful actions against overseas anti-China rioters, and the SAR judicial authorities have independently and impartially tried national security cases following legal procedures," the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These acts are consistent with international law and customary practice, and are just and necessary moves to safeguard national security and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in the US also condemned the sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese central government resolutely supports the law enforcement and judicial authorities of the Hong Kong SAR in carrying out their duties in accordance with the law and punishing acts that undermine national security," the embassy said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US side to respect the facts, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop smearing Hong Kong's democracy and rule of law."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Tuesday condemned the United States after the US put six mainland and Hong Kong officials on its sanctions list.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government said the move exposed US barbarity under its hegemony. It also said it would not be intimidated and that SAR officials would continue to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officials concerned are Dong Jingwei, the director for the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong; Paul Lam, the Secretary for Justice; Raymond Siu, the Police Commissioner; Sonny Au, the secretary-general for the committee for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong; Dick Wong, assistant commissioner of the police - national security; and Margaret Chiu, assistant commissioner of police - national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact is that the US has been ignoring the non-interference principle under international law, interfering with other countries' internal affairs, grooming agents, instigating 'colour revolutions', creating social unrest and multiple humanitarian disasters through economic and military coercion, causing suffering to people in many countries," an SAR government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it has the responsibility to pursue, in accordance with the law, those who are suspected to have committed offences endangering national security and absconded overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the US State Department accused the officials of using Hong Kong national security laws extraterritorially in relation to 19 people who had fled overseas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday reaffirmed its resolute opposition to moves that infringe upon and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonic practices or bullying.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun made the remarks in response to a media query related to CK Hutchison's planned sale of certain port assets to a BlackRock-led group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have taken note of relevant reports," Guo said at a regular press briefing, adding that "the State Administration for Market Regulation is aware of the deal and will conduct a review in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo emphasised that China has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion and bullying to infringe upon and undermine the legitimate rights and interests of other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office has reposted another article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper criticising the proposed sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article quoted Hong Kong business and political figures as saying deals like this may involve national interests, and CK Hutchison should consider how its decision would impact the SAR and the country. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Monday announced a series of smart measures in accident and emergency departments and wards to better monitor patients and reduce medical mishaps.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among them is a geofencing system aimed at preventing dementia patients from wandering off which will be used in all hospitals by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  If a patient with a special wristband walks too close to an exit door, an alarm will sound to alert hospital staff, said the authority's director of quality and safety Michael Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they get away from our accident and emergency departments, it will be very difficult for us to find them. And they might have some accident or deterioration during the missing period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the authority will expand its use of smart oxygen cylinders with alarms that activate when the main switch isn't turned on before use.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the gas is nearly empty, it will also have an alarm. It will ensure that our staff will turn on the main switch and ensure that if the gas is running out, we will replace a new one as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the authority is also implementing a new reporting system that will use AI and big data to analyse trends and patterns in medical blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can make use of the data to have early trending and to find out the common contributing factors to incidents so as to prevent future similar events from happening," said Raymond Cheung, a chief manager with the authority.

 Four of the world’s top football teams will be coming to Hong Kong this summer for pre-season friendlies as they gear up for the 2025-26 season, organisers said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  English Premier League giant Liverpool and Serie A side AC Milan will face off on July 26 for the Standard Chartered Trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two other English Premier League teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur will meet on July 31, marking the first north London derby outside of the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two games will take place at the new 50,000-capacity Kai Tak Stadium, with the retractable roof closed and air conditioning under each seat to make the upcoming hot and humid weather more bearable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rachael Carroll, managing director of TEG sport, organiser and promoter of the festival, said the Hong Kong Football Festival will attract at least 100,000 fans both locally and from outside the SAR, which will generate great value for the local economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a wonderful opportunity to really launch Kai Tak Sports Park globally, really put this on the map, and these are fantastic rivalries and to have these two big matches, two great rivalries to really celebrate the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park and have the eyes of the world on Hong Kong, we thought that that was appropriate," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course in the future, we would love to see international teams play local teams here in the market as well, so we think that this is going to be a great location for football in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser also said the three Premier League clubs will also hold open training sessions on July 24, 29 and 30 for fans to watch before the two exhibition matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ticket details will be announced shortly by the organiser.

 Hong Kong has become a lot cleaner in recent times with scores of rear lanes tidied up, dog mess issues resolved and waste dumping brought to an end in various locations, the government said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration said it has removed more than 600 sites from its "hygiene black spot" list after tackling issues that also included wild birds congregating, graffiti, rodent infestations, abandoned vehicles and shop front extensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only around 100 problem sites remain on the list that was first compiled in 2022, suffering from the above problems and other headaches such as illegally parked bicycles and dripping air-conditioners
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hygiene conditions at 94 percent (696) of the hygiene black spots on the list have been markedly improved and could be considered for removal from the black spot list," said Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government's work on tackling hygiene black spots is ongoing. The departments concerned will continue to sustain their efforts and closely monitor the hygiene conditions of these spots. Prompt actions will be taken in case of any change of circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also expressed gratitude for efforts over the past two years to revamp the cityscape and hygiene conditions.

 Officials have brushed off concerns that landlords might be hesitant about getting their dwellings declared as basic housing units under the planned new regulatory regime for subdivided flats, saying they would not consider extending a registration period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration on Monday also suggested the possibility of establishing a reporting mechanism on homes breaching such rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the government proposal, landlords will be given 12 months to register their properties before having three years to make necessary improvements to be certified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't see why owners would not register if they intend to continue to operate," Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong told lawmakers when asked if registration numbers are low.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're not going to extend the [registration] period... The consequence of not registering is serious."
  <br>
  <br>
  To be certified as a basic housing unit, owners must hire a building professional who checks if the flat meets a set of prescribed requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is also payable to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said the administration is considering charging landlords by residential units and that officials will study suggestions that fees should be based on home sizes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also addressed worries from lawmakers that some landlords might not comply with the regulations and operate subpar homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The design of the [basic housing unit] regime comes with a very sufficient grace period and registration period," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our requirements are very pragmatic... These are all doable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We may need a reporting mechanism to catch the most serious cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is hoping to introduce a bill on regulating the compact homes in the latter half of this year.

    HK 'remains art hub despite global market decline'

<img alt="Lindsay Dewar says declining sales at events such as Art Basel Hong Kong reflect a global trend. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798264_1_20250331161511.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong just wrapped up another year of art festivals, including Art Basel and Art Central this month, and they have led an investor to say the city remains an important hub for the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=1014051&livetime=20250331000000" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , ArtTactic chief operating officer Lindsay Dewar said last year was a tough one for the market since its peak back in 2022 and despite its recovery from the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The year saw a decline of 27 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, she said there is "a new normality" in the market and "people are finding their footing again."
  <br>
  <br>
  On a notable decline in modern and contemporary art sales in the SAR and the mainland, Dewar says Hong Kong remains the third largest art centre worldwide for auction sales and that market sales globally has doubled over the past 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's really remarkable to see a market grow so much in such a relatively short period and that really speaks to the confidence the art community sees in Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dewar also noted that Hong Kong still accounts for up to 81 percent of total art sales in both the SAR and the mainland, showing its importance in this portion of the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on a decline in auction turnover at Art Basel Hong Kong recently, Dewar thinks it reflects more of the general world market trend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is kind of a broader trend that we're seeing, and it's worth bearing in mind that the sale we had in London at the beginning of this month was also down," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dewar also noted that a new generation of art collectors is emerging that is seeking more affordable artworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Latest tariff uncertainties and reduced returns over assets recently have impacted the global art market, and Dewar believes there are two main impacts.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said shorter holding periods are one of them, with people being less speculative and wanting to hold on to their artworks longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another is that market may become more regional.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a while after Covid people are looking at the market and thinking where's the best part of the market for me to sell in... whereas now we might see people saying I'm in Hong Kong and I'm going to stay in Hong Kong... so like the American market may become more American," Dewar said.

    Data breach of 128,000 'due to system fix and neglect'

 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data says a data breach incident by ImagineX has led to nearly 128,000 people’s information being compromised.
 <br>
  <br>
  Failing to delete temporary accounts in a timely manner and the use of end-of-support operating systems were the main factors leading to the breach, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privacy watchdog said in May it received a report from ImagineX Management, a brand management company, about a ransom note related to stolen personal data.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an investigation, the office found that the hacker had exploited a temporary user account and then used it to access the company’s intranet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 68GB of personal data – involving names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth months, genders and nationalities – of the nearly 128,000 people were compromised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PCPD said those affected were mostly from brands who participated in ImagineX Management ‘s two membership programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, there’s no evidence indicating the stolen data is being circulated or misused, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief personal data officer Brad Kwok said the company had set up a temporary account with remote access to fix a system problem but forgot to delete it afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This allowed the threat actor to exploit the account to compromise the network 10 days after the account was set up,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the investigation, we also found that ImagineX lacked standard procedures for creating and managing temporary accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This made the deletion of the temporary account solely dependent on measures taken by individual staff members.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the company had also used an operating system that had no longer been updated since 2020, making it vulnerable to attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also accused of having inefficient detection measures and not conducting sufficient security risk reviews and audits for its system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PCPD said it issued an enforcement notice to ImagineX as it contravened the data protection principle and urged the company to take measures to prevent similar contraventions.

    Privacy watchdog issues AI guidelines for employees

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) on Monday issued a checklist to guide organisations in regulating their employees’ use of generative artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said the checklist is important as the secure use of AI is an essential part of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the areas of technological development and industrial innovation, the country has all along stressed the equal importance of development and safety,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to implement the spirit of the Two Sessions… and in order to facilitate the safe and healthy development and use of AI in Hong Kong, my office published the checklist on guidelines for the use of generative AI by employees today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisations must specify tasks in which employees are allowed to use AI, with examples including drafting documents, summarising information and creating video and audio content.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should also clearly define which AI tools employees can use, which may include publicly-available or internally developed systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The devices that can access the AI tools should also be regulated, the PCPD noted, as organisations are advised to establish clear distinctions between work devices and personal devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisations should also spell out the penalties or review mechanisms for employees who don’t adhere to the guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said organisations need to be particularly careful if they want to train their AI models with data from clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, when you first collect the data, you did not tell them that it would be used for training AI but subsequently you want to [do so],” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And you will need to obtain the customer's expressed and voluntary consent to do that under the Privacy Ordinance.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The full checklist of the newly released guidelines is available for download on the  PCPD’s website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said a hotline has been set up for organisations to make enquiries about how to use AI safely and properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung also pointed out that the privacy watchdog has initiated compliance checks on 60 private-sector organisations and government departments to assess how responsibly they are using AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results will be finalised by summer.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The City University of Hong Kong (CityU) and the University of Cambridge signed a global research collaboration deal on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of the deal, 18 top post-doctoral researchers from around the world will be based in Cambridge, taking advantage of its laboratories and resources under supervision by principal investigators from both universities for three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  CityU council chairman Michael Ngai said the collaboration aligns with the strategic goals of the Hong Kong government.
  <br>
  <br>
  'It serves as a vital step in further establishing Hong Kong as a premier international hub of higher education," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six colleges and departments from each university will be collaborating together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key research areas range from 3D medical data to creativity in an age of intelligent machines.
  <br>
  <br>
  CityU said the institution plans to offer attractive presidential assistant professorship positions to postdoctoral fellows upon the completion of their research contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This collaboration now represents a single largest postdoctoral fellowship programme between University of Cambridge in Asia and an Asian university," CityU president Freddy Boey said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the signing ceremony, University of Cambridge vice-chancellor Deborah Prentice said "this partnership will enable these outstanding scholars to have the freedom to continue to push the frontiers of research in addressing global challenges."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that CityU has recently been recognised as the world's most international university by Times Higher Education in both 2024 and 2025.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is looking into the possibility of having a single contractor design, build and operate a planned cross-border railway in the northwestern New Territories and says officials will start gauging developers' interest later this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link, which is a key component of the Northern Metropolis, is aimed at connecting Hung Shui Kiu with Qianhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Estimated to come into operation in 2035, the proposed 18-kilometre cross-border railway is expected to take residents from one place to the other in 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan said the administration is considering different options for the project, including a "design, build and operate" contract.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the second half of the year when we invite intentions and expressions, we will then know whether [it can be] a design, build and operate [model] or whether it is [having] design and build as a contract and then operation as another contract," Chan told lawmakers on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experienced operators can take up the operation solely, or they can partner up with other operating companies."

  <br>
  Three stations along the proposed link will be in Hong Kong and two will be across the border. A co-location arrangement is expected to be adopted for immigration and customs facilities on the Shenzhen side.
  <br>
  <br>
  While some lawmakers called for both of the stations in Shenzhen to have checkpoints, the transport chief said officials are still hammering out details of the arrangement with mainland counterparts.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Tak Sports Park will "learn a good lesson" from hosting the Hong Kong Sevens and be better prepared in the future following complaints by fans over their inability to get food at the venue, a business tycoon said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some rugby fans had complained over the dearth of food at Kai Tak Stadium, where the three-day tournament was held, after the government had told operators to enhance their food supply services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're inexperienced at handling a crowd that big and I think they will learn a good lesson," said Lan Kwai Fong Group chairman Allan Zeman on RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was the first time they were slammed over three days with that many people, and not expecting how much food they could sell, how much drinks they could sell... They probably would stock up in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament has welcomed more than 110,000 visitors in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure fell short of Hong Kong China Rugby's 139,000 expectation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who is also the vice chairman of the Major Sports Events Committee, told another RTHK radio show that this might be due to the event being held in the Hong Kong Stadium for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that's because the Kai Tak venue is much bigger than Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My understanding is that 90 percent of the tickets were taken up but there's still room for more ticket sales," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the event will now have made its reputation and I hope there will be more visitors in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng, who was among those attending the Sevens, said the atmosphere was very good and that overall operations had been very smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kowloon City district councillor Cheung King-fan said there were some complaints by Kai Tak residents about noise coming from the fans' village located on the east side of the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have reflected the issue to the organiser, park operator and the Environmental Protection Department," he added.

    SAR rescue team heads for quake-stricken Mandalay

<div class="itemFullText">
 An SAR government rescue team is on its way to quake-hit Mandalay in Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 51-strong team, including firefighters, doctors and nurses, had earlier arrived in the country's capital, Naypyidaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  There, they rested briefly at the Myanmar National Centre for Disease Control and met diplomats from the Chinese embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  While they originally planned to work in Naypyidaw, Myanmar officials asked them to go to Mandalay instead – which is near the epicentre of the 7.7-magnitude quake on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rescue squad departed overnight but had to pause their journey due to a night curfew on the roads, according to a Facebook post by the Security Bureau on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The board of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison said on Monday it has not made any decision on its global telecommunications business, in response to media reports about a potential spin-off listing of the assets.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From time to time, the Group receives proposals and explores and evaluates opportunities that may be available, with a view to enhancing long term value to shareholders, including possible transactions relating to the assets and operations of the company's global telecommunication businesses," the board said in a stock exchange filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spin-off listing would be among those options, according to the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said no decision has been made about any transaction and there is no certainty a transaction will take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, the company is mulling a spin-off of global telecom assets and would list the business on the London stock exchange. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fireworks display capped off a three-day rugby extravaganza at the Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday, bringing an end to the Hong Kong Sevens at its new home.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who was there with his wife, said he had a great time with tens of thousands of fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first major tournament at the Kai Tak Stadium has successfully 'scored a try'," Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next, let's wait for more exciting sports and cultural activities to take place, giving full play to the venue's enchantment, while looking forward to future mega events one after the other."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 38,000 spectators were on hand for the third and final day of the Sevens, according to organisers, with total attendance topping 110,000 visits over three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said overall traffic conditions were mostly smooth after the event drew to a close.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators were advised to take the MTR by going to either Kai Tak or Sung Wong Toi station.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also special bus routes, as well as a number of taxis to pick up passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, some fans complained on Sunday that they could not get food, with some stalls and vendors said to have run out of supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a tour of the venue in the afternoon, culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said she had told operators to enhance their food supply services.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the atmosphere and operations at the venue were very good in general.

 An SAR government rescue team is set to begin inspection work on the ground in earthquake-stricken Myanmar as they arrived in the country's capital Naypyidaw.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 51-member team, led by deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, were greeted by diplomats from the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video posted on the Security Bureau's Facebook page, Cheu said his squad will work with other rescue teams to assess the situation and make further action plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said earlier the SAR government has earmarked HK$30 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to help victims of the tremor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a number of international rescue organisations called for support for the quake victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyi Minn, national director of World Vision International Myanmar, talked about the devastation in a video message on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was quite a prolonged quake compared to the previous one, like nearly four to five minutes is shaking. So staff were quite nervous and could not contact anyone because all the phone lines were cut off," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed concerns about the safety of children, particularly those separated from their parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Red Cross, for its part, said it has allocated HK$200,000 in relief support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hong Kong, China Rugby Association, James Farndon, on Sunday hailed the first-ever Sevens at the Kai Tak Stadium, calling the event a massive success for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Farndon stressed the importance of the upgraded fan experience at the new venue, following nearly half a century at the Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an amazing experience for all involved," Farndon told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main point I'd make is what the experience is like for the fans -- and from what I see, it's obviously a bigger house, bigger party. The fan experience has been fantastic."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke about the popularity of the stadium's South Stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The South Stand's been rocking, and the entertainment has been fantastic too," he added. "If you look at the other aspects of the stadium we've been able to add in... it's just a lot more for the fans to experience, and I think they really enjoyed it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon also highlighted the work to bring the showpiece tournament to Kai Tak, having gone through multiple stress tests in the run-up to the three-day sporting event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a real journey for us, but a real positive one," Farndon explained. "We've had test events at various stages, which have been able to give experience to our event operations team -- to learn the back of house and how [the Sevens] is going to work for the players, coaches and the international teams coming in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Brett Robinson, the chairman of World Rugby, also spoke highly about new Kai Tak experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those of us who had the chance to be around [the stadium], and also from an athlete's perspective, it's purpose-built for the game of Sevens," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got women that are singing songs, and athletes that are just really enjoying the experience and really feeling quite valued."

 Culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said operators of Kai Tak Sports Park made improvements every day during the three-day Rugby Sevens tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Sunday afternoon at Kai Tak, Law said the atmosphere and operations at the venue were very good in general.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also had to wait in line for some time when buying a hamburger yesterday, so I told the venue operators to enhance their food supply services. The operators increased their supplies today, and I know that more staff were arranged to help out at vendors at the arena and youth sports ground," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law added that more improvements can be made in terms of the variety of food available, and whether to boost taxi services there.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also called on fans to make use of the MTR and buses to leave the venue when the Sevens draw to a close.

    Cathay plane flyover marks old airport's centennial

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Cathay Pacific aircraft on Sunday flew near Kai Tak during the Hong Kong Sevens, an area where the city's former international airport began operations 100 years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The A350 operated by the flagship carrier took off for its tour over Hong Kong at around 4pm, flying over Victoria Harbour and passing the old Kai Tak Airport runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aircraft flew at an altitude of as low as 1,100ft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some at the Kai Tak Stadium were able to see the plane through giant windows near the South Stand, while others viewed the flyover on a big screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stuart Morton, who's lived in Hong Kong for decades, said he felt nostalgic when he saw the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I first came here in 1985 with the military. I landed at Kai Tak," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It brings back memories of coming in over [Checkerboard Hill], turning around and then coming and landing at Kai Tak."
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor Mavi Mbochay said the flyover served as a reminder of what the stadium used to be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just symbolises the history. It's important to connect the past and the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flyover marked the centennial of the old airport.

 Rugby lovers from Hong Kong and beyond filled up the Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday to enjoy a final day of sport and partying at the Hong Kong Sevens.
 <br>
  <br>
  Now in its new home, the annual rugby showcase isn't just about the action on the pitch. The food and drinks, the raucous atmosphere and the people are also what attracted fans to the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brian Hopkins, who supports Great Britain, said the Sevens is the perfect occasion to celebrate his 40th birthday.

   "There's no better place to do it. It's a great atmosphere, great rugby, great stadium as well," he told RTHK. "We tried the food, we tried plenty of drinks... It's going to be a keg of Guinness against my name."
   <br>
   <br>
   For Donna Hopkins, the stadium was friendly to wheelchair users.
   <br>
   <br>
   "Down and around here, I could get to the food, the toilets were really accessible. I could see the pitch really well," she said.

    Brett Muntz, who grew up in Fiji and now lives in New Zealand, stuck to his roots and supports the Flying Fijians.
    <br>
    <br>
    "It's all about the people, connecting and enjoying a magnificent occasion and this magnificent venue," he said. "Everyone seems to come for the right reason - have a good time, meet people, enjoy, and leave the results on the field and celebrate together."

     Epeli Buliciri, also a Fiji fan, was adding this year's Hong Kong Sevens to his impressive resume.
     <br>
     <br>
     "This is my 122nd tournament. It's my 17th Hong Kong Sevens tournament," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "Hong Kong is always special for Fiji. Even sometimes when life gets down and all that, you can always rely on the Hong Kong Sevens and the Fiji team to get you back up there."
     <br>
     <br>
     His hat with a glistening pin collection was not the only one competing for attention at the stadium.

      "The dedication we've put in is really great, because we have to put paint on us. I think we have the best costume," said one of them.
      <br>
      <br>

       Others drew inspiration from Freddy, an animated weatherman on local TV.
       <br>
       <br>
       The group said they planned for their costume one month or two ago, and chose one relating to rainy conditions.

<img alt="Christopher Hui says the SAR is an attractive destination for capital and family offices. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798116_1_20250330155453.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The controversy over CK Hutchison's plans to sell dozens of ports won't affect family offices' interest in investing in Hong Kong, financial services minister Christopher Hui said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV programme, Hui said those attending the Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit last week did not raise concerns about the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 160 family offices from around the world indicated they will or are planning to set up shop in Hong Kong, of which a quarter are from Europe and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So as you can see, I think there has been absolutely no impact. We continue to be an ideal destination for attracting capital and especially for family offices and other institutions to establish themselves here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui also said the government is planning to amend legislation to expand tax concessions for family office investments, covering loans, virtual assets and carbon credits.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed confidence that the number of family offices in Hong Kong would increase from 2,700 to over 3,000 in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the US$23 billion port deal between CK Hutchison and a consortium led by American investment firm BlackRock, which includes strategic assets along the Panama Canal, won't be signed as expected this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing officials in charge of SAR affairs have reposted a number of commentaries at the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, criticising the proposed sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest piece reposted by the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Sunday, political and business leaders were quoted as saying that the impact of the proposed deal extends beyond commerce to national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article said various sectors in Hong Kong support the move by the State Administration for Market Regulation to examine the deal, adding it is critical for safeguarding fair competition and national interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged CK Hutchison to reconsider the deal, quoting a number of Hong Kong lawmakers as saying it's naive to view it as a business matter only, given the complex international environment.

<img alt="Paul Chan says he hopes more people will do business in Hong Kong apart from enjoying art. Image courtesy of Paul Chan's blog" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798103_1_20250330133135.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said "Super March" has attracted more than 3.4 million visitors to Hong Kong, a 12 percent increase from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  As of Friday, non-mainland arrivals this month reached 960,000, accounting for almost 30 percent of the total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan also said hotel occupancy at popular areas was near 90 percent, while the retail sector also said the increased foot traffic helped their business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has hosted more than 10 major events this month, including snooker's World Grand Prix, the Rugby Sevens and the Art Basel art fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan wrote on his blog that when he spoke to visitors and exhibitors at the Art Basel, he expressed hope that more people will do business in Hong Kong apart from enjoying art.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also said the new Kai Tak Sports Arena has provided a larger venue and finer facilities for events such as the Rugby Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attendance at the Sevens is expected to top 140,000 from Friday to Sunday, and all hospitality boxes have been sold out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many business representatives attending financial events in Hong Kong this week told me that they look forward to watching matches and participating in other cultural events to experience the vibrancy of the city, in addition to having business meetings," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the administration will continue to promote its mega-events economy to attract more high-end business travellers to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government will encourage and support businesses to develop more special products and services, to make Hong Kong a prosperous and enjoyable place.

 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Sunday said the force's efforts to raise its image among young people were bearing fruit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Siu said the police have been spreading the message that the force is acting for the benefit of young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We asked a university to conduct public opinion research last year and the results are encouraging. It surveyed young people aged 18 to 29 on their views towards the police force and the force's ratings have increased by almost 38 percent. This shows that our efforts over the past few years have not been wasted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that the force had faced unprecedented challenges during the 2019 social unrest but that officers had remained united while under great pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said frontline staff had contributed greatly to the city moving from chaos to order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu will step down from his post on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the force will continue to work hard and tell citizens clearly what kind of a team we are. I think the Hong Kong Police Force is the most efficient, empathetic and passionate in the world when it comes to police work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said he would miss working for the force.
