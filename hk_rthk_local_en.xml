  The first case involves a man, aged 25 who had flown in from Frankfurt, and a 24-year woman who was arrested later at Hong Kong International Airport. The second involves a 47-year-old woman who had flown from Frankfurt, via Taipei.

    Hong Kong Food Festival sees dip in footfall

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vendors at the Hong Kong Food Festival have remained conservative on sales with some finding less visitors this year than before.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-day event ending Sunday began on Christmas Day at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  One merchant, surnamed Lok, said the weeks-long Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo in Causeway Bay has pulled away potential customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's obviously because the Brands and Products Expo is being held at Victoria Park at the same time. It opened a day earlier than us. Its admission fee is HK$10, and here, it is HK$30. Admissions are free there after 7pm, but people still need to pay here," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the perspective of consumers, I think they will go to the expo and check out local brands."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the drop in footfall, vendor Wong said his business saw a 15 to 20 percent jump from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, people are relatively more willing to spend. It's true that there are fewer people than previously, but the purchasing power is stronger," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A resident, surnamed Mak, said he spent around HK$1,000 at the festival.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't normally buy this much. I bought more than usual because of the variety and promotions," he said. “There were less people this year, it was more crowded last year. It could be because some left Hong Kong to spend elsewhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's food festival was held alongside several other shopping events, with around 1,000 booths participating in total.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang has described the successful enactment of the national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law this year as the most formidable challenge of his career.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a video shared on his social media platform on Sunday, he said he and his team fearlessly hit back at smears and refuted false accusations along the way.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he managed to put up with a number of physical ailments as he and his colleagues worked on the legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I remember the time when I suffered from inflamed eyes due to a lack of sleep. My frozen shoulder and gout also relapsed. However, witnessing all my colleagues tirelessly working day and night, I forgot about these minor inconveniences. At that time, none of us could even keep track of how many takeaway meals we had," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were driven by a determination to face challenges head-on, so we persevered. Eventually, the legislation was passed unanimously, allowing me to feel truly honoured to have completed this historic mission hand in hand with my comrades. Upholding national security is our mission. Promoting national security and patriotic education is also our duty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also highlighted changes in immigration policies for the SAR this year, such as bringing back multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and introducing mainland travel cards for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the security chief said he and his colleagues will continue to push ahead with various stress tests at Kai Tak Sports Park to ensure the smooth opening of the facility.

 Respiratory health expert David Hui on Sunday called on people to get vaccinated as soon as possible, saying there’s been a rise in influenza cases in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV programme, the professor of respiratory medicine at Chinese University said both public hospitals and private clinics have reported an increase in patients with flu symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said he’s expecting the flu season to peak next month, as people wrap up their holidays and return from places which saw outbreaks of H1N1 flu like the mainland, Japan, and Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expert reminded high risk groups, including the elderly, children and those who’re overweight, to stay vigilant and get their flu jabs if they haven't already done so.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour Department (LD) said it is deeply concerned about a fatal accident at a construction site in Yau Ma Tei, in which a 53-year-old worker was killed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the male worker was struck by a falling glass panel while it was being lifted with a set of lifting equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the accident happened at a site above the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned, suspending all curtain wall installation work of the construction site, including lifting and handling of glass panels. The contractors cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims also said on Sunday that it is saddened and very concerned about the accident, and called on the Labour Department to be transparent with its findings.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will provide the worker’s family with support and assistance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong's economy remains strong and resilient, despite potential market volatility stemming from uncertainties like geopolitics and high interest rates by 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing in his weekly blog, Chan said Hong Kong's asset market has shown substantial improvement, with the local stock market rising by about 18 percent this year and the Hang Seng Index rebounding to 20,000 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trading volume has also significantly increased, reaching a historical high of over HK$600 billion in a single day in October. This year, the average daily trading volume exceeds HK$132 billion, up more than 25 percent from last year," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The initial public offering (IPO) market has also become more active, with fundraising from new listings exceeding HK$80 billion, ranking fourth globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said family office businesses are also thriving, with about 2,700 single family offices now operating in the SAR. Additionally, the number of companies from the mainland and overseas in Hong Kong has nearly reached 10,000, including around 4,700 start-ups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also pointed out that authorities are actively working to attract more professionals to Hong Kong, having received approximately 410,000 applications through various talent schemes over the past two years, and approving around 260,000 of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan acknowledged that the retail and dining sectors continue to face challenges, but he believes that the reintroduction of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, along with the holiday season, will bring in more visitors and give the industry a much needed boost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead to the new year, he stressed that Hong Kong will continue to capitalise on its unique advantages, enhance systematic investment in local innovation and technology, and solidify the SAR's position as an international financial, trade, and shipping hub.

    'Mainland tourists' spending power is normalising'

<img alt="Quality Tourism Services Association chairman Simon Wong says the catering and retail industries need to adapt. File Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785288_1_20241228125627.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Quality Tourism Services Association on Saturday reassured the catering and retail sectors that they will still have business as long as they grasp the new consumption habits of mainland tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme, Simon Wong pointed out that the industries should not expect mainland visitors to fork out as much as they used to.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that compared to the peak of pre-Covid times, the spend for each mainland tourist who stays overnight has reduced by HK$3,000 in retail, which is the greatest among all sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said this might not be due to weaker consumption power among mainlanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The catering and retail industries should start to accept that the so-called weakening spending power of tourists from the mainland might only be them normalising their spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe we should not fantasise that their spending will be doubled within a short period of time, to be as high as in the past. It might be because their consumption power was particularly strong at that time, and it is only now normalising."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the market will not be booming, he said there will still be business for the catering and retail industries if they recognise such changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Wong estimated that businesses have surged up to 20 percent month-on-month during the Christmas holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it has dropped by 10 percent compared to a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents has also boosted the economy.

 Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) said it will expand its overseas network in search for more investment opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Startups in Hong Kong employed about 18-thousand people this year, according to the agency, which was a seven percent growth year-on-year, making a substantial contribution to the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK's director-general, Alpha Lau, said on Saturday that the government spent a lot of effort in promoting emerging sectors and companies.

  "The 2024 startup survey shows that we have got a remarkable growth in the total number of startups. Now we have 4,700, up 10 percent from last year," she said in an interview with the Information Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we have seen some new sectors emerging, indicating that the Hong Kong government’s effort to promote industries in this area has now seen a very good result."
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO of a local fintech startup, Ben Wong, said Hong Kong's well-established financial structure was vital for his company's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to be an international company and Hong Kong provides us with that base on the strategic location. In just a four-hour ride we are able to go into Southeast Asia," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talent in Hong Kong to me, when it comes to being able to support a financial business, is one of the best in the world. They are highly skilled, and also highly knowledgeable, in helping us grow our business. At the same time, we have been able to also attract international talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK said it will particularly focus on countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, and that a new office will be established in Turkey in the first quarter of next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Self-service kiosks where the public can apply for international driving permits will soon be up and running at two locations in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said they can be found at two licensing offices, in Admiralty and Cheung Sha Wan, from January 13, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a daily quota of around 32 applications per kiosk, and  drivers can make reservations from Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department's CEO of licensing, Chow Wai, said the application process will now be easier for the public with the two kiosks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can get their permit within the same day or within an hour after submitting the application. If they use the non-counter means - [applying] online, [via] drop-in box, or by post, usually it would take up to ten working days to send the permit to the applicants," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the benefits of using the kiosk is that they can save waiting time to get the permit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said drivers need an iAM Smart+ account, with a digital signing function of a valid personal digital certificate, to use the kiosks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that authorities will look into whether more licensing offices can introduce self-service kiosks.

 Technology minister Sun Dong said that the business community has a key role to play in Hong Kong's pursuit of becoming an innovation and technology hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  He told an RTHK radio programme on Saturday that I&T is crucial in attaining economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of the development of the I&T sector, it is without a doubt that the government will play an important leading role, but the government alone is not enough. The whole of society has to participate," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, the government's major challenge ahead is how to unite all sectors, particularly business, to boost the development of I&T in the coming five to ten years."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that the government will roll out land preferential measures to attract businesses to set up production lines in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau has been conducting talks with relevant organisations, such as the Science Park, and he hopes the policies can be introduced in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The measures will focus on attracting strategic enterprises to set up factories, production lines as well as actual production facilities and links that can create value to Hong Kong's economic growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, apart from providing them land at an attractive price, we will also require these companies to have a certain value of output and return to society within a certain period."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also pointed out that the first three buildings of the Hong Kong section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, are expected to be launched next year, adding that leasing arrangements are underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone that spans across the Shenzhen River consists of 87-hectare Hong Kong Park, and 300-hectare Shenzhen Park.

    Govt outlines plans for two new border towns

<img alt="In documents submitted to the legislature, the government says the planned University Town is within a priority area for development for the New Territories North New Town." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785222_1_20241227193051.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it plans to build some 180,000 flats in two new towns in northern New Territories near the border, under the final stages of the wider Northern Metropolis project.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the sites is the New Territories North New Town, which covers more than 1,400 hectares and stretches from the Heung Yuen Wai and Man Kam To border points to near Lo Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The land area accounts for about one-third of the entire Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau said on Friday there will be about 170,000 flats in the new town, housing half a million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 hectares would be considered a priority zone for development, which includes the University Town – an idea that was floated earlier – an enterprise park in Heung Yuen Wai and a commercial and residential zone near the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the priority area, officials said the plot could house new industries such as advanced construction and manufacturing. There will also be sites earmarked for sports and culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other new town is Ma Tso Lung.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's smaller in size, covering about 55 hectares, and could house around 10,000 units.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Development Bureau spokesperson said officials have scaled back the size of the Ma Tso Lung project, so it won't touch on wetland conservation zones or buffer areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added the plan is to build mostly private flats in both new towns, noting that the government's target of building 300,000 public flats over a decade is met by plots elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Excluding New Territories North and Ma Tso Lung, the government has already found land that can build 410,000 public flats," the spokesperson said. "So from this point of view, it seems we shouldn't give public flats priority when developing these two places."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another spokesperson said the two new towns could be attractive for residents who often travel across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said the development scheme would result in the eviction of 13 non-indigenous villages, three of which are in Ma Tso Lung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Construction work for the Ma Tso Lung project will begin in 2027 and that of the priority area in the New Territories North New Town is expected to start a year later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first batch of residents could move in seven years afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials will launch a two-month public consultation exercise on the preliminary plans in the middle of next month.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials have called on tourists to stay in Hong Kong overnight after the New Year countdown next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities announced earlier on Friday that service hours at two border crossings will be extended on January 1, with the Shenzhen Bay Control Point operating throughout the early morning hours and the Lo Wu Control Point staying open until 2am, two hours longer than normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials from the Transport Department said visitors could consider staying in the city after the fireworks display
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage mainland tourists to consider staying one more day in Hong Kong after the countdown, so they can fully immerse themselves in the diverse tourism experience in Hong Kong," Principal Transport Officer for the New Territories, Ken Wong, said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a 12-minute fireworks display at Victoria Harbour to usher in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Acting Superintendent for Kowloon West Traffic, Ho Chun-hin, called on people to use public transport and not to go to the Hung Hom Promenade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, some people would go to the promenade in Hung Hom to watch the fireworks. However, due to ongoing construction work there, it cannot be used as a viewing area this time. We kindly ask members of the public to choose other places," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said they will cordon off some roads in Central, Wan Chai, Eastern District and Tsim Sha Tsui in the evening on December 31.

<img alt="Cantonese opera singers Angel Leung (left) and Joyce Koi (right) will be performing one last time before the theatre closes. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785183_2_20241227153512.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cantonese opera enthusiasts are making the most of the iconic Sunbeam Theatre before it closes down in March after more than 50 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theatre in North Point is to be transformed into a church.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran Cantonese opera singer Joyce Koi on Friday described the theatre as her second home and the place where she built her fame in the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she will enjoy the remaining days performing in the theatre, adding that she hopes to see more theatre spaces open up for shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Ngai, 76, said she witnessed the history of Sunbeam Theatre, recalling fond memories of going there with her mother. Ngai said she will try to watch as many shows as she can before the theatre closes on March 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like coming home. I usually come here with my friends and family. It makes me very happy because we watch the performance and then go out for dinner. Sometimes we watch a show in the morning, go to dim sum, then another in the afternoon followed by a dinner with ten to twenty people," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference about her upcoming show, Cantonese opera singer Angel Leung, who will perform during the theatre's final days, said the venue holds many memories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think most Cantonese opera actors and actresses have a lot of memories here at Sunbeam Theatre because most of us would have been audience members sitting down there at the auditorium, and then gradually we became performers performing on this stage, and we have acted many different roles and characters on this stage, so I think every one of us [will] actually miss this place very much," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for future plans, although this venue will not be used in the future, it will be used for other religious purposes. However we still have other venues such as the West Kowloon Xiqu Centre and also some other government venues such as Ko Shan Theatre, we will still have a lot of performances there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that she hopes to see Cantonese opera continue to grow in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many things that we can do, especially focusing on promoting this art form to our next generation and also promoting it to the international audience groups," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's actually a very iconic culture in Hong Kong that represents this place because Cantonese opera in Hong Kong has its own style. I think it's really a very good way of promoting this city to foreigners."
  <br>
  <br>
  The theatre will be taken over by the Island Evangelical Community Church, with the sale spanning the ground floor through to the sixth floor, and also the rooftop of Kiu Fai Mansion.

 Service hours at two border checkpoints will be extended in the early hours of New Year's Day, the government said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen Bay Control Point, which usually closes at midnight, will stay open throughout the night, while Lo Wu Control Point will stay open an extra two hours longer than normal until 2am.
  <br>
  <br>
  East Rail Line services will be extended, with the last train to Lo Wu leaving Admiralty at 00.56am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private cars, other than those with permits for the Lok Ma Chau checkpoint, will be able to cross the border via the Shenzhen Bay port, a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An emergency transport coordination centre will operate round-the-clock to monitor traffic conditions and public transport services, and will carry out contingency measures when necessary to meet service demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman thanked mainland authorities for making the special arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The full support and co-ordination of the leaders and relevant departments of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipality are crucial to the implementation of the special boundary-crossing arrangements, reflecting the effective and close co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National People's Congress Standing Committee member Starry Lee on Friday said she hopes the newly restored multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents can be extended to cover more cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR saw more mainland visitors over Christmas, which benefited the retail, catering and hospitality sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that with the close monitoring of the implementation, more and more cities in the GBA in particular can have more relaxed visa application procedures so that more people from different cities in the Guangdong area can come to Hong Kong to visit and we can exchange more," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee earlier attended a standing committee meeting in Beijing where she said 10 bills were discussed and some, involving value-added tax, the Supervision Law and the Science and Technology Popularisation Law, were passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 14th National People's Congress will open its third annual session in the capital on March 5, and Lee described 2025 as a "critical year", saying Hong Kong should play a more active role in inviting foreign investment and attracting talent.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said the well-being of families is deeply valued by his administration, and that it strives to build a harmonious society for all.
 <br>
  <br>
  Giving the opening address for the Asian Family Summit 2024, the CE underscored the government's commitment to working with different stakeholders to cultivate a pro-family environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our latest initiatives, in partnership with the Family Council, include supporting the community in launching family education projects of an extended scope. We will also organise the Hong Kong Excellence Family Awards next year to promote good family values among the general public,” he said in a video message.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As announced in my Policy Address this October, we will strengthen parental education by setting up new community parents and children centres in different parts of the city.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive added that the Social Welfare Department’s care teams are also well-trained to identify and reach out to households in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee stressed that building a more caring and inclusive society for all families requires the effort of not only the government, but also all sectors of the community.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked organisers of the summit for assembling people who are dedicated to the healthy development of families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The summit runs until Sunday, bringing together some 700 participants from professional groups, academia, NGOs and the public to discuss challenges faced by families and review existing policies.

    Airport to expand use of unmanned vehicles

 Passengers will be able to ride on the new unmanned shuttle between the Hong Kong port of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and 11 SKIES shopping mall at Chek Lap Kok from the end of next year, Airport Authority executive director Steven Yiu said.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the shopping mall located near Terminal 2, the shuttle service is expected to boost travel between the mega bridge and the airport, and facilitate shoppers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The journey between the port and 11 SKIES will only take three minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu said 26 vehicles will be put into use in the initial stage and can carry 500 passengers an hour, with the capacity set to double later.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the 16 seaters boast state-of-the-art features.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Every car, we equip with different positioning systems. We have cameras. They are equipped with all the video and analytic functions, so they can detect any abnormality on the road,” Yiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The second is GPS. It’s not one GPS. We have four different GPS, supplied by China, the US, Russia and Europe. We have 10 radars to detect all the motions on the road so the vehicles can react.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu also said the authority plans to launch an unmanned vehicle link between the port and Tung Chung in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fleet of 100 vehicles can carry 5,000 people per hour, and the capacity would be raised to 8,000 later.
  <br>
  <br>
  A designated road will be built in Tung Chung for the unmanned vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also plans to expand the pooling service fleet for airport staff within the airport restricted area by using unmanned vehicles within two years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong travellers will soon be able to fly on the homegrown C919 aircraft from Chek Lap Kok airport, with China Eastern Airlines assigning the narrow-body passenger jet to its daily route between the SAR and Shanghai from January 1 next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The news was announced by the the Transport and Logistics Bureau on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Secretary for Transport Mable Chan thanked the Civil Aviation Administration of China for its continued strong support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move hopefully will allow more SAR residents a chance to step on the C919 and experience the remarkable achievements of the nation's aviation development. International travellers can also know more about the technological advances of China's aviation development," the post read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By assigning the C919 to a regular route between Hong Kong and Shanghai Hongqiao airports, it reflects the importance of the SAR as a global aviation hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said she has already instructed the Civil Aviation Department and the Airport Authority to provide comprehensive assistance, ensure the best experience for passengers and promote the nation's aviation achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  She earlier met representatives of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or COMAC, and thanked the company for setting up an office in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can provide assistance on many fronts, including aircraft maintenance, personnel training, as well as leasing and sale of aircraft," Chan wrote.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Thursday expressed its strong disapproval towards the extension of US sanctions under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, accusing Washington of double standards and political grandstanding.
 <br>
  <br>
  The act was first signed into law in 2019. It was extended for another five years on Monday after US President Joe Biden passed the National Defence Authorisation Act, which includes a wide range of provisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means the US government will continue to impose sanctions on mainland and Hong Kong officials involved in the enactment of laws safeguarding national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The act also demanded an annual review of Hong Kong's political situation and decide whether the SAR should continue to enjoy favourable treatment on trade relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hong Kong government spokesperson said Washington was merely trying to intimidate SAR officials who safeguard national security according to the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns its [US government] political grandstanding rife with ill intentions, which have been seen through by all. The HKSAR despises the so-called 'sanctions' and will not be intimidated by such a despicable behaviour," the spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson reminded the US that it substantial economic interest in Hong Kong, citing a trade surplus of about US$270 billion over the past decade, while nearly 1,400 American companies operate in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson reiterated that foreign governments and legislatures should not interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.

    Greenpeace laments HK's waste reduction progress

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Greenpeace campaigner on Thursday said Hong Kong saw a drop in the volume of rubbish dumped at landfills last year, but the improvement is marginal and far from satisfactory.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to statistics published by the Environmental Protection Department last week, the city's municipal solid waste dropped by 2.2 percent to 10,111 tonnes per day in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Leanne Tam said the data showed little progress was made on waste reduction over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking at the data, the reduction is not significant. Ten years ago, the government set many different waste reduction targets, such as increasing recycling rates to around 50 percent," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared to 10 years ago, our current daily municipal solid waste volume remains high at nearly 11,000 tonnes, which really isn't much of a difference."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam added that while recycling rates increased, the improvement was minimal. She pointed out that the volume of recycled plastics went up by 7,300 tonnes last year, which is equivalent to only three days' worth of plastic waste generated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increase in recycling is actually not significant. And in recent years, recycling has cost hundreds of millions in public funds annually for community recycling facilities, but this only resulted in a one percent increase this year. We believe this shows poor cost-effectiveness and efficiency," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advocate said the focus should shift more towards reducing waste at source rather than just recycling, including implementing reusable tableware systems and encouraging people to bring their own containers through incentives.

    Catering business merry this Christmas

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785032_1_20241226131102.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering representative said business was up 8 percent compared to last year during Christmas, despite residents travelling out of Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's partly attributed to the resumption of the multi-entry visa for Shenzhen residents as well as the SAR hosting activities such as a pyrotechnics show across the harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Thursday, Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, says the industry has also adopted new promotion tactics to attract tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see a lot of hotels and different eateries rolling out new ideas, like using the panda theme, putting up panda decorations, and introducing new dishes. These attract mainland tourists to come to Hong Kong to spend Christmas apart from just seeing the show, as the city has a more festive atmosphere than the mainland," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong pointed out that quite a number of mainland tourists stayed in the city for a couple more days, rather than heading home immediately after a day trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that hotels offering buffets benefited the most among all eateries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lau Hak-bun, the chief supervisor of The Kowloon Pearls, Precious Stones, Jade, Gold and Silver Ornament Merchants Association, told the same programme that business in his sector this Christmas was more or less the same as last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people flow this Christmas was much higher than last year's, more than a 10 percent increase. But this did not help much with our sales. The performance was almost the same as last year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the resumption of the multi-entry visa two weeks ago, the number of mainland customers continued to increase, and sales these two days are quite good. We expect a slight increase in business by New Year's Eve," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said he expects gold sales to improve before the Lunar New Year as people tend to buy gold accessories to prepare for the festival, despite the price of gold having increased by around 20 percent compared to early 2024.

    O'Sullivan to move to HK, hails city's snooker scene

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan, who recently obtained residency in Hong Kong, said he will try to ramp up his form ahead of a major tournament scheduled in Kai Tak in March next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The seven-time world champion became an SAR resident in October through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme. Fellow snooker star Judd Trump followed suit earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan explained what drove the decision during an exclusive interview with RTHK in Macau, where he's headlining an invitational tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always enjoyed playing in Hong Kong, with a fantastic venue and good promoters," O'Sullivan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Rocket", as he's often referred to, is also looking forward to the World Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Sports Park, the first snooker ranking event in the city in more than three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to play some more tournaments to be ready, I think. My aim is to play more tournaments in the new year … I need to maybe make a bit more of an effort," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 49-year-old Englishman said he'll consider "year by year" whether to wrap up his professional career.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he already revealed plans to set up a number of snooker clubs around the world, including in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody loves snooker, and everyone loves to watch snooker. Snooker is the hardest out of all the cue sports. It's very popular here in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think [Hong Kong] needs a good academy, good training centre for young players to come and learn and get good coaching, and help them develop their own game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed plans to relocate to the city, and is now looking for an apartment with a view of Victoria Harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Trump's decision to follow in his footsteps, O'Sullivan said it was "not out of surprise".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it makes sense since [Trump's] girlfriend is from Hong Kong. He likes being here more than the UK, it makes complete sense for him," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he will be open to collaboration, O'Sullivan gave a more reserved answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't really align myself with other players. I like to be my own boss, do my own thing. I think it's better if we both do our own career, our own stuff away from snooker," O'Sullivan replied.

 The government on Wednesday expressed strong dissatisfaction and opposition against slanderous remarks made by Western countries and the United States, following the SAR's decision to cancel the passports of seven national security suspects.
 <br>
  <br>
  Seven suspects wanted here, including former lawmakers Ted Hui and Dennis Kwok, have been stripped of their SAR passports, as announced by the authorities on Tuesday, and six more people living overseas were placed on the national security wanted list.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said it was necessary to take measures to strike a "strong blow" to combat and deter the acts of abscondment, and procure their return to face law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign government officials and politicians, as well as anti-China organisations, deliberately smeared and spread irresponsible remarks on the measures and actions taken by the SAR government in accordance with the law in an attempt to mislead the public," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, all specified measures including the cancellation of SAR passports and eligibility for application align with human rights requirements, and quite a number of countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada would also impose such measures on wanted criminals."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman said absconders should not think they could evade criminal liability by absconding from Hong Kong, and that they would be sanctioned by the law ultimately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, also expressed strong dissatisfaction to the remarks at a regular press conference in Beijing on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly disapprove and firmly reject countries which blatantly attack and smear Hong Kong police taking enforcement actions. The mentioned people absconded overseas, have long been engaged in interfering in Hong Kong affairs and supporting anti-China," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They attempted to interfere and undermine Hong Kong's development and social stability, seriously endangering national security and damaging Hong Kong's fundamental interests, crossing the bottom line of the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle."
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed that Hong Kong matters are purely China's internal affairs, and no external forces should intervene in the matters.

    Annual food festival opens at HKCEC in Wan Chai

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Food Festival kicked off at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Wednesday, with mixed feelings on business sentiment among vendors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event runs until Sunday with over 1,000 booths offering a variety of food and drinks, including wine, bakery goods, local snacks to New Year delicacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin Heung Lau, a famous Chinese restaurant located in Central, is one of the vendors. They put up neon signs at their booth and decorated it with their signature menu paper for dim sum.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The restaurant re-opened on April the 1st and we hope to use this chance to promote our business at the food festival. This is our first time participating, and we’re trying to bring dim sum and yum cha culture to the exhibition,” its representative said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One vendor from Taiwan said she wants to promote its handmade ginger and brown sugar tea to the locals, and that sales were looking good on the first day.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her brand has been kept away from Hong Kong exhibitions for years because of the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  But another vendor said people appeared to be spending less compared to previous years and that most big spenders were locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior couple said they spent HK$3,000 on everyday items, such as canned food, alcohol and rice.
  <br>
  <br>
  The products are a little bit cheaper than outside, but the main thing is to experience the atmosphere and to support the local economy, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Entry tickets for the exhibition are priced at HK$30 each. Children aged 3 or below, seniors aged 65 or above, as well as non-local tourists can enjoy free admission.

  <br>
  <br>
  Lee invited families from the community living room in Nam Cheong to join him and his wife at Government House for a Christmas party, making Christmas wreaths, drawing and writing cards, and decorating the Christmas tree.
  <br>

    Judd Trump 'much happier' playing as HK resident

<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker star Judd Trump said he is looking forward to playing in a major tournament at Kai Tak next March as a Hong Kong resident.
 <br>
  <br>
  For the first time in 35 years, the SAR will stage a ranking event as the World Snooker Tour announced earlier that the World Grand Prix will take place at the brand new Kai Tak Sports Park between March 4 and 9, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who just obtained a Hong Kong passport through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, was speaking to reporters on Wednesday ahead of a match in Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to inspire the younger generation in the city to take up snooker along with local stars Marco Fu and Ng On-yee.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope to really inspire the next generation because there are already so many younger players coming through in Hong Kong,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Marco Fu is doing such a good job to inspire, and in the women’s game, [we have] On-yee, I really hope that I can promote snooker to everyone in Hong Kong and make it as cool as possible, and get younger kids away from different sports and enjoy snooker,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he is open to promoting the sport in the city along with Ronnie O’Sullivan, who also became a Hong Kong resident two months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The snooker star also shared that he loved the vibrant life Hong Kong has to offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a fast-paced lifestyle, everyone is always on the move, and there is also so much to do, as you are so close to everyone and if you drive 15 minutes, you’re already at the beaches, somewhere more relaxing,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For me, it’s perfect for what I do, as sometimes I like to feel the hustle and bustle around everybody, and sometimes I want to get away and do more relaxing stuff,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he lives in the city for at least six months of the year, and that his girlfriend was a major reason why he decided to move to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the moment, I only spend time in the UK for tournaments and my priority is to be as happy as possible off the table. I’m much happier living in Hong Kong,” he said.

    Hong Kong to tap drone use in healthcare
   </title>
   <link>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784925_1_20241225111224.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has the potential to make use of drones in healthcare and draw experience from the mainland, according to an industry leader.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources say the Hospital Authority (HA) plans to test drone medication deliveries in rural parts of Hong Kong, like flying drones from Tseung Kwan O Hospital to Po Toi O Chuen, a village about 10 kilometres away, as well as from Northern District Hospital to nearby villages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA earlier said they were committed to the government's plan for a low-altitude economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy Yeung, chairman of the DNT FPV Drone Association Hong Kong, China, spoke on an RTHK radio programme on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has the potential for development, but in the beginning we might need to rely on existing mainland technology. We can adapt their well-developed system to fit our needs later on,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Each area has different application environments, networks, interference, and regulations. If we take cues from the mainland’s success, like field arrangement, work distribution, and problem-solving in real scenarios, it will make things easier for Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said it’s wise to start testing in less populated areas because it’s easier to demonstrate to the public how they work and help ease their worries about safety and privacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that drones weighing between 5 to 10 kilogrammes should be sufficient for delivering medications.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that ionospheric scintillation - which disrupted satellite signals and led to the cancellation of the drone show on October 1 - wouldn’t affect the deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung explained that a drones performance involves hundreds of drones and any slight deviation could result in collision, but that’s not the case for medication delivery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you're up in the air with a drone, a shift of five centimetres to one or two metres usually just results in slower speeds. Also, when planning routes, you would avoid crowded spots and won’t fly between buildings, so minor deviations aren’t a major issue,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same programme, Sai Kung District Councilor Christine Fong stressed that there’s a real need for drug delivery, noting that many elderly people in Po Toi O Chuen have to tackle a steep road whenever they go out, with the wait time for minibuses sometimes exceeding half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the fee for drone delivery should not exceed the HK$65 per prescription charged by HA for its current medication delivery service, and that subsidies should be granted to low income families.

    'Spending pattern shifting in Lan Kwai Fong'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A bar industry representative on Wednesday said the sector is confident in making a strong showing over the holiday period, with reservations through New Year’s Eve reaching over 80 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the director of the Lan Kwai Fong Association, Anthea Cheung, said business during Christmas Eve was better than last year, and that there's a noticeable change in spending pattern.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Lan Kwai Fong has always been a high-spending area. We still see customers are eager to spend, whether they’re from the mainland, local, or abroad. For example, those who book rooms show strong spending,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But this year, to appeal to a broader audience, we’ve rolled out more affordable packages, including all-you-can-eat deals, which weren’t common in Central restaurants before. Clearly, customer consumption habits are shifting.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung pointed out that the big spenders remain expats and foreigners, who account for 40 percent of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said she noticed more people with suitcases in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's quite rare to see people travelling with suitcases in Lan Kwai Fong because it’s mainly for catering and entertainment, not shopping,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We didn't interview them, but maybe it's because multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents have been brought back. Their suitcases weren't too big, so they might have just come for a meal or a drink, to experience the atmosphere without spending a night in Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung added that the industry can't rest on laurels and needs to continue to improve and aim to retain inbound travellers.

    Govt to do more to promote mediation: Paul Lam

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Wednesday said the government is setting an example by including mediation clauses in all future government contracts, in order to encourage private corporations to resolve disputes by mediation first.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK programme Overview Policy, he said the government is taking the lead in promoting the mediation culture in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to build a mediation culture. To build a culture, you have to be persuasive and to take a step forward to change the mindset and habit in the society,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Of course, I wouldn't say mediation will always be successful [in resolving disputes], but at least give it a try. If it doesn't work, you can try a different approach.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also said the government will promote the mediation culture to the public by launching the Pilot Scheme on Community Mediation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When people are encountering community disputes, they can sit down and discuss the problems first, instead of filing a lawsuit right away,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The justice chief said the scheme will be launched in several districts and the government will work with the local communities, so that the public can have a better understanding of mediation and have confidence in the system.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Large crowds flocked to the waterfront promenade along the West Kowloon Cultural District on Tuesday for a spectacular pyrotechnics show to mark Christmas Eve.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many people RTHK spoke to said they were extremely impressed with the 10-minute "Winter Harbourfront Pyrotechnics", which will be on for three consecutive nights from December 24 to 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eunice, a resident from Macau, said celebrating Christmas Eve in Hong Kong for the first time was a delightful experience, with the pyrotechnic show serving as an unexpected bonus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely impressed. It's just crazy to me. It's my first time witnessing an experience like this and I think it's great. I really like the excitement," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was this family in front of me and their little baby going 'wa' every single time and it just really made my day. It's the highlight of my day trip here in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman from Guangzhou said the show symbolised Hong Kong's prosperity, and wished it could be longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a group of children clad in Christmas attire enthusiastically awarded the show 20,000 points for its beauty, while saying they enjoyed spending time with each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said special traffic and transport arrangements are in place to cater for those enjoying the festivities, with MTR local lines and seven light rail lines operating overnight on Christmas Eve, and KMB also strengthening services on many routes.

 World snooker number one Judd Trump has become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  His move comes two months after another British superstar from the sport, Ronnie O'Sullivan, did the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video released by Hong Kong Talent Engage, the government's office to attract talent, Trump, 35, said he was looking forward to making new friends in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love just being around the hustle and bustle of people. For me I really enjoy the energy in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I love to be around people and I love to see people thrive and go about their business."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office quoted Trump as saying he loves everything about the SAR from the food, the people and the buildings, and these are what inspired him to be in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  A world snooker champion in 2019, Trump has won 30 major titles so far during his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local and British media earlier reported that Trump has been dating local show host and former figure skater Maisy Ma and that they spend time in both Hong Kong and Dubai.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmakers Ted Hui and Dennis Kwok are among seven national security suspects who have their SAR passports cancelled as the government levied a fresh round of sanctions against them.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hui and Kwok, along with Kevin Yam, Yuan Gong-yi, Anna Kwok, Joey Siu and Frances Hui – who are all living overseas – were earlier placed on a wanted list, with the authorities offering rewards of HK$1 million each for information that leads to their arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang told a press conference on Tuesday that the public is banned from providing the absconders with money, handling their funds, engaging in property transactions or entering into commercial partnerships with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Kwok, Yam and Yuan also had their professional qualifications or company directorships in Hong Kong temporarily stripped.
  <br>
  <br>
  The security minister added that the authorities have initiated court proceedings to seize the money raised by Ted Hui on online platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're processing with the confiscation of the crime proceeds against Hui, and the amount is around HK$800,000," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the passport cancellations are useful because the group won't be able to travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the authorities have placed six more people living overseas on the national security wanted list, offering rewards of HK$1 million each for information leading to their arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are scholar Chung Kim-wah, former district councillor Carmen Lau, former actor Joseph Tay, and activists Tony Chung, Victor Ho and Chloe Cheung.
  <br>
  <br>
  National security police said they're suspected of inciting secession on social media, calling for sanctions against Hong Kong and mainland officials, colluding with foreign forces, and promoting a so-called referendum to achieve self-determination.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy police commissioner on national security, Andrew Kan, said officers are freezing their bank accounts, and that the public should not give them any money on online platforms.

    Interest in fostering rises after allowance increased

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Social Welfare Department on Tuesday said there's been a sharp increase in the number of people applying to become foster carers since a monthly allowance was more than doubled to around HK$11,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  The payment was increased in April, while those providing emergency care saw their allowance roughly double to HK$13,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsung Ka-yee, officer in charge at the department's central foster care unit, told an RTHK programme that there are now more than 1,000 foster families in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the incentive payments were increased on April 1 this year, the number of enquiries we've received has surged by more than 35 percent compared to last year," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for the actual number of applicants we're processing, because some enquiries might not lead to an actual application, we're now handling around 20 percent more applications than a year ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carrie Kong, chief supervisor for foster care services at the Hong Kong Christian Service, said carers welcome the increased allowance as it gives them a sense of recognition for their work.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she told the same programme that it still takes time to place children in a new home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though there are more foster families, and it's become easier for us to look for suitable families to match with the children's needs, this doesn't mean that children in need can be admitted within a short period of time, because matching a child with a family involves many factors," she said.

    'Safety education must start from young age'

<img alt="Fay Siu says there should also be jail terms, and not just fines, for offenders in some serious cases. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784736_1_20241223221832.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims on Monday called for more safety education as it revealed a concerning trend in workplace fatalities and sudden deaths in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group reported 76 fatal workplace accidents across all sectors as of Monday this year, with nearly half registered in the construction industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty cases were classified as "sudden death at work", which were double the total figure from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Safety awareness is lacking not only in the industry but also in Hong Kong society as a whole," said Venus Cheuk, an organiser from the association.
  <br>
  <br>
  She told RTHK that pre-employment training alone is insufficient to address the issue, adding that safety education should begin from childhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because since childhood, we have had a deficit in safety education, which naturally hindered the development of a safety mindset," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's chief executive, Fay Siu, felt that the penalties meted out to some employers convicted of breaching the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance lacked deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said apart from fines, there should also be jail terms for offenders in some serious cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the association said six deaths or serious industrial accidents occurred during the construction of the airport's third runway system, with some taking place at night.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Airport Authority said it has always adhered to the highest construction safety standards, adding that the accident rate for the third runway system project was 6.41 per thousand workers, much lower than the industry average.

<img alt="The government says the Airport Authority has acknowledged procedural failures in reporting and investigation. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784730_1_20241223212303.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has called on the Airport Authority to improve its reporting mechanism and enhance staff training, after the body did not immediately report an incident involving the automated people mover system last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Back in November 2023, a girl was suspected to have stumbled and fallen into the gap between the platform and the train. She was helped to safety by passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the incident only came to light 11 months later in October this year, with the government saying it was not notified.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority was then ordered to submit a report within one month.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Monday, the government said the authority acknowledged procedural failures in reporting and investigation, but added it found no evidence of a cover-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the the authority blamed a "lack of alertness in reporting and communication among the frontline staff", and as a result the incident was not "properly recorded" back then.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disciplinary actions have since been taken against the staff involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government noted that airport officials have pledged to take steps to address the situation. These include organising training sessions to strengthen the incident notification mechanism, and enhancing the CCTV system at the platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department also confirmed that the people mover system is safe in both its design and operation.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Catholic leader Stephen Chow has called on people to stay hopeful for the future in his Christmas message.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cardinal Chow said amid the slower-than-expected recovery of the global and local economies, wars and geopolitical tensions, people should continue to have faith - and be extra supportive to young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Christmas and the New Year are a time for hope, love, peace and dreams. Without hope and dreams there will be no future, especially for our young people. We need to walk alongside them and empower their creative hope and dreams," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cardinal added everyone can step up to provide love and hope, especially to those who are going through tough times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can think of those who are struggling in war zones with seemingly endless torment, displaced persons and refugees looking for a dignified future, prisoners waiting for a new life, married couples who cannot see a sufficiently stable future for childbearing, young people who fail to identify convincing reasons to envisage a hopeful future, the elderly who are lonely and abandoned, and those who are sick and lonely in hospitals," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Similarly, the Archbishop of Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, Andrew Chan, called for forgiveness, peace, reconciliation and service.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know how easy it is to be blinded and distracted by the visible wealth around us, but it is even easier to be blinded by the invisible power of this world. It is easy to say that with power, comes responsibility, but far too often we see people taking power and using it without holding back," he said in a video message.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is nothing more powerful than God, and what he does with that ultimate power is to love and forgive."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Monday said a new contactless channel at the Chung Ying Street checkpoint in Sha Tau Kok makes it easier for people to access the area and demonstrates Hong Kong's innovative technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  Facial recognition technology allows people with valid Closed Area Permits to enter and exit Chung Ying Street without stopping to show their passes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an opening ceremony, Chan said he believes the revamped checkpoint also offers a photo opportunity for visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through this pilot scheme, we hope to replace manual checks with innovative technology – making checkpoint access easier for people, increasing passenger capacity, and showcasing Hong Kong's digital capabilities as an international hub," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reprovisioned checkpoint also provides tourists with a new photo spot."
  <br>
  <br>
  Richard, an Ap Chau resident who buy groceries in Chung Ying Street every week, said the technology makes his life easier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's instant. I'm very impressed. Very advanced progress," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HK$50 million checkpoint features nostalgic elements including grey bricks, white pillars and wooden benches inspired by old railway stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edward Wong, a project director from the Architectural Services Department, said he hopes the building will attract tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to get the memory of the old station that we have in the Sha Tau Kok spur line and also we get the memory of the old station," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have some characteristics, for example rusty rail lines, so we are creating some rusty walls here. So we have to show that we can have some hotspots for the tourists to take photos here."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man was on Monday sentenced to four years and a month behind bars for his role in the Yuen Long clashes in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang Ka-man, a businessman, was found guilty last month of rioting and conspiracy to wounding with intent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In sentencing, deputy District Court judge Amy Chan said the defendant was involved in the violence around Yuen Long MTR Station on July 21, 2019, as video footage showed he held a rattan stick and stood at the front of a 100-strong group dressed in white.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said the group had planned their attack as many of them were armed, which showed they were expecting the arrival of a rival group dressed in black.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan described the assault as effecting hatred, bullying, intimidation and silencing, saying the white-shirted group should have called the police instead of, as she put it, enforcing the law themselves or using violence to express dissatisfaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge added that while there was no evidence showing that Tang had caused injuries to those dressed in black, he provided help to others dressed in white and was at the scene to encourage others to take part in the rioting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan reduced the defendant's jail term by five months, saying he had agreed during trial that a riot had taken place and had been involved in charity.

    'Handle Real Madrid fan complaints individually'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on organisers of a meet-and-greet session with former Real Madrid stars to address complaints about last week's event individually.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, fans complained that they had paid HK$6,880 to meet the veteran players but were unable to get their autographs or take photos with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said it has received 16 complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incident this time was special and has to be addressed in a more individual and targeted manner, because every case is different," the watchdog's chief executive, Gilly Wong, said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it was a big case involving lots of people, it might have to be handled in a standard manner. But here, each complainant's case can be addressed separately, and they can try to coordinate with the organisers."
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Wong told RTHK that by the time he was allowed into the meet-and-greet session, some of the players had already left.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he wasn't impressed with the organisers' efforts to make up for the disappointment, including the offer of a group photo before Real's game against Barcelona at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're obviously dissatisfied. Actually the arrangement just kept getting worse. The arrangement of a group photo was already not particularly good, and they couldn't even arrange a new autograph session afterwards. The incident made us really sad," he said, adding that he wants a full refund.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event organisers have apologised, explaining that players left early to prepare for the match. A WhatsApp hotline has been set up for those unhappy with the arrangements.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Monday said it has issued two fixed penalty tickets and 33 written warnings to premises that have violated the ban on disposable plastic products since a grace period for the new law ended about two months ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Restaurants are prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hotels are also banned from freely distributing bathroom items made of plastic, including plastic-handled toothbrushes, plastic-packed toothpaste and shower caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other prohibited products include cotton buds, umbrella bags and glow sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EPD said it received 62 complaints and reports about non-compliance and in 33 cases no action was taken to rectify problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EPD has issued written warnings requiring the persons-in-charge to make improvements within 10 working days; otherwise, a fixed penalty notice will be issued," a department spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two catering premises were found to be persistently violating the rules and were each issued a fixed penalty ticket of HK$2,000, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having reviewed the data in these two months after the adaptation period, most of the non-compliance had been rectified within a short period of time, and only two cases with repeated non-compliance records required the issuance of fixed penalty notices at present," the spokesman said.

    Some minor works could be exempted in future: Linn

<img alt="Bernadette Linn says items that could be exempted in future include enclosed balconies as well as flagpoles that are relatively small in size.  File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784583_1_20241222172519.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development minister Bernadette Linn said she expects at least a third of the 36,000 illegal housing structures subject to removal orders to be exempted, if legal amendments to the Buildings Ordinance are passed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials are proposing to allow certain unauthorised minor works to be kept if they have been checked and proven safe by approved professionals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan is to let officials focus on taking enforcement action against serious violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme on Sunday, Linn said the checking fee by authorised experts should cost several thousand dollars on average.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government is planning to give homeowners a grace period of three years – after the new laws are passed – to complete the inspection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Buildings Department is conducting an analysis on this. It's possible that a third or half of these outstanding removal orders involve minor illegal structures," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That means that at least 10,000 of these orders could be subject to checks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said items that could be exempted in future include enclosed balconies as well as flagpoles that are relatively small in size.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legal amendments also include tougher penalties for serious and major illegal structures, as well as a lower prosecution threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development chief added that under the proposed new rules, people who inherit unauthorised works from the previous owner could still be prosecuted, if they didn't remove them within a certain period of time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said this means that going forward, homebuyers should pay greater attention and exercise more caution when making a purchase.
  <br>
  <br>
  A two-month public consultation on the proposal is due to begin later this month, and the amendment bill could be tabled to the legislature in the first half of 2026.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police announced on Sunday that they have arrested and charged a 46-year-old man on suspicion of burglary and attempted burglary in connection with a string of cases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Lau Wing-lam said the suspect is believed to have broken into 11 kindergartens, a construction site and an office in New Territories and Kowloon between May and this month, taking away cash and electronic gadgets worth over HK$230,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our investigation found that the man had acted alone. He pried open door locks or window frames using hard objects during the early hours of the day, and ransacked the place to steal cash and some electronic gadgets, such as computers, phones, and cameras," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The schools reported losses of more than HK$180,000 between them -- including HK$150,000 in cash -- while the construction site and office lost items worth about HK$43,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they’ve been able to recover some of those items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man is due to appear at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector representative on Sunday said the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents has given restaurants a much-needed boost over winter solstice.
 <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said most eateries did “quite well” on Saturday night, with the sector recording nearly HK$400 million in sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Especially for Chinese restaurants, they can do two rounds of business, this has been quite good. Compared to last year, business has grown by about eight percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Some hotspots, like Tsim Sha Tsui, Causeway Bay and some other areas, were crowded with people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also revealed that he's expecting a 10 percent growth in sales over the Christmas and New Year period, with an anticipated surge in visitors from Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong can provide the kind of atmosphere for Christmas. When we see that all the shopping malls and even the streets [are] filled with Christmas atmosphere, then people from the mainland would rather come to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The catering representative said he hopes travellers can stay in the SAR for a longer period of time to further boost the local economy.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that the government will roll out more innovative products, systems and cross-border cooperation to boost the capacity and liquidity of the SAR's financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was responding to comments from President Xi Jinping that both Hong Kong and Macau need to continue to expand global connections and enhance their attractiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi made the remarks when he attended the ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Macau SAR on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other things, the President also said the SARs have to accelerate their integration into the country's development plan, and play an even better connecting role in the new development paradigm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said Hong Kong therefore needs to promote more innovation, such as allowing the mainland to connect with more new emerging markets, while strengthening cooperation with traditional markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The higher liquidity and capacity of the Hong Kong market can better satisfy the fundraising needs of firms and organisations amid the geo-political situation and technological advancement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief noted that while the country is facing challenges such as protectionism and unilateralism, it remains unwavering in promoting policies for high-level bilateral opening up.
  <br>
  <br>
  To this end, Chan said Hong Kong -- as "a super-connector and super value-adder" -- will be even more proactive in encouraging multilateral exchanges and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong will join hands with what he called other brother cities in the Greater Bay Area to go on roadshows and seek foreign investment, and create more win-win business opportunities.

    Airport crowded as people leave HK for Christmas

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong International Airport said on Sunday that it is stepping up services as people begin to fly out for the Christmas break.
 <br>
  <br>
  Long queues snaked around check-in counters at Chek Lap Kok, with many travellers saying they’re excited to take a break.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman, surnamed Koo, told RTHK she’s off to Thailand for a warm Christmas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Five of us are joining a meditation camp there, then I'll visit Bangkok and Pattaya for six days. There's not much to do in Hong Kong. The atmosphere here isn't too good because people tend to go home early," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we go out to Mongkok, I go home when it starts turning dark, probably because of the habits we picked up during the pandemic. But when we're away from the city, we stay up later because the atmosphere is better.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kwok family, meanwhile, said they’re looking forward to a white Christmas in Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to Osaka! We're so happy! It's so much fun there - and we're going to Universal Studios Japan!" the son said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We bought the tickets way ahead, and we want our kids to experience Christmas somewhere different. If it snows, our kids will be able to look at the natural scenery," the father added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority is advising people to travel to the airport via public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had said earlier that it’s expecting to handle around 200,000 passengers daily over the Christmas period, reaching pre-pandemic levels.

 Organisers of an exhibition football match between former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars have issued an apology, after arrangements for a meet-and-greet session with veteran players reportedly left some fans disappointed.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Real Madrid fans complained they paid HK$6,880 to meet the La Liga legends but were unable to get their autographs and take photos with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to organisers, fans could purchase an "experience set" that included a ticket to the star-studded match at Hong Kong Stadium, an autograph session with either one of the teams in the morning, and other merchandise items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Madrid Hong Kong Fans Club said "an unpleasant incident" happened at the meeting and had notified the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club also accused the organisers of not following through with their remedial measures such as arranging for a group photo to be taken before the match, and that fans were unable to hand their own memorabilia directly to the players for a signature.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an apology on Saturday, organisers said they're keeping in close contact with the fans club and those affected to "properly handle relevant matters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the issue that arose in [Friday's] signing event, we have done our best to deal with it immediately and are proactively working out solutions with affected fans and related parties," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are aware that this incident has aroused public attention, and we deeply apologise for the inconvenience and confusion caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also vowed to make better arrangements to avoid similar situations from happening again.

    Winter solstice drives Hongkongers to spend more

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers appeared to be more generous with their spending as they prepared for winter solstice gatherings on Saturday, but wet market stall-holders remained cautious about their business.
 <br>
  <br>
  The day, in Chinese tradition, is typically celebrated with family, when people gather for a meal at home or at a restaurant.
  <br>
  <br>
  People at wet markets were looking to spend a bit more than usual, with some opting to shop for hot pot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I plan to spend around HK$1,000... I think I should stay home to celebrate during holidays," said shopper Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another shopper, surnamed Cheung, said he was willing to almost double his usual spending of HK$300 and had a budget of more than HK$500.
  <br>
  <br>
  But vendors at wet markets were not hoping for a jump in business on the festive day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There isn't much of a difference nowadays whether it's a holiday or not... There are fewer large families and fewer people are buying ingredients at the market," said merchant Yeung. "Business has gotten worse one year after the other."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Business has been a bit quieter than before... Although there were fewer people, some still came to the wet market to shop because they know it's winter solstice," said another stall owner.

    'Voluntary reporting of illegal structure not amnesty'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn said on Saturday that a proposal to bring back the mechanism for voluntary reporting of unauthorised building works in village houses in the New Territories doesn't equate to granting them amnesty.
 <br>
  <br>
  The previous reporting period lasted for eight months in 2012.
  <br>
  <br>
  Property owners who reported unauthorised building works that were built on or before June 28, 2011 and imposed less risk didn’t have to fix them immediately, but had to conduct regular safety inspections every five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said that the government doesn’t have enough staff to deal with all the cases at present, but stressed that the scheme does not mean property owners don't need to do anything.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not like we won’t prosecute you for the unauthorised works even if you have find someone to conduct regular inspections,” she said on an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said it may take until 2030 for officials to complete other more urgent matters in urban areas, and then they'll look at how to handle the village house situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development minister noted that the Buildings Department has so far checked  roughly 60,000 village houses, out of about 99,000, and found that around half had unauthorised building work.
  <br>
  <br>
  There could be over 100,000 unauthorised building works among all village houses in total, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Linn reiterated plans to toughen fines for unauthorised building works isn’t about punishing people, but about getting them to take the issue seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government hopes to amend the Buildings Ordinance, including raising the maximum fine for unauthorised building works from HK$400,000 to HK$2 million, alongside the existing risk of a two-year prison term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also proposing a fixed penalty of HK$6,000 for owners who ignore statutory building inspection notices, which apply to premises that are 30 years old or more.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government's intention is not to punish our property owners or citizens. What we hope is that through our legislation, we can establish rigorous provisions that encourage and urge everyone to comply with the law,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have many ageing buildings. We want to prompt everyone to take the requirement for building inspections seriously."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will seek input from the public and professional groups when the two-month consultation on the proposal begins later this month.

    Paediatrician warns of 'severe' flu season

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician on Saturday has urged the public not to lower their guard this flu season, urging Hongkongers to get vaccinated for what could be a severe winter flu season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mike Kwan, from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, said infection numbers are expected to spike in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said the SAR's flu season might be comparable to Australia's experience earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just looking back [at] Australia, the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season in fact was quite severe. So I expect, in the Northern Hemisphere this winter, our flu season will still be quite severe," Kwan said after appearing on a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is why we are advocating the flu vaccination to all our citizens. The severity of flu infections in our community really depends on the percentage of our vaccinations, what we regard as herd immunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said the vaccination rate among children aged six months to three years was relatively low.

    Pandas proving huge drawcard at Ocean Park: chairman

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of Ocean Park said on Saturday that thousands of visitors have flocked daily to see An An and Ke Ke, the pair of pandas gifted by the central government, since their public debut earlier this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Pong also told a Commercial Radio Programme that he's optimistic that December visitor numbers will show a significant increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We've noticed more visitors from Southeast Asia, and it's great to see people from Europe and the US coming back too. That's why we are expecting good results this month,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said tourists from India and the Philippines are surging as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tourists from India are topping the charts this year, with a fourfold increase for 2023-2024. Well, the base numbers might be low, but the growth from India and the Philippines is still quite impressive,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many local families are also expected to visit the theme park over the weekend and also the upcoming Christmas and New Year holidays, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park posted a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June even though visitor numbers and revenue reached five-year high.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said 30 percent of the park’s spending is earmarked for conservation and education work, which he described as “hard to measure in monetary terms.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the park understands the importance of achieving break-even and will work hard to broaden its income sources, including launching panda-themed products and attracting new visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed hope of getting longer term government subsidies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, Ocean Park receives government funding of HK$280 million each year to cover its expenditure on conservation and education work. But this is scheduled to end in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Pong noted experts estimated the twin panda cubs will be safe and ready to meet the public when they turn six months old, which will be around February.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said it might be tricky to have the twins and their parents, Ying Ying and Le Le, appear together in one venue, noting the park needs to monitor how they interact and their safety is the park's priority.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials said they were satisfied with the inaugural concert that was being held at the Kai Tak Arena on Friday, saying it had generally met the government's expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show was aimed at testing the venue’s readiness for hosting mega events and its possible impact on the surrounding neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,200 ticket holders attended the Chill Thai Music Festival, which featured local boy band Mirror, girl group Collar and various Thai performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The performance kicked off at around 6.50pm -- 20 minutes behind schedule -- and ended at 10.45pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spectator surnamed Wong said while the acoustic system wasn’t perfect, instructions were clear and staff were helpful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be honest, since it's the first time, there's room for improvement. I'd give it 50 marks," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything was clear and plenty of people were helping out. When we went in, people voluntarily helped us check our tickets and find our seats. There were also many signboards, and this place was easy to find."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We needed to wear Airpods to protect our ears because the music was too loud," another spectator, surnamed Chan, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi -- who attended the test event with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law and Acting Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk -- said authorities were generally happy with how things went.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The show today slightly overran, but we have systems and mechanisms in place to handle such situations, including communication protocols with public transport operators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that various audio and visual setups will continue to be fine-tuned to improve overall spectator experience.

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 13 million passenger trips in and out of Hong Kong will take place over the Christmas and New Year holidays with the majority via land borders, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said about 11 million trips will likely be made through land boundary control points from Saturday to New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of departures via land is estimated to peak at 595,000 on Christmas Day and the inbound figure is likely to reach a high of 626,000 on December 29, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Border control points at Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau and Shenzhen Bay are expected to be busy, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To cope with the anticipated heavy traffic during the festive period, the [Immigration Department] has minimised leave for frontline officers for flexible deployment and operation of extra clearance counters and kiosks," the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additional security guards will also be deployed to provide crowd management support."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said further details will be announced "as soon as possible" regarding government requests to extend the service hours of two border checkpoints on New Year's Eve.

 Officials on Friday said 833 bankruptcy applications were made in November, slightly lower than the 877 petitions logged in October.

  November's figure, released by the Official Receiver’s Office, was up 2.3 percent from a year before.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Friday said it will beef up manpower and bed capacity to guard against a potential surge in patients during the upcoming holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) reported a mild increase in both Covid and influenza cases, with the numbers expected to rise further in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA said it will activate special measures for peak periods from Saturday, including reducing non-urgent hospital admissions and boosting manpower in public hospitals by 10 to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Larry Lee, a chief manager with the authority, told a press conference that he's confident public hospitals have enough capacity to cope with a surge in demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important bit of it is to increase the bed turnover, including making use of our command centre and the day centre, so that we can aim our patients not lasting too long in our hospitals so that we can cater more emergency admissions," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to experience, our measures have improved and enhanced our capability to cope with the increased demand. So if the situations and the service activity will be similar to last year, I think we can cope with it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the HA will also relaunch a special refund arrangement at accident and emergency departments to ease the pressure on services. Patients who don't want to wait any longer to be seen can apply for a refund of the HK$180 fee within 24 hours of registration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP, meanwhile, appealed to high-risk individuals to get flu vaccines to protect themselves.

    Police arrest 39 over 'staged traffic accidents'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty-nine people were arrested this week on suspicion of staging traffic accidents to try to defraud the government out of money granted to injured victims, police said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspects, aged between 19 and 48, are suspected of making false claims worth a total of HK$2 million in relation to 33 allegedly fake accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Earlier this year, an internal audit by the Social Welfare Department found fraudsters using falsified documents to apply for the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme," Senior Inspector Lam Tsz-lim said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police investigations found some of these claims were linked to an organisation which orchestrates staged traffic accidents. One such incident involved 13 people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam noted that 275 people were arrested last month over suspicious claims under the scheme worth a total of HK$14 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police said money was not paid out in relation to most of the suspicious claims connected to the latest arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department said it verifies every application stringently and is carrying out more random checks on medical certificates submitted by applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If false medical information, fraudulence or other criminal elements are suspected, the SWD will refer the case to the police for investigation and recover the overpaid assistance payments from the relevant applicants," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department also warned that people convicted of providing false information to obtain money from the accident victims scheme risk a jail term of up to 14 years.

    Smart system to take effect at Ting Kau Bridge
   </title>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Friday said it will implement a smart highway system at Ting Kau Bridge by the end of this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the system has the ability to detect traffic accidents, and make appropriate arrangements to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Assistant Commissioner for Transport (Strategic Studies) Leung Sai-ho said the Automatic Incident Detection System can notify staff at the Tsing Ma Control Area in 10 seconds if it notices any abnormalities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In cases in which a car suddenly stops moving, or slows down, or drives in the opposite direction, or objects fall on to the road, the system can analyse footage and deduce that a traffic incident has happened and tell our staff to act," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we do not have such systems, we will have to detect incidents through the human eye, which would take minutes," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said on-site staff may open up the hard shoulder of Ting Kau Bridge southbound to ease traffic flow, along with lane control signals and variable message signs to allow vehicles to pass by.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added message boards have already been installed along the road, aiming to provide real-time information to drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system will be in place on December 29 for a one-month trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said a mid-term review would be conducted in around six months if the scheme runs smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said the department would analyse traffic data collected and fine tune its implementation of the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wesley Wan, honorary life president of the Hong Kong Automobile Association, told RTHK that the city's drivers are familiar with having variable message boards on highways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [drivers] are already used to the notice board and the electronic notice on the highway. But I've noticed many times the government puts on some road safety message instead of the road information on the spot. They should inform motorists of the real-time information on the highway instead of just a road safety message," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wan also said the one-month trial period may be too short for data to be collected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the government] spent a lot of time to install the system for this trial. So my question is, why just a one month trial? If we are lucky that there's no accident happening during this month, then we'll have no data. So I think the trial, with all this preparation work, the trial should be longer," he said.
