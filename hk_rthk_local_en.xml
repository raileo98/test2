<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent in 2024, officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure matched government forecasts, but was down from the 3.2 percent growth recorded in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed a relatively faster pace of growth in the last quarter of 2024 – at 2.4 percent year-on-year – compared to 1.9 percent in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, a government spokesperson said the economy is expected to register further growth in 2025, despite heightened uncertainties in the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said while US "protectionist policies" could affect Hong Kong's exports, supportive measures from Beijing will help offset some of the impact and the authorities will continue to take various measures to spur growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Terence Chong, an economics professor at Chinese University, said the city's latest growth was partially driven by stimulus measures from Beijing last September, as well as supportive policies in Chief Executive John Lee's Policy Address last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fourth quarter performance was actually much better than the third quarter's, basically it was driven by the exports of services and also by the government expenditure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if you look at the consumption and also investment, they dropped."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said falling retail sales are among the most concerning components weighing on the SAR's growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, we may [also] expect some reductions in the export sectors, because of the trade tensions between the US and other economies like China," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said he expects Hong Kong's annual economic growth to swing between two and four percent in the coming year, as a declining property sector gradually stabilises due to interest rate cuts boosting transaction volumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say that the property markets have reached the bottom and the sector will bounce back in the first half of 2025," he said, adding that the city's stock markets are also picking up steam.

    Retail sales drop for 10th consecutive month

<img alt="A government spokesman says retail sales declined further in December, partly due to more Hong Kong residents travelling abroad during the holidays. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790100_1_20250203170154.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales dropped 9.7 percent in December year-on-year, marking the 10th consecutive month of declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to figures from the Census and Statistics Department released on Monday, the value of total retail sales in December was estimated at HK$32.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decrease followed a revised 7.3 percent fall in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw a sharp decline of 36.3 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 22 percent fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said retail sales declined further in December, partly due to more Hong Kong residents travelling abroad during the holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the provisional data showed retail sales for the whole of 2024 decreased by 7.3 percent when compared with the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it said the retail sector would benefit due to various measures introduced by the central government and proactive efforts by the SAR authorities to promote tourism, boost market sentiment and increase employment earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bond Law, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, said while the sector is expecting a continuous decline in business for January and February, there is some cause for optimism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is hope for the increased business from mainland tourists, especially with the resumption of the multiple-entry individual visit scheme for Shenzhen residents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Members are observing changes in tourist foot traffic, spending patterns and basket sizes. While foot traffic may increase, purchasing power remains weak and we need time to see the foot effects."

    'Prosecutions not the aim of housing abuse offence'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Monday that a plan to criminalise serious abuse of public housing  isn't about prosecuting people or getting them out of their homes, but ensuring the proper use of public resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under proposed legal changes, people deemed to have seriously abused their tenancy, such as subletting their flat or using it for commercial purposes, would risk a prison term of up to 12 months and a fine as high as HK$500,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said if all goes smoothly, officials plan to table the relevant bill to the legislature in the next quarter, with a view to the law coming into effect in the second quarter of next year at the earliest.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco housing panel meeting, she told lawmakers that tenants would be allowed to work from home, as long as business activities don't take place inside the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many people nowadays work from home. Also, many people are interested in making some handicrafts and they sell them somewhere else, instead of using the flat for commercial purposes. All these will be allowed," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said tenants won't be allowed to "run the flat like a tuition centre or a gym room" with many people going in and out or price lists available, even if they also live in the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  She called on tenants to exercise caution if they use the address for business registration purposes, because it might raise suspicions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed that the authorities will use common sense when they handle breaches of the rules.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of the annual Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon say they have attracted a vibrant crowd of international runners this year, with many elite athletes expected to be in attendance.
 <br>
  <br>
  74,000 runners are set to participate this Sunday, including over 15,000 international athletes from 101 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will also be 14 male and 10 female elite runners joining, primarily from Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Ng, executive director of Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, said there is much to look forward to at this year's event, including pre-marathon activities at Kai Tak Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-day expo kicks off on Wednesday, featuring more than 40 booths filled with games and photo opportunities, with the aim of attracting over 120,000 visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The basic function of the marathon expo would be for the runners to collect their runner's packs. Apart from that, we would like the runners as well as the public to experience the marathon atmosphere at the marathon expo," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can enjoy the booths from the sponsors, from the Hong Kong AAA or even from our beneficiaries in the marathon charity programme to learn more about the marathon history and what our beneficiaries are doing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The full and half marathons will start on Nathan Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, while the 10-kilometre race will begin at the Island Eastern Corridor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the 10-kilometre wheelchair race, wheelchair trial, and Leaders Cup will commence at Wan Chai Sports Ground, with all events finishing at Victoria Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Road closures will begin in phases starting from 11.30pm on Saturday and all the roads closed are expected to reopen by 2pm on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The full and half marathon race routes will lead to extensive temporary road closures in the Yau Tsim Mong area, including sections of Nathan Road and Argyle Street. The roads affected are expected to be open again by around 10.30am, depending on race progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the full marathon will utilise the Kowloon-bound carriageways of the Cheung Tsing Highway and related tunnels, resulting in vehicle diversions that may cause traffic congestion near North Lantau Highway and the Tsing Ma Bridge, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Public transport services will also face significant adjustments and the public are advised to travel by MTR.

    Regulator calls for review after tour guide's death

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Travel Industry Authority (TIA) said on Monday it was high time for the sector to consider whether it is necessary for tour guides to stand and talk on a moving coach.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after a guide was thrown out of a vehicle and died in a crash in Shanghai last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's executive director, Annie Fonda, said authorities there were still investigating, and the TIA would keep in contact with them to see what happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said agencies should study whether tour guides should be wearing their seat belts at all times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this incident, I think the trade can share their views about whether it's really necessary for tour guides to stand on a [moving] coach and speak to tour members," Fonda said on Commercial Radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Safety belts are important. Say, on airplanes, flight attendants can put on their seat belts while seated as they face passengers. These are things we can study."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added the guide was a freelancer and his company, Miramar Travel, had bought work insurance for his trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, unionist Lam Chi-ting agreed the sector could study fitting standing-room seat belts for tour guides.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the director of the Tourism Industry Employees' General Union said on RTHK that it's unavoidable that guides have to move around the vehicle, such as collecting travel documents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said he is cautiously optimistic about the city's stock market performance in the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  At an opening ceremony as the bourse began its first trading session of the new year, Chan noted that stocks saw their best performance in seven years during the Year of the Dragon, with the benchmark index rising more than 28 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said he has consulted several popular artificial intelligence large language models on the SAR's outlook for the coming 12 months and all suggested the markets will be "flexible, smooth and prosperous", despite external challenges including from geopolitics and trade tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the market outlook for the Year of the Snake, I am cautiously optimistic and happy to see a better performance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the strong support from the country, along with the cooperation between the SAR government, regulators, and the industry, we can actively and flexibly respond to challenges, seize opportunities and explore new ideas and measures to further enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of the city's listing platform, while pushing the city's finance industry to new heights," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Chan, chairman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) Carlson Tong said officials will continue to roll out new financial products, and will carry out reforms to woo investors and global enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite ongoing challenges, I'm optimistic about the coming year with the planned new product launches, multi-year platforms development, market reforms, and expansion of our international networks," Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year also marks the 25th anniversary of the HKEX, underscoring our commitment to innovation and growth," he added.

    Reusable cup service needed at Kai Tak: Greenpeace

<img alt="Over 12,000 disposable items were distributed at the Lunar New Year Cup. Photo courtesy of Greenpeace" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790072_1_20250203172056.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A green group on Monday called on the government to build a reusable cup system at Kai Tak Sports Arena to reduce waste created at mega events.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after Greenpeace conducted a study during the Lunar New Year Cup that attracted some 20,000 people at Hong Kong Stadium on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They reviewed how many items of disposable cutlery and containers were given out among the five food vendors operating at the 16 shops which were open 45 minutes before the match started and during the intermission period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 12,000 disposable items were distributed during these time periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We used this data to amplify and estimate the number of disposable items that would be distributed by the Kai Tak sports centre in the coming year. We found that if there is a 100 percent occupancy rate [of 50,000 people] at 40 sports events yearly, there would be [more than] one million disposable items distributed to the audience,” said campaign officer Leanne Tam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam said the predictions did not include disposable paper cups provided at the 20 water fountains during previous trial events.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group urged the administration to allocate HK$10 million to develop a reusable cup service in which spectators can return the cup after events for washing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam said such services are not new to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the 2019 Rugby Sevens, Hong Kong tried to implement the reusable cup service. Greenpeace has also implemented a community programme to provide reusable cups to cafes two years ago, and we have successfully saved over 10,000 cups with 50 cafes,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added the government should take the lead in waste reduction and provide reusable cups for stores at the venue, so spectators can choose more environmentally friendly options.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung was on Monday sentenced to two years and 10 months in prison for conspiracy to defraud, over HK$42 million in transactions linked to a listed company.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court earlier convicted Chim, who was the largest shareholder of Asia Resources, and his son Ricky, who was the chairman, of conspiring with mainland businessman Ma Zhonghong to defraud the company, its board and shareholders between July 2013 and November 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case involved the issuance of convertible notes to increase the company's share capital while concealing a secret "shell company" agreement. Ma had agreed to pay the ex-lawmaker HK$210 million for 70 to 75 percent of Asia Resources' issued shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  The younger Chim was jailed for three years and one month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Poe-lai, a businesswoman and an associate of Ma, was convicted of money laundering in connection with the case and was jailed for two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passing sentence, judge Ernest Lin said Chim Pui-chung and his son not only harmed the interests of individual investors, but also hurt the SAR’s reputation as an international finance centre and shook investor confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said the starting point for the the former legislator's prison term was set at four years, and in reducing this to 34 months he had taken into account the defendant's old age and previous contributions to society, but also the damage he had caused.

    Hospital unveils 3D printed models to aid surgeons

<img alt="Researchers like Dr Victor Chan, right, are looking at creating more models to help surgeons practise different procedures. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790058_1_20250203120239.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eastern Hospital has introduced its latest 3D printed model of newborn babies' lungs to help doctors practise surgical intervention to treat pneumothorax, a condition when air accumulates in the pleural cavity which can collapse the lung and cause problems with heartbeat and breathing, in some cases becoming fatal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The hospital says it has been working on these models using artificial intelligence along with the data of real patients including those from Computed Tomography (CT) scans.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make the models' texture more similar to real human skin and tissue, the research team also used data from pigs and chickens to help build the models.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital hopes the new 3D models will help doctors treat pneumothorax cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Surgical intervention needs to be done promptly and swiftly especially for newborn babies whose conditions may deteriorate quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consultant for Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Dr Victor Chan explained that since the condition requires swift intervention, doctors need to be familiar with the procedure and have ample practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very complicated procedure, we need to follow the steps very meticulously, we can't risk the patient because of some inexperience or wrong steps. Therefore we need very good training on the doctors before we allow them to perform the procedure on a real patient," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the condition is not common, it can be hard for doctors to get hands-on experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that's why a simulation training, particularly on a nicely and beautifully made model, would be important," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hongkonger held prisoner and forced to work at a scam farm in Myanmar has been rescued and is back across the border in Thailand, SAR officials have confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's The Nation newspaper reported that the woman, 31, was freed on Sunday after the Thai police and army reached out to commanders of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army which controls an area south of Myawaddy in Myanmar where the woman was being detained by a "Chinese call-centre gang".
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent weeks, ransoms have been paid to secure the release of other Hongkongers being held captive in the region, but sources told RTHK that this was not the case this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Hong Kong's Security Bureau said a task force it set up in response to the detentions will "arrange for the individual's return to Hong Kong as soon as possible".
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the task force will "continue to actively assist and follow up on all relevant request-for-assistance cases of Hong Kong residents who have yet to return".
  <br>
  <br>
  Several SAR residents are still believed to be being held prisoner by criminal gangs in Southeast Asia.

    Over cleaning could trigger eczema in children: CUHK

<img alt="Researchers from Chinese University's medical school have found that pandemic babies had a higher risk of developing atopic diseases such as eczema. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790031_1_20250203091514.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) have found that children born during the pandemic are more likely to have atopic diseases like eczema, and over-sanitisation was one of the reasons for this.
 <br>
  <br>
  They analysed data from 1,152 children born in Hong Kong, including 155 children born before the pandemic and 997 pandemic babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  They observed that there was a 46 percent increase in the incidence of allergy for pandemic babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The research team said excessive cleaning could hinder babies in their ability to develop healthy gut bacteria, which is crucial for children in building a strong immune system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gut dysbiosis would increase the chance of children of getting skin diseases like eczama.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the researchers, Professor Siew Ng, said lacking resistance genes, children may not have the immunity to combat different types of bacteria or bugs in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is becoming more and more common after the Covid-19 pandemic. We found there’s a 46 percent increase. I think part of the reason is because we are basically disinfecting too much. The hygiene measures are basically too stringent,” Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the tips we would give parents is to reduce or maybe to alleviate some of these atopic diseases is -- I think number one, is that it's important to be hygienic, but I think we shouldn't be over aggressive in our behaviour,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK says it has also developed two new oral probiotics, named SIM03 and SIM05, for children and adults with eczema respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their pilot studies found that after taking these probiotics for three months, their eczema symptoms were relieved and their sleep quality improved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked when the probiotics would be available for sale, Ng said the university would like to do a larger study on the use of the two probiotics in different population groups first.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge saw a surge in travellers over Lunar New Year, officials say, with the number passing through the Zhuhai port hitting a record high on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Border inspection authorities said 156,000 inbound and outbound passenger trips were made through that port on the third day of the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the highest number since the facility opened in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday to Friday, more than 454,000 passenger trips were recorded through the port, marking a 22 percent increase when compared with the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department warned that it expected a large number of vehicles to use the bridge between Sunday evening and the early hours of Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Zhuhai said people were having to wait more than 40 minutes for inspections on Sunday afternoon.

    HK will share US pain following tariffs move: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said he expects Hong Kong interest rates will remain high for some time because of the tariffs the US has imposed on China, Canada and Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  An executive order from US President Donald Trump on Saturday introduced an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports, with a rate of 25 percent for the other two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the tariffs will hurt Americans more than anyone else because the extra costs incurred will be passed on to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the resulting inflationary pressures in the US will also affect Hong Kong, he warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If their inflation stays high, that should also affect us. Because after all, with the dollar peg, when US interest rates are high, rates in Hong Kong should also be high," Chan said on Commercial Radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This adds to the burden of business and affects the business environment and to a degree adds constraints to asset markets. These are things that we have to fully consider."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR government has made plans to deal with potential Trump policies, describing the president's governance style as "rather extreme at times".

    'Subsidies for the elderly must be retained'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Community activists are urging Financial Secretary Paul Chan to ring-fence spending on support for elderly people and look elsewhere as he seeks to balance the books.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) invited lawmakers Andrew Lam, Lam Chun-sing, David Lam and Tik Chi-yuen to a sharing session on Sunday to hear public concerns about living expenses, including worries about possible changes to a scheme that allows the over 60s to use public transport for just HK$2 per trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Hau, aged 64, said he hopes the government won't bump the minimum age for the subsidised fares back up to 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I work as a security guard. Sometimes I have to go all the way to Tuen Mun from Sham Shui Po for work. Scrapping the HK$2 subsidy would add to my burden,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m working hard, but I would be getting less assistance from the government. Is the government trying to encourage people not to work?”
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Tik said the travel subsidy has boosted elderly people's social mobility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more elderly people going out to work, they are volunteering in the community. This can improve their health in general, which is creating value for society. With better health, the elderly will not need to rely on the public medical system, or other social assistance that much," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo said while it understands the government needs to cut back on spending to address a budget deficit, it is important that a range of subsidies are protected, including the carer allowance and community healthcare schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other elderly people invited to the sharing session spoke of the financial difficulties they face, even with the subsidies provided by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I skip my meals to save up money. I haven’t eaten once in the past two days," said a woman surnamed Chin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile a woman in her seventies told the lawmakers that she struggled to look after her health while also caring for her husband who is bedbound.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ve been suffering from body aches [from taking care of my husband]. It's also hard for us to get to the doctor as taxis often do not want to take customers in a wheelchair. My doctor told me to get an MRI scan, but I don’t have money for that,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman said she is not eligible for a carer allowance of up to HK$3,000 because she gets Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and the Old Age Living Allowance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Lam Chun-sing said the government should consider relaxing the eligibility requirements for the carer allowance so people in the woman's situation can receive a portion of the subsidy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 How noisy 50,000 excited football fans can get will be put to the test this week as the roof of the main stadium is retracted for the first time in a series of trial runs at the new Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say the stadium will be packed on Tuesday for a Hong Kong Premier League U22 match between Kitchee and North District.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing on Sunday, sports commissioner George Tsoi said opening the roof will allow the Environmental Protection Department to check how much of a noise nuisance events at the stadium could potentially pose to residents of nearby areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that officials also want to see how opening the roof affects the experience of those inside the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last time when we had a sports event in early January, we found that the overall ambience, when the retractable roof was closed, was very good. Because when the audience were cheering for their teams, the sound effects were very good," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we are going to open the retractable roof to see how the ambience, as well as other production effects, would be going on in sports events."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said they also want to see how easy it is for 50,000 people to leave the stadium after an event, with services on the MTR's Tuen Ma and Kwun Tong lines to be enhanced and 10 special bus services to be laid on for the test event.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There is broad public agreement that changes have to be made to Hong Kong's HK$2 transport fares for the over 60s, Paul Chan said on Sunday, as he suggested healthcare and education could also be in line for government spending cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  On a Commercial Radio programme, the financial secretary said the intentions behind the HK$2 scheme were very good, but the expenses involved have been mounting since the eligible age was lowered from the original 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there's a public consensus that the current scheme isn't financially sustainable over the long run, if no changes are made to it. So how should we change it?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are so many different views. We're collecting them and then officials will assess them and discuss them internally. We're all looking at different proposals in detail."
  <br>
  <br>
  With his budget speech coming up on February 26, Chan said there is room to save money in areas including education and healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said universities have relatively large amounts of reserves, adding that everyone can play their part in the next couple of years to tackle the government's budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said, however, that the government will minimise the effects of expenditure cuts on the public.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong is in for an exciting year filled with major events.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on social media after attending the Lunar New Year Cup football match at Hong Kong Stadium on Saturday night, Chan praised both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the Hong Kong Legends and World Legends teams had delivered entertaining games, featuring impressive goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match was drawn 3-3 at full time, but the World Legends won a penalty shoot-out 6-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  He praised the lively atmosphere at the stadium, where around 20,000 fans turned up for the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the game - featuring top international players and local soccer stars - was the perfect way for local and visiting soccer fans to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday.

    Unjabbed 19-month-old boy in intensive care with flu

<img alt="The Centre for Health Protection is calling on parents to make sure their kids get vaccinated. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789926_1_20250201204812.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection on Saturday said a 19-month-old boy is in critical condition after being infected with influenza A. He was clinically diagnosed with influenza A complicated by severe pneumonia and is still hospitalised.
 <br>
  <br>
  He has not received the seasonal influenza vaccine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the flu season began in Hong Kong last month, a total of nine cases of severe influenza virus infections in children have been reported. Seven of the children had not been vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities say they expect influenza activity to increase further, and the activity of other respiratory infectious diseases may also increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection said that in this latest case, the boy had been in good health before, but has had a fever and cough since Thursday. He was taken to the Baptist Hospital for treatment yesterday and subsequently transferred to Kwong Wah Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is currently still in the paediatric intensive care unit. The boy did not travel abroad during the incubation period and his home contacts have no symptoms at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre said that as of January 26, the seasonal influenza vaccination rate for children aged six months to under two years old was still low, at about 20.9 percent. Although it has increased slightly compared to the same period last year, it is still lower than the vaccination rate of children in other age groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre again called on people who have not yet received the seasonal flu jab to take immediate action, to reduce the risk of severe illness and death. The CHP also reiterated its call for all parents to make sure their children have been vaccinated.

    'Don't just look at projected flat completion'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said it is inappropriate to simply look at projected unit completion as the total supply volume for private flats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the government announced that some 107,000 private units may be available for sale in the coming three to four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her Facebook page, Ho said she is aware of online discussions about the number being overly optimistic and that there might not be that many flats available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho explained that the figure includes completed units that are still unsold, units currently being built, and those whose construction hasn't started yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing minister stressed that the administration has been consistent in how they release data, and such information can be traced back for more than a decade to avoid confusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also noted that nearly 19,000 private flats had been completed each year over the past five years, saying this shows the government’s success in balancing demand and supply.

    Sports dispute resolution scheme to start this year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung revealed on Saturday that the pilot scheme for sports dispute resolution will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The idea was first unveiled in the Policy Address last year with the aim of promoting sports arbitration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung told a television programme that the scheme will run for two to three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  While it is not mandatory for subvented sports associations to participate in the test run, he said they are highly encouraged to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he believes sports groups can improve their governance by joining the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can show the public that when they have internal issues that cannot be resolved, they are willing to solve them through a fair and open system which has good value for money," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not expensive and won't take much time. And it won't hinder the development of elite athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung noted that athletes participating in the Olympics have limited time and have to undergo intensive training.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the matter is dealt with in court, the athletes will lose the chance to participate in the competition due to ongoing legal procedures, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deputy justice chief pointed out that the arbitration rules will be set up by the middle of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will look for a suitable arbitration body in the coming months, which has to be experienced and have close contact with the sports industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will subsidise part of the cost of arbitration during the test run, he added.

    University fees rise won't hurt competitiveness: Choi

<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi said on Saturday that a rise in school fees will not hurt the competitiveness of the SAR’s universities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting the next academic year, the government will hike the current tuition fees of HK$42,100 for eight public universities by just under 18 percent in phased increases over three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fees have been frozen for almost three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi told an RTHK radio programme that she believes the move will not affect the universities’ teaching, research and attractiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For most of the time, apart from relying on government funding as their source of income, the institutions have also had donations. And besides undergraduate programmes, they've taught postgraduate programmes which consist of more self-financing students,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Universities have different sources of income. Of course, funding will have some impact on them. But we note that they also have relatively sound reserves or financial management.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the institutions will have sufficient time to make arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi also revealed that the government has no plan to gradually increase the tuition fees of non-local students until it's recovered all costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that Singapore is charging non-local students between HK$100,000 and HK$200,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said that if the SAR hiked fees to more than HK$300,000, local universities will not be able to attract top talent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Preliminary figures for the Lunar New Year point to a rebound in tourist numbers, including overseas visitors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board said on Saturday that Hong Kong attracted close to 680,000 tourists from Tuesday to Friday, a 6 percent year-on-year increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board's executive director Dane Cheng told a Commercial Radio programme that the percentage increase for overseas visitors was even better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From Lunar New Year Eve to Thursday, there was a 12 percent year-on-year increase. People might feel that the vibe is better because most of them congregated in the tourist hot spots,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hiked to the Peak with my family [on Friday], and it was super crowded. There were people in every mall and restaurant, and the Peak tram station was packed with people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  There were more than 560,000 mainland visitors in the first four days of their eight-day Golden Week holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said he expects more mainlanders to visit Hong Kong in the coming days, noting many of them might have been spending time with their families earlier in the holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that about half of the inbound tourists stayed overnight, and most hotels were nearly fully booked

    Border travel smooth over Lunar New Year: CS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Saturday that things went smoothly at the border crossings during the Lunar New Year holiday, despite changes from last year's travel arrangements.
 <br>
  <br>
  Unlike last year, border checkpoints at Lo Wu and Shenzhen Bay didn't extend their hours, leaving Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Port to operate around-the-clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told a Commercial Radio programme that officials had acted to ensure smooth travel arrangements for tourists heading back to the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Even though we didn't operate some border points right through the night, we were concerned that some people might think Lo Wu was still open after midnight, and take the train. So we made announcements on the trains to keep them informed, and in Sheung Shui, we arranged an overnight shuttle bus going to the border checkpoints that did remain open all night,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said he'd heard anecdotal evidence from the hotel sector and retailers that business is going well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged Hongkongers to stay in the SAR to spend, saying they can also find cheap and good quality options here.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the government had earlier partnered with five restaurant chains - Fairwood, Cafe de Coral, Tai Hing, Maxim's, and McDonald's - to distribute food coupons to about 50,000 elderly people through 214 elderly centres across Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each of them will receive five coupons, allowing them to buy designated meals at a discounted price of HK$25.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the feedback has been positive so far, and he hopes it will motivate more isolated seniors to leave their homes and engage with the community.

 The Tourism Bureau said the Travel Industry Authority is working with Miramar Travel to help relatives of a male tour guide who died in a traffic accident in Shanghai on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The coach was taking a 16-member tour group to Shanghai Pudong International Airport when the accident occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miramar general manager Alex Lee said the travel agency would not speculate on the cause of the incident, which is under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've already contacted his family. Only one of them was in a position to go to Shanghai, but their mainland travel permit had expired," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Immigration Department is helping us to find a way to help the family member. Our company will also send a staffer to travel to Shanghai with his family."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said all members of the six-day tour group have now returned to the SAR, including two who felt unwell and had undergone medical tests in a hospital in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that as far as he knew, no one had been arrested in relation to the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said it's reached out to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai, as well as the Travel Industry Authority, and would follow up on the case.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The racecourse has rolled out the red carpet for tens of thousands of people on Friday for the Chinese New Year Raceday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 86 thousand revellers came to Sha Tin Racecourse, according to the Jockey Club, including record high numbers of tourists from the mainland and overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law, was in attendance and said she was delighted to see such a high turnout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the crowd was an Italian tourist, who told an RTHK reporter that he's thrilled to experience the unique horse racing culture in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's amazing. Lots of lights, sounds, crowds everywhere. It's similar but quite different because it's not so famous and popular in Italy. [Only] a few people follow horse racing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another tourist from Canada said he enjoyed the festive atmosphere, including special Chinese New Year features and installations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a Jockey simulator. That's one that I really wanted to do. We took pictures with the guy who's giving out candies. It's a very nice event and there's a lot of different things for Chinese New Year that make it truly special," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Law also told reporters that 216,000 travellers set foot in the SAR on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A majority of them, or more than 187,000 were visitors from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  This Lunar New Year marks the first since the government resumed the three percent hotel accommodation tax on January 1, after it had been suspended since July, 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourism minister said the tax is here to stay, as people have adapted to the measure before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've charged the three percent hotel accommodation tax before. As long as visitors have fun in Hong Kong, and think that it's good value for money, the three percent tax won't have too much of an impact on them."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that with many hotels reaching an occupancy rate of 100 percent these days, it showed that visitors were attracted by Hong Kong's festive spirit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan was also at the Sha Tin racecourse to officiate the opening ceremony with Law.

    'Rise in investment scams, impersonation of officials'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The police commissioner on Friday warned the public to be on guard, amid a rise in investment scams in recent months, with most cases involving cryptocurrency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Siu revealed that the frauds usually begin with fake romances - scammers would show concern for their target before providing them with a link.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised the cases were too good to be true, and the public should never fall for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief also said there had been a surge in cases in which scammers pretended to be mainland officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whenever the caller claims to be an official from the mainland, and says he - or she - is investigating a case etc, you can actually hang up immediately," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if they don't ask for money, you can hang up right away. These must be scams."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the force is working to roll out more measures to combat scams targetting students from the mainland, and hopes to intercept the cases at sources.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Worshippers on Friday flocked to Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin to pray for good fortune and prosperity in the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to Chinese traditions, people tend to avoid visiting family and friends on the third day of the Lunar New Year when quarrels are believed to be more likely.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police implemented crowd control measures as devotees queued to offer prayers and buy pinwheels, a traditional blessing item at the temple.
  <br>
  <br>
  One worshipper told RTHK that she's there to pray for good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The crowd seems smaller compared to last year, probably because many people are travelling abroad or up north," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pinwheel vendor who usually prices the items at HK$68 said sales are down by 60 to 70 percent compared to previous years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was upbeat about the SAR's economic prospects, comparing the city to a phoenix.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope Hong Kong will thrive and return to its former glory. After all, Hong Kong is a phoenix that never dies. It's normal to have ups and downs," he said.

    HK sees a smaller rise in outbound tours over LNY
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789786_1_20250131105710.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Association said on Friday that even though the city saw a rise in outbound tour groups over the Lunar New Year holiday, it was smaller than the increase in 2024 when the city celebrated the festival for the first time since the lifting of Covid restrictions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, executive director Timothy Chui said many of the tours were destined for Japan and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a flight was scheduled to Japan every 15 minutes, joking that it was even more frequent than buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui said there were two factors leading to the change in the increment of tour groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[First] this Lunar New Year holiday and the Christmas holiday are just separated by about 20 days, which is very close," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Second, last year there was [so-called] 'revenge spending'. Customers signed up for tours. They didn't ask about prices, they just wanted to know if tours were available and how many vacancies there were. But this year, they've been comparing packages on offer - and prices."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said tour prices were similar to last year, except for those heading to the Greater Bay Area that cost slightly more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui revealed while usually only around 500 tours were bound for the mainland on the weekend, a daily 600 to 800 tour groups had set off for the mainland in the past few days.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for incoming tour groups, he said those staying overnight accounted for 50 percent of the total number of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui said the number of mainlanders entering the SAR through the Shenzhen Bay port on Lunar New Year's Eve had surged by about 43 percent year-on-year. He said the increase was mainly due to the resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that hotels were almost 100 percent full between Lunar New Year's Eve and Saturday, and the figure will only start to come down next Monday and Tuesday.

    'More non-local race broadcasts to boost economy'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Friday said the Jockey Club's plan to broadcast more non-local horse racing events will boost Hong Kong's tourism and betting revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  The club wants to increase the maximum number of simulcast races per season from 25 to 55, and the maximum number of simulcast days per season from 37 to 70 in 2026/27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo Wai-kwok, who chairs the Business and Professionals Alliance, said local racing fans' appetite for international events is on the rise, and the change would benefit society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will increase investment and the Jockey Club's revenue. This benefits Hong Kong because the Jockey Club is actually a very successful social enterprise," Lo told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of its earnings flow back into society, not just through betting taxes paid to the Hong Kong government, but also through substantial investments in social welfare such as schools, hospitals and care homes."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker said the initiative is also expected to boost tourism, noting that the New Year's Day race saw mainland visitor numbers double to 4,120 compared to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apollo Ng, chairman of the Hong Kong Thoroughbred Breeders' Alliance, told the same programme that there aren't enough overseas race broadcasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said the proposal will help keep local fans engaged - especially during the racing off-season from mid-July to early September, when some fans may travel elsewhere to gamble.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public have until February 21 to submit their views on the proposal to the Betting and Lotteries Commission.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourists and locals were treated to a spectacular Lunar New Year fireworks display over Victoria Harbour on Thursday, the second day of the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  Divided into nine named pyrotechnic scenes, the show began with "A Brand New Beginning", featuring the lucky number eight in red.
  <br>
  <br>
  It then moved on to gold ingots, symbolising prosperity and abundance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eighth scene "Double Luck and Goodness" showed six panda faces, representing the number of pandas in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show concluded with "Year of the Snake". This scene filled the sky with star-patterned pyrotechnics to the sound of Chinese gongs and drums.
  <br>
  <br>
  The display began at 8 pm and lasted 23 minutes. It was coordinated by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau.

 Thousands of people gathered around Victoria Harbour on Thursday for the New Year firework display, traditionally held on the second day of the Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  A secondary school student told RTHK she had arrived at 3.30 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to enjoy the festive atmosphere, and get a good spot. This is the first time I have come to see the fireworks. I think the weather is quite good today. I decided to go out and see how much better watching the fireworks is, compared to seeing them on television," she said, adding that she brought a book and some food to kill time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man said he is looking forward to seeing the panda patterns, which appear in one of the scenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came at around one, and I think it's worth it. I brought a tripod and a camera to take photos. I think fireworks are so beautiful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Shenzhen said he had come to Hong Kong just for the display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think having more than 20,000 fireworks will be magnificent, and the themes are also very meaningful. I was busy seeing my relatives on the first day of the Lunar New Year, so I missed the fireworks in Guangzhou. I can also appreciate the view of Victoria Harbour, while seeing the fireworks here," the man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police closed off a number of roads on both sides of the harbour ahead of the display.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering representative said on Thursday that reservations at Chinese restaurants over Lunar New Year were up ten percent from last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management chairman, Leung Chun-wah, said despite a number of Hong Kong residents travelling during the holidays, those who stayed in the city were willing to spend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lunar New Year is the happiest festival for Chinese people. The number of people flying out was not too many, somewhere between 300,000 to 400,000 people. People still have to eat their meals, and they want to be happy while doing so. So, our business and reservation numbers both saw a ten percent increase," he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 357,927 Hong Kong residents departed the city on Wednesday, according to Immigration Department figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Leung said restaurants generally saw just one round of customers early in the evening, as people's eating habits had changed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People eat early and leave early. We don't really see a second round of customers - those who go to restaurants at 8:30 pm for dinner," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also noted that customers were spending less than before the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the average spending per person was between HK$350 to HK$400 - similar to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the resumption of the multi-entry visa for Shenzhen residents only benefited restaurants in tourist spots, which recorded an around 20 percent increase in business.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Thursday said there's a chance that interest rates in the city will remain at "relatively high levels" for a while, after the US central bank kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve had left key overnight interest rates steady in the 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent target range, with its chair Jerome Powell saying there would be no rush to cut them again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's de-facto central bank said in response that the policy decision was "in line with market expectations".
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, the pace of future rate cuts remains uncertain as it is dependent on US inflation and labour market data developments, the effect of previous rate cuts, as well as the impact of fiscal, economic and trade policies adopted by the new administration on economic activity," the authority said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates in Hong Kong might still remain at relatively high levels for some time, and the extent and pace of future US interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public should exercise caution when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added it would continue to closely monitor market developments and maintain monetary and financial stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It stressed that the city's financial and monetary markets have continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Market liquidity condition has remained stable, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate stays steady," the authority said.

    Fortune urges practical measures, says rural chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rural leader has urged officials to come up with policies that are practical rather than window dressing in the upcoming budget, after drawing a fortune stick for Hong Kong in an annual Lunar New Year ritual.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday morning, Heung Yee Kuk chairman Kenneth Lau picked a No 24 "neutral" stick at the Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stick corresponds to a prophecy that roughly translates to: "Live a life without wrongdoing, it is only greed that stirs up trouble; with the help of noble people, don't waste your efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Interpreting the message, Lau said it means doing the right thing and that Hong Kong needs the support of the country. He also appealed to Financial Secretary Paul Chan to roll out practical economic measures in his budget, which will be unveiled on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the financial secretary will particularly take care of the middle class and the underprivileged, and not increase fees or taxes," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When putting in resources, officials should not do things that are just window dressing, they should be practical... Under this global economic situation and high interest rate environment, the government has to promote the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Each year, the head of the rural body goes to the Che Kung Temple on the second day of the Lunar New Year to draw a fortune stick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau initially thought he drew the number 20 stick, but later said he had made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the chairman of the Sha Tin Rural Committee drew an ill-omened No 82 stick for the Sha Tin community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 96 sticks in the cup, 35 are “positive” sticks, 17 are “negative” ones, while 44 are "neutral".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lunar New Year parade took place in Tsim Sha Tsui on Wednesday, with Chief Executive John Lee opening the event.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, the Chief Executive told the crowd that there was no better place to ring in the Chinese New Year than Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only in Hong Kong, the world's East-meets-West centre for cultural exchange and day-and-night entertainment, all around town you'll be greeted by the magnificent spectacle of our festivities and the warm hospitality of the people of Hong Kong, as we share the joy of the year with all of you. I wish you all a happy, healthy, and eventful Year of the Snake."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said this year's parade, themed "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", featured 55 performing groups and floats, which showcased Hong Kong, as well as 14 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are "here in the world city of Hong Kong to dance, sing and perform, skip, juggle, cheerlead and otherwise amaze and delight you in this most auspicious of days," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The night parade started at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza at 8 pm, then headed down Canton Road, Haiphong Road, and Nathan Road, before ending at the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, organiser Hong Kong Tourism Board said it expected around 100,000 people to turn up for the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the Spring Festival celebrations, Lee added that the floats and some of Wednesday night's performances will move to Lam Tsuen for Thursday's Hong Kong Well-wishing Festival. The floats will be on display there until February 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other festivities include a 23-minute firework show on both sides of Victoria Harbour on the second day of the Lunar New Year, as well as horse racing at Sha Tin on the third day.

 Crowds gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui on Wednesday for the Lunar New Year parade .
 <br>
  <br>
  Themed "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", it features nine floats showcasing unique elements from the SAR, alongside 46 performing groups from around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will start at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza, then head down Canton Road, Haiphong Road, and Nathan Road, before ending at the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Road closures and traffic diversions have been put in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Leung said she came to support her daughter, who will be performing in the parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My daughter will be dancing, so I must show my support. I have been here since around 3 pm, after sending her to the assembly venue. I am very excited about seeing her, and it is also my first time to see the parade in person," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist surnamed Jia from Northeast China said she had come to Hong Kong for the festive atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think Hong Kong has a very strong Lunar New Year vibe and I love the culture around the Greater Bay Area. I know there will be a parade tonight and fireworks tomorrow, and I booked my hotel last November," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Shenzhen tourist surnamed Huang said this is her second time at the parade..
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, I did not pick a good spot. So this year, I learned from my past experience and arrived at 2.30 pm. The location I am in is the performance area, so the lighting will be nicer," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang said she found the float designs delicate and the performing groups from around the world very attractive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board expects around 100,000 people to turn up for the event.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority’s acting chief executive Vivian Cheung on Wednesday said she expected passenger numbers to be about 30 percent higher this Lunar New Year holiday, when compared to last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  She said the airport had been operating smoothly and around 160,000 people had passed through on the first day of the Year of the Snake. That's about 20 percent fewer than on the peak days earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The last few days were a peak period and the airport saw around 200,000 people a day, which almost reached the level before the pandemic,” Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, we have around 75 pairs of flights between Hong Kong and 13 Japanese cities every day, meaning there’s a flight every 15 minutes. It’s very convenient for Hongkongers to travel,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also expected flight movements this year to return to the pre-pandemic level, with the airport seeing around 1,100 flights taking off and landing each day.

 People headed to the Lam Tsuen Wishing Tree in Taipo on Wednesday, a traditional event on the first day of Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  It's believed that throwing a placard with one's wishes, and a mandarin, onto the tree will make the wish come true.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wished everyone good fortune, good health and for wishes to come true. And for a better year. Everyone went through Covid over the past few years, I hope everyone's luck will improve every year. My grandson successfully threw the placard onto the tree on his first try. It's the first time, we got so lucky," said a man surnamed Pang, who arrived at around 9 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  A boy surnamed Pang said it took him four times to make his wish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I threw the placard a few times before it landed on the tree. It's so difficult. The wind affects where it lands, and it falls off. I had to jump to make sure it hung on the tree," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wished for better exam results because my scores are bad. I hope I get better grades in Maths, English and Chinese. I also wished to go to Japan because the place has a lot of food and things that I like," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sophie, who's originally from England, said she came early to avoid the crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We thought it was going to be very busy. We made a wish on the tree, and we put a wish in the lotus pond as well. On my card, I said I wanted a year of adventure and fun. I've only lived in Hong Kong for four months, and I have lots to learn about this beautiful city," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law was also at the venue. She wished for Hong Kong athletes to achieve good results in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, she said she hoped tourists would enjoy a happy Lunar New Year in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a float parade tonight, fireworks for tomorrow, horse racing on the third day, and the Lunar New Year Cup on the fourth day. There's also a lot of activities at temples, and today is also a great day for hiking. I believe everyone will spend a happy Spring Festival in Hong Kong," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the Lam Tsuen Well-wishing Bazaar has been scaled up, with a Tai Po district council member saying it will boost the festive atmosphere and local economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, introduced last year, starts on Wednesday and runs until February 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK programme, Lo Hiu-fung said he expected an increase in footfall of at least 10 percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw a lot of nearby residents and tourists coming to the bazaar at night, last year. So this year, we decided to host the event again, and we made it bigger. The number of food stalls have doubled to more than 20," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the event would again feature floats this year.

 Hong Kong welcomed the first baby of the Year of the Snake at Union Hospital.
 <br>
  <br>
  The baby girl, weighing 3.02 kilograms, was born at midnight on Wednesday, and is the first child of the Lee family.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first-time parents said they were joyful and touched to have a healthy baby.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I will rearrange my hobbies. My focus will be on her from now on,” Mr. Lee said.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the space oil drug problem in Hong Kong has got worse at a rapid rate over the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is planning to list etomidate, a main component of the substance, as a dangerous drug on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Tang said the number of cases related to space oil increased drastically last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Actually the situation has worsened rapidly over the past year. The number of cases in 2024 was seven times more than in 2023, and the number of those arrested increased 11 fold. The amount of space oil drug seized also increased at least four times," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see how serious the problem is and therefore, we need to handle it through legislation,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the government will boost education related to the substance on social media and schools, and also equip teachers to help identify students who use the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Tang also spoke about the proposed legislation on protection of critical infrastructures. He said the legislation is to ensure the operations of key facilities such as water and electricity, if they come under cyber-attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said large corporations will have the responsibility to protect their computer systems, and to report to the government if they face cyber-attacks, as well as having a contingency plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said individuals and small businesses will not be affected by the proposed law.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Citybus has said it is providing training for their drivers to help them better understand the needs of older passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 850 bus captains have attended Citybus' one-day training programme since it was rolled out last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the training, drivers put on special outfits and goggles to restrict their sight and movement, and carry canes to simulate what senior passengers experience when they take the bus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some elderly residents were also invited to the training sessions to tell drivers what they can do to make their journeys safer and more comfortable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Currently, Citybus is the only bus operator in Hong Kong to provide such training to our bus captains. We will continue to provide this kind of training. We forecast that by 2026, all of our 4,000 [drivers] will have attended such training to provide them knowledge on how to take care of our elderly passengers in Hong Kong,” Citybus General Manager Roger Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also revealed that there are about 100 bus captain spots vacant at Citybus, despite recording a net increase of more than 400 drivers last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the bus company would focus more on recruitment and come up with different campaigns to attract prospective drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August of last year, Citybus rolled out a new recruitment campaign to look for drivers who want to work three days a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bus operator said it received more than 1,000 applications from the recruitment drive, and hired and trained 160 people.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Tuesday said three more children are in intensive care with severe flu.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the centre said the first case involved a six-year-old boy with good past health. It said his household contacts so far have no symptoms and there was no flu outbreak at his school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second involves a 12-year-old boy with an underlying illness. He lives in a school dormitory and seven other students from the same school recently had upper respiratory symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The above-mentioned two boys had no travel history during the incubation period. An initial investigation revealed that they did not receive 2024/25 SIV [seasonal influenza vaccine]," a spokesman for the CHP said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third case is an eight-year-old boy with good past health. He was diagnosed with flu and another serious infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre says this brings to eight the number of severe flu cases in children, since the flu season began this month. It said six of the children were unvaccinated against seasonal flu.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday visited a Lunar New Year fair in Tuen Mun, before the fairs end early tomorrow morning on the first day of the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  He bought 10 gladiolus, or sword lilies, which symbolise perfectness and moving forward, along with a pinwheel for good deeds and good luck, and an ornament that represents connecting the community together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, Lee said he thinks business at the fair will improve later in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The popularity of stalls and products differ. Some are doing well, while some are still struggling. I believe when it gets darker, business at the fair will get better as we get closer to the New Year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee gave citizens his best wishes and called for Hongkongers to shop at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be the Year of the Snake tomorrow. The snake is agile, which indicates that Hong Kong will seek and respond to changes. I wish everyone good luck, have a great time during the Lantern Festival and other activities, and also good health," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan went to a fair at Victoria Park, where he chatted with a few stall owners and took pictures with citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spent around HK$1,000 to purchase a giant panda plush toy, a cushion, a pinwheel, and some orchids.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said he hopes more citizens will visit Lunar New Year fairs across the city ahead of the festival.

    Businesses cautiously optimistic ahead of LNY

 Vendors were on the fence on Tuesday about how much revenue they would generate as people flocked to wet markets to buy food for their family reunion dinners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Reunion dinner on Lunar New Year’s Eve is traditionally regarded as the most important meal of the year in Chinese culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man said he spent over HK$1,000 shopping at the wet market.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I picked up things like clams and shrimp. They are a little pricier this year, about 10 percent more than last year. But it’s New Year, so that’s expected,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A vegetable seller at Kowloon City Market said business was pretty rough overall, noting that lettuce was the only top seller because it symbolises the generation of wealth in Chinese.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a poultry vendor at the same market was not worried about her sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People usually buy one or two chickens and don’t mind the price. They are willing to spend big as long as the chickens are fresh. Whether it’s HK$300, HK$400 or HK$500 it doesn’t matter,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “During New Year, everything is a bit pricier and that’s just part of the festive atmosphere. People don't even bother asking about the price.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong, president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said business activity for the catering sector was better than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while many Hongkongers travel to the mainland during the holiday, those who stay in the city are more willing to dine out.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Overall, I believe business over the Lunar New Year holiday is more than 10 percent better than last year,” he said.

 Chief Executive John Lee issued a Lunar New Year message on Tuesday, saying that Hong Kong would be agile and resilient in the Year of the Snake, and would continue to seek innovation and change.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the pre-recorded message, John Lee said the city has had a year full of cheer, including the gift of two giant pandas from Beijing and the birth of two panda cubs - which will greet the public in mid-February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The video also featured various snake and panda decorations, along with a variety of Lunar New Year specialities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also wished good health and good fortune to Hongkongers in the coming year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year is the Year of the Snake - which is nimble and agile, and symbolises prosperity and wealth. This year, Hong Kong will again show off its agility, and resilience, with flexible thinking - to innovate, reform and develop," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My wife and I wish Hong Kong's people good health in the Year of the Snake. May you have joy, prosperity and good fortune," he added.

    Cross-border bus services up by 20pc during LNY

 Cross border coach operators will increase their frequency of services by 20 percent over the Lunar New Year holiday, the Hong Kong Guangdong Boundary Crossing Bus Association said today.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice chairman Freeman Cheung told an RTHK radio programme that he expects the city to see the highest number of Hongkongers heading north on Thursday and Friday, while the number of travellers returning from the mainland is expected to peak on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Usually, cross-border coaches are less than 50 percent full. But during the Lunar New Year holiday and other festivities, this can rise to 80 percent - or even 100 percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung welcomed the government's decision not to operate border checkpoints beyond the usual hours during the period, as he expects there will only be a slightly higher flow of tourists on the second day of the holiday due to the fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes by arranging more coaches at hotspots such as Wan Chai, West Kowloon and Prince Edward an hour after the fireworks show – which he expected to be the peak period of travellers heading home – they would be able to divert the flow of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the move would allow operators to allocate more resources for the rush hour during the daytime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, local florist Yeung Siu-lung pointed out that business had improved by 10 percent compared with the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he had not raised prices in recent years amid the poor economy and inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from selling orchids at the Victoria Park flower market, he also grows and sells them in Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The people who buy more flowers tend to drive, and they get pots. Why do I say business is up by 10 percent this year? It's because the old customers have recommended the market to new customers. There are more unfamiliar faces,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also said that there was a need to boost sales to make customers happy on the final full day of the market, before it closes tomorrow morning.

 A Hong Kong resident who had been detained for illegal work in Myanmar returned to the SAR late Monday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Accompanied by members of a government task force, the man arrived at the Hong Kong International Airport via a flight from Bangkok. He was subsequently taken to the airport police station.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a press briefing, Assistant Secretary for Security Paddy Yuen said the man is very happy to be back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was grateful to see us head to Thailand to follow up on his case, and very excited to be able to return to Hong Kong, and reunite with his family before the Lunar New Year," Yuen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said he won’t disclose additional details of the case, including whether a ransom was paid, to avoid complicating the future course of action.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked Chinese diplomats in Southeast Asia, as well as local authorities for assisting in the rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen added that work is still underway to bring the rest of the victims home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also remember that there are still ten Hong Kong residents who have not been released," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assistant security chief reminded Hongkongers to stay vigilant against job offers that promise high salaries without the need for professional skills, or require the person to transport goods between places.

 The government office responsible for providing insolvency services has issued an apology after magnetic tapes containing information of about 76,000 people went missing.
 <br>
  <br>
  However, it stressed chances of a data leak is "extremely low".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Official Receiver's Office revealed on Monday that seven magnetic backup tapes were lost while being delivered from Immigration Tower to Queensway Government Offices on December 23 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the office only received a report about the incident last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Official Receiver's Office] expresses sincere apologies for the loss and for the delay in reporting the incident," a spokesperson for the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tapes were stored in a locked protective case and information on them had been encrypted by a system "used extensively in government and military applications", according to the office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Official Receiver's Office] considers that the risk of leakage of personal data from the tapes is extremely low. Based on the current investigation, there is no evidence that the data contained on the tapes has been read or compromised," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tapes contained personal data of about 76,000 individuals, including creditors of insolvency cases and serving staff of the [Official Receiver's Office]."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said it has made changes to existing procedures and is conducting a thorough investigation, including on the delay in reporting the incident to senior management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken, the office added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Director of Immigration on Monday said he is confident that Hong Kong’s border checkpoints have enough capacity to handle an influx of tourists during the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Border crossings won’t operate beyond the usual hours during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a year-end press conference, Benson Kwok said he expects 7.3 million land border crossings during the eight-day holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our border capacity is enough to handle the large crowds of tourists. But of course we hope the travellers will arrive or depart Hong Kong out of the peak periods, so that they don’t waste too much time at the control points,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok also said there were a total of 298 million inbound and outbound trips last year, 40 percent up from 2023 and close to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  On 10 Hongkongers held prisoner in Southeast Asia and forced to take part in scams, Kwok said the department will continue to assist security officials in trying to get them released.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are quite a lot of challenges but the Immigration Department is supporting the special team to provide assistance to the assistance seekers,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We sincerely hope that our special team can help them to come back to Hong Kong in the very very near future, and even to enjoy Chinese New Year with their family members.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Kwok said children aged seven or above with an SAR passport and permanent Hong Kong identity card will soon be able to use e-channels at control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The immigration chief said he expects around 200,000 children will benefit from the new measure.

    Public lack knowledge of space oil drug: survey

<img alt="TWGH CROSS Centre’s clinical psychologist Christopher Sin, left, said a lack of understanding would cause more people to use the drug.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey by a drug counselling centre under the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals found that 30 percent of respondents were unaware of the harmful effects of the "space oil drug."
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre polled around 1,600 citizens aged between 15 and 56 from September to December last year. About half of them were under the age of 15, and almost 80 percent of them were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that more than 70 percent of those surveyed mistakenly believed nicotine and synthetic cannabinoids were the main ingredient of the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital group's CROSS Centre’s clinical psychologist Christopher Sin on Monday said a lack of understanding would lead to more young people using the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If their perception of space oil is [that] the ingredients are nicotine or cannabinoids, then they will easily be in contact with this kind of harmful substance under peer influence or via internet advertisements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Speaking of the long term, if they don't have a [good] understanding of the ingredients, this will increase the chances of [them] depending on this substance to manage their life hassles or other life issues," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sin pointed out that respondents might also want to try the drug out of curiosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the centre said more than 10 percent of its current 526 substance abuse cases had taken the space oil drug. Among them, 55 percent were minors, with the youngest being 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity called for more promotion of the harmful effects through various social media platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged parents and schools to take action if they think youngsters have been taking the substance while being aware of some of the tell-tale side effects, such as losing control of one's emotions, loss of balance and convulsive movements.

 As the Year of the Snake approaches, various floats and international performing groups are putting the finishing touches on their preparations for the annual Chinese New Year night parade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board and sponsored by Cathay Pacific, the parade will kick off at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza, winding its way through Canton, Haiphong and Nathan roads, before reaching the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s festivities, under the theme "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", will feature nine floats showcasing unique elements from the SAR, alongside 46 performing groups from around the globe, to highlight the city's reputation as an events capital.

 Officials closed the Cheung Sha Wan Lunar New Year fair for several hours on Monday after some stalls were damaged by strong winds overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  Goods were left scattered on the ground and scaffolding was damaged, with a similar scene at a fair in Tsz Wan Shan.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman selling orchids at Cheung Sha Wan told RTHK she thinks she has lost tens of thousands of dollars due to the damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the entire year, the two days before the Lunar New Year is the most important for business. This is really miserable for farmers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan inspected the scene in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair reopened at around 3pm after damaged scaffolding was removed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is launching a new season of the series "The Nitty Gritty of Law" with the Law Society next month to explore different legal issues with experts in the field.
 <br>
  <br>
  RTHK assistant director Vincent Lee told a launch ceremony on Monday that the inaugural season of the programme, which was solely in audio form, had been well-received.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the coming season will also be aired on television and online platforms, while introducing a radio drama to promote legal knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roden Tong, the president of the Law Society, said he hopes audiences can learn more about the law through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The programme, which has 16 episodes, will be aired on Sundays with the first episode launching on February 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The episodes will first be aired from 12.15pm to 1pm on RTHK Radio 1, before being broadcast on RTHK TV 31 on 7pm. They are also available on RTHK's website and mobile app.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legal experts, such as former secretary for justice Elsie Leung and a number of ex-Law Society heads, will be invited to the show to discuss various legal topics, such as family law, criminal law, and intellectual property.

 Monday marks the 28th day of the 12th lunar month.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to Chinese tradition, it is a day designated for "spring cleaning", when families deep-clean their homes in the run up to the Lunar New Year and put up new "fai chuns" -- red banners bearing auspicious phrases.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the market is flooded with mass produced, digitally-printed "fai chuns", many people still prefer the more traditional, handwritten ones that are becoming quite rare these days.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK visited an elderly calligraphy master in North Point, and asked him why it's so important to preserve this traditional craft.

 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said the government would conduct a strategic review of the use of the city's performance venues.
 <br>
  <br>
  Law expected this would be completed by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Ta Kung Pao published on Monday, Law said Hong Kong would have more venues to stage more kinds of performances and sports events.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include the Kai Tak Sports Park, and the WestK Performing Arts Centre that is set to be completed next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority also recently announced that it would build the second phase of the AsiaWorld-Expo to expand the total exhibition space to 100,000 square metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is set for completion in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This venue has a favourable location, [it’s] near the airport, and [it’s also] convenient for Zhuhai and Macau travellers to head to. I have high hopes [for the venue],” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With more venues, she said the SAR would be able to stage more events.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If there is a better allocation, world-class venues can carry out more world-class performances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In another interview with Wen Wei Po, the minister stressed the city has to focus on both quality and quantity for tourism development.

 Kaylin Hsieh has become the third Hong Kong fencer in history to win a Grand Prix, after defeating world number six Nelli Differt in the women's epée final in Doha.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh, 23, beat the Estonian 15-7 on Monday for her first victory against the 34-year-old in six attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR fencer joins Olympic gold medallists Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong in winning a Grand Prix for Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh wrote on social media that she started the competition with a cold and struggled to find rhythm, but decided to try to fight through it to see how far she could go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes life throws challenges at you when you least expect it and you just have to find a way to push through," she wrote, calling her triumph an unforgettable moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This gold medal is not just a milestone for me. It's a reminder of the power of resilience and mindset."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh, currently ranked 28th in the world, last topped a podium in international competition in the under-17 World Championships in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  She snatched a bronze at the World Cup in Vancouver last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh represented the SAR in her Olympic debut in Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was an individual and team champion representing the University of Notre Dame in the US during the 2022 NCAA fencing tournament.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hospital Authority (HA) dietician told people to avoid festive fat traps and overeating during the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Registered dietitian Ivy Chua from the HA said people can order healthier dishes when they are having their reunion dinner at restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you really want to eat out, try to control the portion and the food choices you are having. For example, you can choose some better quality protein, something like  steamed fish is a really lower fat protein source,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  People can get rid of chicken skin, and avoid eating sauces to have a healthier diet, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chua also said people could select high-fibre food, like vegetables, so as to eat less meat.
  <br>
  <br>
  To avoid overeating before the main reunion dinner, Chua said people could have high-fibre snacks before the big meal.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also reminded citizens, especially diabetes patients and people who have high blood pressure and high blood lipids, not to have too many Chinese New Year cakes and deep-fried traditional snacks as they contain a lot of oil, salt and sugar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is a lot of food that is really high in calories, especially in fat and sugar. I'd recommend everyone to try limit their portion of the food, especially the traditional snacks, and actually they can find some healthier snacks to replace it,” Chua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chua suggested that people can make healthier snacks at home such as rice crackers, low calorie jelly with fruits, or plain popcorn with a little bit salt.
