    Kai Tak a favourite for latest light public housing

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Tak appeared to be a top choice as people put in applications on Monday for homes in the second phase of Hong Kong's light public housing scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Four projects in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun and Sheung Shui will provide more than 5,000 units, with monthly rents of between HK$860 and HK$3,270.
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful tenants will be able to move in from the fourth quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those putting in an application, Chaves, told RTHK that Kai Tak would be a convenient location for her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been waiting for the traditional public housing almost 11 years. I'm paying rent every month, and my savings are just going. [I currently live in] a subdivided unit and there are four units in all. But the rent is quite a bit, I pay HK$5,000 a month," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm retired. I'm 73. I thought I'd apply for this because of Kai Tak. I do a lot of church work, so Kai Tak is easy for me to access the church in Tsim Sha Tsui."
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Choi was also hoping to get a unit in Kai Tak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I live in Kam Sheung Road now and it's inconvenient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An applicant surnamed Ng also said Kai Tak was his choice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I chose Kai Tak. It's more convenient, cleaner, and more airy. I live in transitional housing in Chai Wan but the rent is just too expensive. It's around HK$3,000 a month," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government aims to build a total of about 30,000 light public flats by 2028 as a short-term measure for those waiting for traditional public units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful applicants under the first light public housing phase will be able to move into the temporary new homes in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok in March and June respectively.

    'HK$2 transport scheme should stay with limitations'
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1792879-20250224.htm

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The HK$2 scheme was originally introduced in 2012 for anyone aged 65 or above. It was expanded in 2022 to also cover those between 60 and 64. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792879_1_20250224084830.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan is widely expected to unveil measures to trim public expenditure when he delivers his latest Budget on Wednesday, with one of them being a possible adjustment to the HK$2 transport fares for people over 60.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who said his budget would present a plan to control spending, and increase revenue, has already said the scheme is not financially viable in the long run and that expenses are snowballing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the public who spoke to RTHK say they do not want to lose the scheme – which was introduced in 2012 and expanded in 2022 – but said they understood that things need to be adjusted when times are tight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim is among the 2.4 million or so beneficiaries of the scheme, who has been paying concessionary fares since turning 60 last May.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, I don't want the scheme to go away. It saves me a great deal a month every single month on transport. But I understand the dilemma and the fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm willing to compromise somehow in order to keep the scheme the way it is. There could be some compromise in terms of putting a limit on how much of an allowance you actually get."
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy-five year-old David also felt the welfare initiative should be adjusted to go with the times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole idea was for retired people to go out. But now, a lot of people are not retired 65. A lot of people are working full time and are taking advantage of this, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At this moment, the Hong Kong government is in a lot of deficit. They're not rich as they used to be. So when you don't have the money, you should consider cutting your expense."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government reimbursed HK$4 billion to public transport operators in the previous financial year. That figure could shoot up to six billion dollars this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even as the expenditure balloons, unionist lawmaker Bill Tang said the scheme needs to stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think the $2 scheme is very, very positive for elderly or disabled [people's] welfare. it's beneficial to release their workforce, not only to employment, but also help to take care of their relatives, more support to the family,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang suggested an incremental bus fare system so that passengers who hop off after only a few stops pay a fraction of the full fare. He said that would lessen the government's burden in terms of the reimbursement amount.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB also opposed any changes to the scheme, saying its expenditure is a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated deficit of HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance (BPA) proposed raising the concessionary fare to HK$3 or HK$4, to align with inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  BPA lawmaker Priscilla Leung also suggested setting a cap on the transport subsidy each beneficiary can get.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not agree to cancel a particular sector who are enjoying the scheme right now, including the age span from 60 to 64. We just need to set up a very clear scheme, for example, they may only use two times per day. So they will use it out of necessity,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker Gary Zhang, meanwhile, is calling for a cautious approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged authorities to hold off drastic changes until analysing data such as people's travel patterns.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Team Hong Kong, China put up a strong fight but fell short against Jiangsu, as they missed out on gold at a men's handball tournament at Kai Tak Arena.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day tournament, featuring Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau, and Hong Kong, wrapped up on Sunday. It also served as a test event for the National Games in November, when the city will host handball and seven other competition events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite raucous support from the home crowd, the SAR found themselves on the back foot against the onslaught of Jiangsu players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides traded goals early on, but the visitors took a 15-9 lead at the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, Team Hong Kong, China ramped up their offensive play, closing the gap to just three at one point. However, their rally fizzled out as Jiangsu came away 28-20 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the earlier bronze medal match, Guangdong dominated Macau, China wire to wire. Guangdong jumped to a 20-10 lead at halftime, and pulled away for a final score of 42-20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, the head of Hong Kong's National Games Coordination Office, said more than 2,800 spectators attended the matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed revealed another test event has been scheduled next weekend -- the triathlon at the Central waterfront.

    Romantic Warrior claims second in close Saudi Cup race

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior has come up just short in winning the world's most lucrative race, galloping to second in an epic finish against Japan's Forever Young in the US$20 million Saudi Cup in Riyadh.
 <br>
  <br>
  Romantic Warrior – the highest-earning racehorse of all time – turned up at the Saudi capital for the race in the early hours of Sunday, Hong Kong time, hoping to add to the US$23 million already in the bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seven-year-old horse led the pack until the final 50 metres of the race, when the Japanese dirt star rallied to surge ahead in a nail-biting finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marked the first loss for Romantic Warrior since the Turnbull Stakes at Flemington in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the Hong Kong-trained horse collected US$3.5 million for finishing second.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was gallant in defeat. We had a great pitch in behind and he got a little bit of kickback, so I thought I'll get him into clear air and he made ground just beautifully. He went through his paces really nicely all the way to the line and I can safely say I wasn't stopping. I did not alter my stride pace at all," said superstar jockey James McDonald.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, I'm gutted he got beaten ... but he went down on his sword that's for sure and made one hell of a race out of it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trainer Danny Shum, for his part, called the performance "a good run", noting Romantic Warrior was only beaten by a head.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all did our best. I hope to win every time, but racing is racing. As long as he tries his best and it's a really good race – I think most of the people enjoyed the race," said Shum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The champion galloper is set to next tackle the 1,800-metre Group One Dubai Turf in April.

 Hong Kong Children's Hospital will strive to resume services for its ear, nose and throat, or ENT, department by the second half of this year, according to the head of the Hospital Authority.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kai Tak institution earlier suspended operations of the ENT department due to a manpower shortage. More than 500 patients were redirected to other public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, the authority's chief executive Tony Ko said that staff resignations were stabilising.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Usually there are only around 10 staff members from each hospital department, and less at the Children's Hospital. So when several staff members [from the ENT department] resigned within a short period of time at Children's Hospital ... operations had to be suspended," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, the overall resignation numbers are stabilising, and staff numbers are slowly recovering."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko also pledged to boost ENT services in different ways. These include encouraging medical staff outside the speciality to take care of less complicated cases, and allowing non-locally trained doctors to assist in cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, he said the authority is prepared for a budget cut in view of the government's fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, through drugs and medical equipment procurement, we have been purchasing from more places such as the mainland. This helped us reduce our costs. In terms of efficiency, our colleagues are able to work more smoothly and see more patients with the help of technology," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are seeing initial results."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko said the authority is also seeking to implement within six months dozens of recommendations set out by a committee tasked to systemically review public hospital operations and facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the suggestions are enhancing top-level oversight for quality and safety incidents, and introducing a reward-and-penalty staff assessment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether such measures would affect morale, Ko said the ultimate aim of the review is to help both staff and patients.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has said Wednesday's budget will detail the government's fiscal consolidation strategies, while revealing the colour of choice for his upcoming blueprint.
 <br>
  <br>
  On his official blog, the finance chief said on Sunday the administration would strictly control its spending, increase revenue appropriately, and make use of public resources and market forces to further boost development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the aqua-coloured cover of the budget reflected the unlimited opportunities presented in future developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is infinite vitality in a beautiful lake. Despite the occasional storms, we have firm confidence and positive expectations for the future given the solid backing of the country and the joint efforts of all sectors in Hong Kong," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also expressed gratitude to those who gave their suggestions during the budget consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan will announce his latest budget on February 26, amid an estimated deficit of HK$100 billion for the financial year ending March 31.

 Officials said the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday morning proceeded smoothly, but a review will still go ahead for to identify areas of improvement for the upcoming National Games later this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The cross-boundary race which began and ended in Shenzhen while passing through Hong Kong also served as a test event for the 15th National Games marathon later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-eight athletes from various provinces and cities participated, including three male and three female runners from Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhao Chaochuan, from Yunnan, won the men's race in two hours, 17 minutes and 15 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's Wan Cheuk-hei was the first man from the SAR to cross the line, clocking a time of of two hours and 33 minutes for eighth overall. He described the whole experience as special.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter if we were running against the wind or there were many slopes, it was still a very special route. We are fortunate to be running it for the first time. We don't know for sure if this will be the exact path for the Games, but I thought the arrangements were ideal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the women's side, Guangzhou's Chen Liqin clinched gold in two hours, 44 minutes and 44 seconds. The SAR's Leanne Szeto, at some two minutes behind, also finished on the podium with a bronze.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There have been marathon events for three consecutive weeks, with this race being the third one, so my feet are starting to get tired. I also feel a bit mentally fatigued from running. I was a little dizzy earlier, but overall it went smoothly. I didn't push myself too hard," Szeto said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, head of the SAR's National Games Coordination Office, said the test event ran smoothly and gave Hong Kong marshals valuable experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that officials would conduct a review into all aspects of the race ahead of the Games later this November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will consult with the athletes, coaches and other experts to see which aspects of the race needs to be optimised or adjusted. However, we can see that the track's width, curves and incline on the Hong Kong course is suitable for the event. Nonetheless, this will need further review later on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of the cross-boundary marathon took place on Hong Kong's roads. Starting at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre, runners entered the SAR via the Shenzhen Bay Port, before traversing the Shenzhen Bay Bridge and Kong Sham Western Highway viaduct, and returning via the same route.

    'All views on regulating ride-hailing welcomed'

<div class="itemFullText">
 All ideas on how officials can regulate online ride-hailing platforms in Hong Kong are welcomed, says the head of a government advisory body spearheading an industry review.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Cheung, who chairs the Transport Advisory Committee, also stressed the importance of finding common ground between the taxi trade and ride-hailing operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body and transport officials had heard the views of more than 20 representatives from the taxi trade -- as well as five ride-hailing operators -- in separate meetings last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The committee pledged to put forward a proposal on regulating car-sharing platforms to the administration within this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have committed to the stakeholders that [whenever] they have opinions, not only they can express their view to us during the meetings, they can [also] submit their opinion in written form any time they want," Cheung said after appearing on a radio programme on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if they meet me on the streets, in whatever occasion they meet me, they can tell me what they think. This is an ongoing consultation process."
  <br>
  <br>
  As to potential adjustments to the HK$2 transport fare concessionary scheme for residents aged 60 or above, Cheung said he's open to all suggestions to "reduce the wastage" amid a budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he threw his weight behind the scheme's objective.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any policy that encourages people to use our public transportation, to move across town, I think is a good policy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, officials are considering to cap the number of trips at eight per day for users, who will also receive an 80 percent discount on fares exceeding HK$10 -- more than the flat fare of HK$2 they're now paying on all trips.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Athletes participating in a handball test event for the National Games on Saturday said they were happy with the atmosphere and facilities at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men's handball test event is underway at the Kai Tak Arena over Saturday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The competing teams are Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau and Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang Quan, a handballer from the Jiangsu team, said the arena is comparable to those in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this venue is very professional. Since I have played in Europe before, I find that the lighting and flooring here are very similar to those in Europe - basically the same level," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong men's handball team captain Freddie Tse said the venue arrangements were first-class, rating them 9 out of 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very excited and amazed. It's my first time at Hong Kong's home court, and it's rare to hear our own language. You can see that the spectators are our family and friends. Even the people around us – it feels so familiar," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang Peijie from the Guangdong handball team, meanwhile, said the atmosphere was excellent and players were eager to compete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some spectators told RTHK they were there to support the SAR team and looked forward to watching the actual Games in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I play handball myself, that's why I follow this sport closely. I hope more people will get to know this sport. I want to see the Hong Kong team's techniques and learn a move or two," said a spectator.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the match between Jiangsu and Guangdong, Jiangsu led by four points at half-time and managed to secure a spot in the final with a 29-23 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team, meanwhile, also made the final after beating Macau 33-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final between Jiangsu and Hong Kong will be staged at the Kai Tak Arena on Sunday afternoon.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's deputies to the National People's Congress from the DAB party said on Saturday that they will propose expanding the multi-entry visa scheme to include more cities in the Greater Bay Area, or even first-tier cities, at the Two Sessions meeting in Beijing early next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was among the more than 40 suggestions the party plans to table to the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme was recently restored to cover Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party pointed out that expanding the coverage could help boost tourism development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, the SAR's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature noted that it is crucial for Hong Kong to open up to new markets, and the commercial sector, in particular, should get ready to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they are more flexible in facing all these challenges and they are in a more capable position to open up new markets. Therefore I hope that different chambers and trade associations can join hands together to open up more new markets," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In return, if we have more new markets, we can also bring more talent, investment and technology to our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said she will also propose that the central government set up a "housing purchase fund" to help talents from the mainland to settle in the SAR.

    Mixed reactions over rumoured changes to HK$2 scheme

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have mixed reactions towards the rumoured changes on the HK$2 fare concessionary scheme for the elderly.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, officials are mulling to impose a cap of eight trips per day for citizens aged 60 or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's thought while the fare stays at HK$2 for public transport rides costing HK$10 or less, the government would provide an 80 percent discount when the standard fare is above HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bill Tang welcomed the rumoured amendment, and believes it could help solve the bottomless subsidy pit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it would affect two types of people, for those who have to pay more - One is those who go to work everyday. I think they can afford the fare increment from HK$2 to HK$3 or HK$4," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The other is those who have to travel across multiple districts to take care of their grandchildren."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker hopes the government could review the threshold of HK$10 should transportation fares continue to rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable legislator Michael Tien said he would also welcome the rumoured changes, adding that it would be better than increasing the HK$2 fare itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The benefit of that is that it sets a mechanism, so that it automatically adjusts itself for the next 100, 200 years, rather than arguing about when they have to change that again," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Changing it into a percentage would be the best thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tik Chi-yuen from Third Side, on the other hand, believed that the rumoured amendment would not have a significant impact in reducing government expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on our observations, very few elderly take eight trips per day," he told reporters after a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  If only a few people take more than eight journeys, economically, the measure has no impact. But this will cause unease among the public and it's unnecessary."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen Bay Port will suspend its clearance services on Sunday for the cross-boundary marathon test event of the National Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The port will be closed from 2am to 11am, with no passengers or vehicles allowed during this period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The closure also affects the Shenzhen Bay Bridge, Kong Sham Western Highway and Ha Tsuen Interchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cross-boundary coach services, franchised buses, minibuses and taxis via the port will also be suspended during the time frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Travellers are advised to use alternative control points, including Lok Ma Chau, Heung Yuen Wai, and Man Kam To.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department recommended using the East Rail Line or taking KMB routes B1 and B9 to reach these checkpoints.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Passengers [should] use public transport services as much as possible and avoid driving to cross boundary ports during the test event period to avoid traffic congestion and unnecessary delays," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong section of the marathon is about 21 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cultural and tourism minister Rosanna Law on Saturday said officials are working with police to combat ticket scalping for the Kai Tak Sports Park opening next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Despite a real-name registration system, some people have been reselling tickets online for the star-studded event at prices far beyond HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Law called on members of the public to stay vigilant against scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you try to buy tickets above face value or buy from scalpers, you will only encourage more scalping activities," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since we have broadcasts on four TV channels, there's no need to scramble for these tickets that come from unknown sources and could even be fake."
  <br>
  <br>
  People will have to exchange their electronic vouchers for physical tickets at the Kai Tak Arena on February 27, 28 or the event day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cultural minister said officials will keep pursuing additional guests for the ceremony on March 1, which features athletes, singers and performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said she's confident about crowd management on the show day, noting that 80 percent of spectators were able to leave on the first MTR train after two major Kai Tak drills.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the tourism chief expects next week's budget speech to reveal this year's visitor forecast, which she thinks will exceed last year's numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, visitor arrivals reached 45 million. With more spectacular mega events this year like the giant pandas and the Kai Tak Sports Park opening, I expect visitor numbers to rise further. But we've mentioned that we're not just pursuing quantity but also quality," she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sensation caused by the mainland blockbuster Ne Zha 2 is very much a "lightning in a bottle-style success" which may not be easy to replicate, according to a local film critic.
 <br>
  <br>
  The animated film, based on the mythological character from Chinese folklore, hits the big screens in Hong Kong on Saturday, after smashing box office records on the mainland and abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think what director Yang Yu has done is taking an ancient property, something that every Chinese is intensely familiar with, to fiddle around with it for modern audiences," said Elizabeth Kerr, a Hong Kong-based film critic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/trendingchina" target="_blank">
   <u>
    RTHK's Trending China programme
   </u>
  </a>
  , she felt the film was a breath of fresh air as the same mythological legends are featured again and again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best part about the Ne Zha film is that they're not 'A Journey to the West', they're not 'Monkey King', which I understand that it is beloved ... [But] there's so much more that you can choose from," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a kind of strange territory for overseas viewers, for people who know nothing about any of the culture on this side of the world, it's going to be fresh to them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sequel to the 2019 hit Ne Zha smashed box office records on the mainland just two weeks after its release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film went on to dethrone Disney's "Inside Out 2" as the highest-grossing animated movie of all time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerr believes the sequel's more sophisticated and refined visual effects attributed to its success.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she struck a cautious tone over the film's release in the US market, saying it may not replicate the kind of success seen for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Oscar-winning martial arts epic in 2000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Partially because Crouching Tiger had a wider release. It also had considerable movie stars in it, and a powerhouse distributor pushing it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she insisted Ne Zha 2's value should not be solely judged by its box office revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ne Zha 2 is one of those things that is very much lightning in a bottle. People will try and repeat it. But you can't force it because how it happened was organic - no one will ever be able to tell you why this worked for this year, at this time, in this country, why it succeeded, no one can."

  She also hoped Ne Zha's success will encourage mainland filmmakers to experiment with different varieties of scripts, and be willing to "roll the dice" more.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A long-standing construction firm, Paul Y. Engineering Group, on Friday had its provisional liquidation application approved by the court.
 <br>
  <br>
  The High Court has now appointed a provisional liquidator for Paul Y's five subsidiaries to handle debts and formulate a restructuring plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said while the 78-year-old company is undertaking a number of public works projects, the impact of the formerly-listed firm's situation should be manageable.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the company is currently working on 13 public works projects -- all but one of them were undertaken by way of joint venture with other construction companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Y is also responsible for a number of projects for other public organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the majority of the contracts are undertaken by joint ventures, regardless of whether Paul Y is liquidated eventually, the other participants of the joint venture contracts must complete the remaining works in accordance with the contract requirements," authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some public sector owners, the government noted, have already replaced the main contractor of projects, for which the indebted firm was the sole undertaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson added that the administration has been paying close attention and taking measures to lower the impact on relevant projects and subcontractors, while helping affected workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Y had built numerous public and private housing projects, as well as landmark buildings such as The Center and the Hong Kong Club Building in Central.

    Journey cap, reduced discounts mulled for HK$2 scheme

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s HK$2 subsidised bus, train, ferry, minibus and tram fares for the over 60s could be curbed, sources say, with expensive journeys costing more and a daily limit on how many discounted trips can be made.
 <br>
  <br>
  It's thought the government is mulling a daily cap of eight trips, while discounts of 80 percent will be provided when the standard fare is above HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, a HK$20 standard fare would cost HK$4 once the subsidy is applied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials are not thought to be planning to raise the age when people can start enjoying the cheaper fares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan said earlier that there is broad public agreement that the HK$2 scheme must be changed as it is not financially sustainable in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme is expected to have cost some HK$6 billion in the 2024/25 financial year, a jump of around 50 percent from the year before.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Society for Immunisations and Travel Medicine on Friday said Hong Kong people should take different jabs, in accordance with their travel destinations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The society interviewed over 100 people this month, and found that 85 percent of them would not get jabbed, even if they were going to high-risk places.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president, Alex Leung, urged people to have a health consultation four to six weeks before their departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Travel health is not just about vaccination, it's about the whole package of travel health risk assessment. It's about what is the chemoprophylaxis... emergency medications," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said, for example, there are currently pneumonia outbreaks in Indonesia and the Philippines, while places like Japan, South Korea and Thailand recorded outbreaks of flu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infectious diseases expert Ivan Hung said having flu and pneumococcal infections at the same time is very common, and it may increase the possibility of hospitalisation and the death of patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pneumococcal disease... which previously [was] not believed to be a traveller's disease, is now being highlighted that certain people will have this risk of acquiring this kind of infection and developing complications," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society said people can refer to its vaccine guidelines, targeting popular destinations among Hong Kong travellers.

    Citybus unveils panda-themed open-top bus

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourists, bus enthusiasts and panda-lovers are being invited to take a ride on an open-top double-decker set to ply sightseeing routes in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Citybus on Friday introduced a newly re-painted vehicle featuring the six pandas living in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bus will be used on five sightseeing routes, including two new ones to be launched on March 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  For less than HK$50, travellers can go to tourism hotspots such as Repulse Bay and Aberdeen, or travel on the existing lines between Tsim Sha Tsui, Central and West Kowloon Cultural District.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan said the bus company has worked with Southern District Council, Ocean Park and community groups to come up with the new routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only will the bus take passengers around, those on board can also feel they're on a lively, cute and happy giant panda bus, which will blend into the scenery of different districts," she said at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This not only puts into practice 'tourism everywhere', it's also 'pandas everywhere'. This injects a dose of vibrancy into different areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said that last year, the company's open-top bus routes carried around 560,000 passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The managing director of Citybus, Richard Hall, said the new routes offer stunning views around Hong Kong's shorelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These two new routes will run along the dramatic coastline of Hong Kong Island, including the famous Victoria Harbour, the iconic beaches surrounding Southern District, with the incredible sunsets to be seen along the shoreline," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said it might paint pandas on more of its buses in future, depending on demand.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The vice-chancellor of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Friday said the institution would shoulder the financial challenges with the SAR amid a potential funding cut to the education sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan earlier hinted there was room to reduce education spending with a public deficit of HK$100 billion, pointing to substantial reserves of local universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a media luncheon, Zhang Xiang said he hopes any spending cuts would be moderate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a responsible community member, HKU will shoulder with the community, we will all together face this challenge,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We also hope that the government's financial cuts to the higher education will be moderate so we can survive.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said that while HKU has reserves which it built up over 100 years, much of this money has already been earmarked for future projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are building many buildings, more than 10 buildings on campus. This itself is multi-billion dollars already earmarked for this,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKU head added that a large portion of reserves consist of endowment funds from donors that support professorships.

    Lawmakers support tram fare increases

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Many lawmakers on Thursday voiced support for an increase in tram fares, with Hong Kong Tramways saying it needs the rises to stay afloat.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company hopes to put up fares by 30 cents to HK$3.30 for over 12s, by 10 cents to HK$1.60 for children aged 3 to 11, and by 20 cents to HK$1.50 for senior citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Managing director Paul Tirvaudey told lawmakers at a transport panel meeting that the firm does not expect passenger numbers to return to pre-Covid levels because of structural changes to the population and economic activities on Hong Kong Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong Tramways is at the same time very resilient, as it has been profitable in 120 years of existence. But at the same time, it is also still fragile with several critical risks which if not addressed properly, could threaten its long term viability,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So our ambition at the moment is to keep consolidating Hong Kong Tramways in the long term, for it to contribute even more to the attractiveness of Hong Kong and to the quality of life of its residents.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Legislator Gary Zhang, who supported the fare increase proposal, asked if the company could work on "smart driving", to improve efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tirvaudey said the company has been looking into this, for example by installing more cameras on trams for investigations and training.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the most advanced technologies, we had some tests. However, the difficulty would be to extend, to generalise these kind of technologies to 165 trams,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our fleet is quite large, and in terms of cost efficiency, it could still be very expensive compared to the benefits. So the return on investment has not been proven at the moment, but this is something that we closely monitor.”

 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law on Friday said a recording of the opening ceremony for Kai Tak Sports Park will be aired after editing in order to provide the best viewer experience.
 <br>
  <br>
  The opening show will be held at 6.30pm on March 1. It will be shown by four TV channels at 9.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Law stressed that the arrangement is not due to technical constraints, but is to coordinate the transition between different scenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to air the programme in one go, so viewers can enjoy a packed programme. After having many considerations, we think going for post-production is better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about claims that post-production demonstrates a lack of professionalism, the minister said there are many ways to show how magnificent and beautiful the sports park is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a strong performance line-up, and they have various collaborations and crossovers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law added that apart from the line-up already announced, including Hong Kong singers Joey Yung and MC Cheung, and fencing star Vivian Kong, special guests may also feature in the ceremony.

 The 8,500 tickets available for Kai Tak Sports Park's opening ceremony next month were snapped up within around half an hour of going on sale on Friday morning.

  Buyers need to collect their tickets at the park on February 27, 28, or the day itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cantopop diva Joey Yung, singer MC Cheung, movie star Donnie Yen, retired gold medallist fencer Vivian Kong and some mainland sports stars will be among those at the opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be no live broadcast for the 6.30pm show, but a recording will be aired by RTHK, TVB, ViuTV and HOY TV at 9.30pm.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A four-day conference aimed at promoting the importance of sports law and arbitration is currently underway in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Law Society, the symposium – called the 2025 Sports Law Mega Event – explores the connection between sports, law, and business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from Thursday and lasting until Sunday, a number of activities will be held with the goal of facilitating exchange between lawyers and visiting guests.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This conference is all about how sports law can create opportunities for Hong Kong’s legal and sports industries,” the president of the Law Society, Roden Tong, told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He explained that the conference will cover a number of areas, including broadcasting rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We even have e-sports specialists actually in one of the sessions,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung had revealed earlier this month that the pilot scheme for sports dispute resolution will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea was first unveiled in the Policy Address last year with the aim of promoting sports arbitration, which Tong said is currently not a common method of solving disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What we see now is the global sports market is in fact booming, and with [this], there are more disputes, whether it’s about contracts, governance issues or competition-related matters,” Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe that a robust and efficient dispute resolution system is essential, particularly in sports.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Democratic Party on Thursday evening announced its intention to disband following a central committee meeting to discuss its future.
 <br>
  <br>
  But party chairman Lo Kin-hei said a general meeting would be held at a later date and the disbandment would only move ahead if 75 percent of attending members approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is a decision that we make based on our understanding of the current political situation and things like that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said he would chair a three-person working group to handle the initial preparations for the party's shutdown.

    'Wrong vaccines did not harm two affected kids'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health has apologised for mistakenly giving pneumococcal vaccines to two children who were supposed to get hepatitis B vaccinations at the Tin Shui Wai Maternal and Child Health Centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said there was no adverse reaction in the affected kids and paediatricians have assessed that the wrong vaccines do not pose any health risks to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven children, between one and seven months old, were scheduled to receive hepatitis B vaccines between 4pm and 5.30pm on Monday, the department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a routine check of vaccination records later that day found that two fewer doses of hepatitis B vaccine had been used and two extra doses of pneumococcal vaccine had been used.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said while investigations are ongoing it is believed the incident was due to human error, noting it had instructed the health centre to step up efforts in the training of frontline staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the nursing staff involved had been suspended from vaccination duties and disciplinary action would be taken if the probe confirms any misconduct.

    Remand, new prison admission numbers rise in 2024

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The average daily number of people in remand reached its highest in more than two decades while the number of new admissions to correctional institutions last year also rose, prison authorities said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  New prison admissions overall stood at 18,438 last year, up seven percent from the figure in 2023, according to the Correctional Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 3,600 people were remanded in custody on average per day over the past year – the highest figure since 2000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response to the ever-changing penal population, especially the increasing population of those in remand, the department has deployed part of the capacity of certain correctional institutions to admit those in remand, to alleviate the overcrowding situation of reception centres," said commissioner Wong Kwok-hing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delivering an annual round-up of the department's work, Wong also said authorities decided against introducing legal amendments to prevent people placed under supervision from leaving Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea was previously floated after former student activist Tony Chung allegedly violated his supervision order and went to Britain to seek political asylum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After discussing with the Department of Justice, we found that under current laws, we actually have enough power to impose some new supervisory conditions," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So since last year, we have implemented some arrangements for all those under supervision on applying to leave Hong Kong. They must apply to our supervisors before leaving Hong Kong, and they can only leave when we give approval."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifteen cases had been approved so far under the new rule, Wong added.

    8,500 tickets on offer for Kai Tak Sports Park opening

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Thursday that 8,500 tickets would be up for grabs for the opening ceremony of the Kai Tak Sports Park on March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tickets will be available starting at 10am on Friday through Urbtix on a first-come, first-served basis, and they will cost HK$10 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is among the total number of 33,600 seats available for the event, with the government and park operator each responsible for the distribution of 16,800 tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 8,000 tickets will be distributed for free to underprivileged families, charities and other district organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said while the show that starts at 6.30pm would not be broadcast live, the ceremony would be aired later in the evening by four TV channels at 9.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that overseas viewers could also enjoy the broadcast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For overseas viewers, I think they also can [watch] through the apps or through the channels of our different free TV channels... watch it together with the Hong Kong audience at 9.30pm at home in their countries or in their areas," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said although the park is able to live stream the event, the government decided not to do that because the broadcast version would be able to showcase the park’s facilities better.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singers, celebrities and athletes from Hong Kong and the mainland were among those slated to perform at the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law did not reveal how much the ceremony cost, but she said the government would spend its budget wisely.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have to give special thanks to all the participating artists and also athletes and performers, most of them actually do not require us to provide a special remuneration, aside from the minimum, for example the makeup or hair-do.”

    New light rail route to showcase gems of Tuen Mun

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 MTR bosses on Thursday unveiled a new "light rail sightseeing route" to take visitors on a tour of the delights of Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br>
  From February 22, six "Tuen Mun Voyager" trains will run in a circular route on weekends and public holidays. The journey will last about one hour and 15 minutes, although passengers can hop on and off at any of the 12 stops covered.
  <br>
  <br>
  A travel ambassador will be on board to tell passengers about the sights they can see.
  <br>
  <br>
  The railway company said it has come up with three different itineraries, one for food lovers, another for photography enthusiasts, and a third especially attractive to families.
  <br>
  <br>
  One highlight is Tuen Mun Ferry Pier, where the movie “Beyond the Dream” was filmed, while another is the seafood market near the Sam Shing stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeny Yeung, MTR’s Managing Director for Hong Kong Transport Services, said she hopes the new route will attract people to visit the district as part of the "tourism everywhere" concept.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tuen Mun is a charming place that not many Hong Kong people know. There are many beautiful landmarks, historical buildings and scenery,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through this sightseeing route, we hope to draw in locals and tourists to come to Tuen Mun and discover the gems here.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A one-day travel pass costs HK$50 and comes with HK$150 worth of vouchers.

    Handball National Games trials to be held this weekend

<img alt="Yeung Tak-keung said a series of trials for the National Games will take place in Hong Kong in the coming months. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792464_1_20250220161403.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong official who heads an office coordinating the upcoming National Games, Yeung Tak-keung, said he expects around 1,000 spectators to attend a handball tournament serving as a test event for the Games this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day event will take place at the Kai Tak Arena, and comes before the SAR hosts the nationwide sporting tournament with Guangdong and Macau for the first time this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung, who's the former sports commissioner, said on Thursday that workers at the Sports Park are ready after a series of trials in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials were making final adjustments for the tournament this weekend, such as making sure the changing rooms are fine as well as the lighting for the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because for handball, sometimes players need to lob the ball high when they go on a fast break. That means they will look up, so we have to adjust the angle of the lights, and how bright they are," Yeung told RTHK in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens in late March would also be a test event for the National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while it is the first time the mega event would take place at Kai Tak, Yeung doesn't expect much of a problem because the SAR has a wealth of experience in hosting it.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the test event for beach volleyball would be held around Easter on the football pitches at Victoria Park, and stalls would be set up nearby to promote Hong Kong culture to spectators.
  <br>
  <br>
  But before that, Yeung said officials want to bring something different for the two-day triathlon trial races starting from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, such events would take place along the harbourfront. But this time, besides having the cycling and running there, a segment of the track will be inside the space for events at the Central Harbourfront," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be stands for the spectators, and other areas for them, so they can be more comfortable, and get a close-up view of the athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said officials would also put up a giant screen in Central for a better viewing experience.

    Hospital doctors to use AI for medical reports

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Public hospital doctors will start using generative AI to help them draft medical reports from next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The technology will be used to summarise a patient's clinical data, including lab results, the Hospital Authority said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's chief executive, Tony Ko, said the introduction of AI is to save doctors time when preparing their reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  “All the reports have to be finally checked and authorised by the doctor himself, so the doctors will be responsible for the accuracy of the report that truly reflects his or her decision in terms of what the content is to be included in the report,” Ko said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said it will first test the system at Caritas Medical Centre, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Tin Shui Wai Hospital, Tseung Kwan O Hospital and United Christian Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also said that patients will soon be able to get copies of their medical reports via its HA Go app.

 The city's Ombudsman has urged housing authorities to speed up the turnover of recovered public rental flats, such as by shortening the period between taking back a home and issuing a refurbishment order.
 <br>
  <br>
  A probe by the watchdog revealed that it normally took around two and a half months for a home taken back by the Housing Department to be ready for its next tenants to move in, and nearly three months when the Housing Society carries out the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The procedures for the recovery of flats by the Housing Department and the Housing Society, and their arrangements for refurbishment and reallocation of recovered flats need further revamping, to speed up turnover of public housing flats and ensure optimal utilisation of precious public housing resources," Ombudsman Jack Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past five years, the Housing Department has recovered 15,700 public housing flats annually on average. The Housing Society, meanwhile, took back around 1,100 units each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have taken steps to expedite the refurbishment of recovered flats since the watchdog launched an investigation last year, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the Housing Department would issue a refurbishment works order within three days of a public housing tenant moving out, while the Housing Society set the period to within two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said in its report that the two-week period "might raise doubts among members of the public as to whether it is reasonable".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Housing Society] could bring forward the time for notifying the contractors to start work in the estate," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Housing Department over the past five years managed to refurbish each recovered flat in 43 days, which is in line with its target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninety percent of renovations of homes recovered by the Housing Society met the completion target of 60 days, but Chan said the body should carry out a "comprehensive review" to cut down the refurbishment period.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Housing Department pledged to review and study the recommendations in detail to allocate public housing flats to those in need as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department also noted that it has previously looked into introducing measures such as making sure public housing applicants can move in once the refurbishment of their new home is completed.

    Legco gives green light to lower Tai Lam Tunnel tolls

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Thursday approved plans for lower toll fees at the Tai Lam Tunnel when it comes under government control at the end of May.
 <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles will be charged HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during regular periods, and HK$18 at quiet times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tolls for commercial vehicles such as trucks and buses will fall from as high as HK$79 to HK$43 at any time of day, while taxis will be charged HK$28 – less than half the current HK$58 fee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien had proposed making the tunnel free for private cars, motorbikes and commercial vehicles during non-peak hours, but this was rejected by the council, with concerns raised about lost revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel, which stretches between Ting Kau and Yuen Long, is currently owned by a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai Properties. Its 30-year franchise began in 1995.

    Taxi, ride-hailing rivalry to intensify: expert

<img alt="Timothy Hau from the University of Hong Kong's Business School says there are more players entering the ride-hailing market. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792395_1_20250220085201.jpg&q=40">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport expert on Thursday said competition between the taxi industry and other ride-hailing services will heat up, after cabbies called off a five-day strike to give authorities more time to carry out enforcement action.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association had earlier threatened five days of industrial action from March 5, saying their business was seriously hurt by their unlicensed rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Wong Yu-ting, apologised after a meeting with transport officials for causing "unease" to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Timothy Hau from the University of Hong Kong's Business School told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  that the taxi drivers' “extreme" and "counterproductive” measures had angered the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[These measures] just make people madder and upset with them and dissatisfied with their services, which I must say is really getting increasingly worse."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hau noted that there are more players entering the ride-hailing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With Gaode entering the picture, and Tada more recently, we have a situation in which the government announced that within a year, they're going to regulate ride-hailing services...and so during this period, a lot of companies will come in and get their foot in the door,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They would want to ensure that they have a place once all the regulatory policies are issued…It’s going to be a fairly crowded market,” Hau added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi industry has said the government would submit a legislative proposal within this year to regulate ride hailing platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also expressed the hope that authorities would require ride-hailing service providers to attend professional training beforehand, and have their vehicles undergo inspections annually.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said they intercepted eight private cars in a citywide undercover operation targeting illegal ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eight drivers, aged between 36 and 63, were suspected of using their cars for illegal hire or reward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three vehicles were seized for further investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police will continue to deploy manpower based on operational priorities to combat illegal vehicle hire or reward activities," said Cheng Ho-ming, a senior inspector with the force.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officer did not reveal whether the eight drivers were arrested, and which ride-hailing platforms were involved.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing commerce official on Wednesday pledged further support for Hong Kong under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), the city's free-trade deal with the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fan Shijie, the director-general of the Commerce Ministry's Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, told a forum that the central government is committed to backing the city's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will, under the CEPA framework, continue to promote opening up and cooperation with Hong Kong, and support Hong Kong to better integrate into national development," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support different departments in implementing preferential measures under CEPA, and will continue to strengthen opening up and cooperation under the agreement to support investors in Hong Kong and around the world to enter the mainland via Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  An agreement signed last year between the two sides to amend the framework on trade in services under CEPA will come into effect next month. Changes include removing or loosening restrictions on equity shareholding and business scope across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maggie Wong, Hong Kong's permanent secretary for commerce and economic development, said the changes are beneficial to sectors such as financial services, telecommunications, and tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government will make the trade make good use of a number of preferential measures, and will continue to seek to jointly promote a higher level of opening up and closer economic and trade cooperation with the mainland on the basis of CEPA, so as to maximise the space of development for the trade on the mainland," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration must take measures to defend free trade amid challenges posed by unilateralism and protectionism, the official added.

 The Polytechnic University of Hong Kong (PolyU) is willing to stand with the government amid potential funding cuts, the institution's council head said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Education officials earlier said the University Grants Committee will adjust funding for the territory’s eight universities due to a significant government deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Tai-fai, chairman of PolyU’s council, told a media gathering that such cuts would definitely affect the university, and the institution is looking at ways to reduce expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  That said, he stressed the university will continue to push ahead with its development plans and recruitment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, PolyU's president, Jin-Guang Teng, said the university is working on a proposal to set up Hong Kong's third medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university has many years of experience in offering medical-related courses with hundreds and thousands of graduates, Teng said, adding that he believes PolyU has what it takes to establish a medical school.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday proposed amendments to the Trade Unions Ordinance to improve the regulatory regime and better safeguard national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the changes, the Registrar of Trade Unions could reject new registrations or amalgamations on national security grounds, with no appeal allowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  People convicted of national security offences would be barred from becoming trade union officers or promoters, and unions would be banned from joining any external political organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In order to join a non-political group outside the SAR, trade unions would have to obtain approval from the chief executive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unions would also have to apply to the registrar before receiving any external funds, and any approved funds could not be used for local elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also said the amendments protect employees' right and freedom to form and join trade unions in accordance with the Basic Law, the Bill of Rights Ordinance and relevant international conventions.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[The amendments] definitely won’t hinder the development of trade unions. They will even promote a healthier development of Hong Kong's trade unions,” said Deputy Commissioner for Labour Raymond Ho.
  <br>
  <br>
  The amendments are to be tabled to the Legislative Council in April.

    Man to be charged over suspicious SMS messages

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said that a man had been arrested on suspicion of scamming people by sending phishing text messages that start with a hashtag.
 <br>
  <br>
  A little more than a year ago, authorities introduced a scheme under which registered firms and organisations can send messages that start with the symbol, in a bid to combat scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said officers received around 30 reports in the past week about suspected fraud messages with the hashtag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers then arrested the suspect, 23, on Monday, and plan to lay charges against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After careful planning, officers arrested the man in Mong Kok on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud," said senior inspector Wan Chun-hong from the police's Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The suspect was inside a van, and police seized two mobile phones and a radio jammer that was in operation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wan said at a police briefing that one victim claimed to have lost around HK$22,000 after clicking a hyperlink from a suspicious text message and giving out credit card information.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Communications Authority said they found that some of the recent suspicious hashtag messages were not sent out by local telecommunication firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal regulatory affairs manager Andrew Lo said people should be extra careful when they see their phone signal dip suddenly from maximum coverage to 2G, as messages they receive during that period could be from people using illicit radio jammers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The jammers would pretend to be a 2G base station, because under this standard, mobile phones generally won't authenticate the 2G station," he said at the same briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it's possible to deceive these phones, connect to their network and send fraudulent messages to them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo added that extra caution is also needed when the messages involve strange hyperlinks, or that they ask for money.

 Ride-sharing operators and the taxi trade can coexist under a "balanced and sustainable" framework on regulating car-hailing services, Uber's boss in Hong Kong said on Wednesday.

  Estyn Chung, Uber Hong Kong’s general manager, also said he's hopeful for further exchanges with the government and the taxi industry.

  "We believe that a balanced and sustainable regulatory framework will allow taxis and ride-sharing to co-exist for the benefit of all Hongkongers, for Hongkongers to have more choice when it comes to point-to-point transportation," Chung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe it's really important to protect the flexibility and earnings opportunity of drivers, and also to protect the safety and service quality for all Hongkongers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Representatives from Uber attended an afternoon meeting with government officials to share their views on regulating ride-hailing platforms in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, taxi industry representatives held talks with transport authorities before deciding to call off a planned strike to push for a crackdown on illegal ride-hailing services in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is seeking to introduce a regulatory framework to the Legislative Council on ride-sharing platforms, with authorities stressing illegal services would not be tolerated.

    Taxi trade calls off strike, apologises to public

<div class="itemFullText">
 The taxi industry has called off a strike next month to push for a crackdown on illegal ride-hailing services, after meeting with transport officials on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association had earlier threatened five days of industrial action from March 5, saying their business was seriously hurt by their unlicensed rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Wong Yu-ting, apologised after the meeting for causing "unease" to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added authorities should be given time to take enforcement action, so a strike was no longer necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong maintained the government should take action against ride-hailing service providers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of arrestees (ride-hailing drivers) is actually not the top priority. Most importantly, they should take immediate action to prosecute the drivers, so as to deter others from doing so," Wong told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi Council, described the meeting as positive and constructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would submit a legislative proposal within this year to regulate ride hailing platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ride-hailing platforms must ensure all the vehicles hailed from their platforms must have legal licence," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hoped the government would require ride-hailing service providers to attend professional training beforehand, and have their vehicles undergo inspections annually.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Commissioner Angela Lee said the government was looking at next steps.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is now studying with the Department of Justice on fine-tuning existing laws to optimise the enforcement process," she added.

<img alt="Peter Lam will begin his term on April 1. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792261_3_20250219142136.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has reappointed Peter Lam as the chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) for a three-year term.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam, who succeeds Pang Yiu-kai, will begin his term on April 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The businessman also served as the board's chairman between 2013 and 2019, before passing the reins to Pang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said in a statement that Lam's diverse experience in business management and public services makes him the best candidate for the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident that under Dr Lam's leadership, the board will advance further while promoting Hong Kong worldwide and showcasing its charms, so that visitors will indulge in pleasure when staying in Hong Kong, thinking about Hong Kong, and returning time and again," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also currently serves as the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, a position that will soon be handed over to former commerce chief Frederick Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law expressed gratitude to Pang for his leadership in navigating the numerous challenges posed by the Covid pandemic and for spearheading the recovery of Hong Kong's tourism industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTB added that under Pang's leadership, Hong Kong welcomed nearly 45 million visitors in 2024, solidifying its status as a premier destination for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions tourism, cruises and overall tourism, while serving as a crucial gateway for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pang said it has been a privilege to serve the community over the past six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very grateful to the government, the travel trade, my fellow HKTB members and the team for the support they have given me throughout the years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will continue to work closely with HKTB team to promote ‘Hong Kong Super March’ and fully support the work of HKTB going forward. I wish HKTB and Dr Lam every success.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has also appointed Jeffrey Lam, Nikki Ng and Melissa Pang as new members of the board.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has appointed former commerce chief Frederick Ma as the new chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, succeeding Peter Lam.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ma's two-year term will run from June 1, 2025 to May 31, 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said in a statement that Ma’s extensive experience in public service and the commercial sector makes him well-suited for the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident that he will lead the HKTDC to make every effort in assisting enterprises to embrace the challenges arising from the ever changing global trading landscape and actively tap new markets and business opportunities, with a view to further promoting Hong Kong's development as an international trade centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also thanked Lam for his contributions during his tenure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under his chairmanship, the HKTDC has successfully promoted Hong Kong as a two way global investment and business hub and assisted Hong Kong companies in further exploring the business opportunities in the mainland and overseas brought by the nation's dual circulation strategy, with outstanding achievements particularly in promoting Hong Kong in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and emerging markets under the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma currently serves as the non-executive chairman of the FWD Group and is a member of the Chief Executive’s Council of Advisers.

    'Ne Zha 2' to hit HK cinemas on Saturday

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Record-breaking blockbuster "Ne Zha 2" is set for general release in Hong Kong on Saturday, as it dethroned Disney's "Inside Out 2" and became the highest grossing animated film of all time -- based on domestic ticketing data.
 <br>
  <br>
  It premiered in the city on Tuesday night, after it garnered significant attention in the SAR over the past month, which saw the animated movie break records for the number of distributors and daily screenings for a mainland film in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are honoured to bring this world-class phenomenon-level animation to Hong Kong and Macau, allowing viewers to experience the charm of Ne Zha in the theatres," said a representative of Emperor Motion Pictures, which is a co-distributor of the film.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, some local fans went to Shenzhen to see the animation, ahead of its SAR release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen online comments about the animated film, saying it is a good and touching movie with an excellent storyline that's enlightening for viewers," said a Hongkonger who viewed the movie across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I specifically watched the first movie in Hong Kong and came today to watch its sequel here in Shenzhen, as it hasn't been screened in Hong Kong. I want to see what makes this animation so successful in attracting many adults and to learn about the latest development of Chinese animation."
  <br>
  <br>
  A sequel to the 2019 hit "Ne Zha 1", "Ne Zha 2" has already packed out cinemas in China, where it claimed the title of the nation's biggest box-office hit since its release last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media, citing ticketing platform, Maoyan, said on Tuesday the fantasy epic had raked in over 12.32 billion yuan (US$1.72 billion), which surpassed "Inside Out 2" that took US$1.7 billion following its release last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ne Zha 2" tells the tale of a rebellious young deity who uses his powers to battle formidable foes after his village is destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film was released overseas this month, sparking hopes that it would garner similar acclaim abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The original "Ne Zha" became what was then China's highest-grossing animated film, after it was released in 2019.

    More community pharmacies to be set up: Lo Chung-mau

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on Wednesday the government plans to establish up to five community pharmacies in each district, so patients can more easily get their medicine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Lo said through the Hospital Authority’s centralised procurement, patients and private doctors can get cheaper medicine for chronic and episodic illnesses at community pharmacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said community pharmacies will also help to reduce drug wastage as patients need not take home several months’ worth of medication.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With community pharmacies, citizens will not need to get months of medication at one time. They can get one month of medication after visiting the doctor,” Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They also don't need to have a monthly follow-up appointment to get the same medicine. Instead, they can go to a community pharmacy to fill a prescription,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister also expressed the hope that citizens would consult their own family doctors first for minor illnesses or chronic diseases. He added residents can select a general practitioner in their neighbourhood from a list of eligible doctors provided at District Health Centres (DHC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, there are seven DHCs in the city, located in Kwai Tsing, Sham Shui Po, Southern District, Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun, Wong Tai Sin and Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the government has subsidised family doctors in the community to provide screening services for diabetes and hypertension for eligible citizens.

<img alt="An HR expert says Hong Kong firms need to offer attractive pay to lure Islamic finance professionals to the SAR. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792212_1_20250219084656.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resources expert on Wednesday said the latest government move to expand Hong Kong's Talent List is the right one, and will help plug holes in the SAR's workforce.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, officials announced that aircraft maintenance engineers, accountants and financial professionals with Islamic market experience will be among nine professions added to the list from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, Hong Kong has a very serious shortage of these talents," Roy Ying, the co-chair of the advocacy and policy research committee at the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that aircraft engineering and maintenance firms such as Haeco has had to go overseas to recruit engineers all the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ying also said the government has been proactive in addressing the needs of employers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also think that the government is actively listening to the industries because these new jobs, they don't just land on the Talent List. It's a collaboration between the government and the industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously the government sees a serious shortage and that's why these [jobs] are added to the Talent List."
  <br>
  <br>
  On bringing in more Islamic finance professionals to the SAR, he said Hong Kong firms not only have to offer attractive pay in order to compete with market leaders Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, but the territory also has to be become more Muslim friendly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of halal restaurants, we only have about 132 in Hong Kong... and most organisations don't have prayer rooms, so we have to make our city a little more embracing to attract these people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't just want them to come, we want them to also bring their families... we have to get people who want to call Hong Kong home."

    HK's population grows by 6,400

<img alt="Hong Kong's population stood at 7.534 million at the end of 2024, representing an increase of 0.1 percent year on year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792151_2_20250218225030.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's population expanded for the third consecutive year, albeit at a slower pace, to 7.534 million last year, an uptick of 6,400.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 0.1 percent growth paled in comparison to the 0.7 percent increase in 2023, and one percent in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the 36,700 births last year were outstripped by 51,400 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was offset by a net positive movement of 21,000 SAR residents, which included 40,000 arrivals through one-way permits. Around 18,900 people migrated elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said that various talent attraction measures and labour importation schemes helped boost the city's population growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Professor Paul Yip from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Social Work and Social Administration struck a cautious tone.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that the natural decrease of over 14,000 people remained a concern, alongside the city's ageing population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we can see is that the ageing situation remains a very important issue and it will get worse in the coming years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip does not expect the trend to reverse any time soon, despite a 10 percent jump in the birth rate last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In 2024, that was the dragon year. It is a year that tends to have a higher birth rate than before. But I think when we look at the historical figures, all the years after the dragon years, I think the birth rates reduced accordingly," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The population expert urged the government to focus on improving people’s health and wellbeing, while encouraging enterprises to adopt technology to make work less labour intensive.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker legends Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan said they are very excited to play in their first tournament in Hong Kong since becoming SAR residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 will be held in the Kai Tak Arena on March 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Trump is set to face Gary Wilson of England, while O'Sullivan will take on Si Jiahui from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Trump and O'Sullivan obtained their Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it is more motivating to come back here because I feel like now that I'm here, and I feel like the people in Hong Kong can really get behind me and have someone to really support," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think when you have somebody that is trying to represent Hong Kong, which I am now. I think the people can kind of see that. I hope that comes off in the way that I'm able to carry myself and give everybody full respect. I hope to make Hong Kong proud and be the first winner of this tournament."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan, a seven-time World champion, said he is ready and looks forward to play in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said efforts are underway to make sure the event is being held successfully at the brand new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope the spectators will understand if something don't go right on the first day, we guarantee that we will try to our best to fix problems to make sure the tournament will run smoothly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Exhibition matches will also take place during the two-day event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's top player, Marco Fu, will face off the legendary "Whirlwind" Jimmy White on March 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's Ng On-yee, meanwhile, takes on world number 1 Mink Nutcharut from Thailand the following day.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained at 3.1 percent in the November-January period, unchanged from the previous three-month figure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Census and Statistics Department said 3,716,600 were in work in the latest period, a fall of 2,300 from October-December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour force, meanwhile, decreased by around 5,700 to 3,826,700.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 110,100 people were looking for a job, down about 3,500 from the previous three-month period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underemployment rate also remained unchanged in the three months from November, at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said Hong Kong's jobless rate remains low.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added in a statement that "the labour market should remain largely stable in the near term, though uncertainties in the global economy would continue to pose challenges to some businesses."

    Lawmakers back annual minimum wage reviews

<img alt="Hong Kong's statutory minimum wage will increase from HK$40 to HK$42.1 per hour. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792143_1_20250218174210.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers welcomed the shift from biennial to annual minimum wage reviews, saying this would enhance the quality of life of grassroots workers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's statutory minimum wage will increase from HK$40 to HK$42.1 an hour, following a 5.25 percent recommendation from the Minimum Wage Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  This new rate is set to take effect on May 1, pending lawmakers' approval, and will be reviewed annually instead of biennially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Chun-sing, chairman of the Legislative Council's manpower panel, said reviewing wages annually allows minimum wage workers to better pace their earnings with inflation each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK that the government's freeze on minimum wage levels during the pandemic led to four years without salary increases for grassroots workers despite inflation, severely affecting their ability to maintain their purchasing power and living standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam hopes future adjustments to the minimum wage would give greater weight to economic growth, so that workers could benefit more substantially from gains in the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that later ... after three or five years we can review the formula to see whether we can increase the proportion of the calculation of growth of the GDP so that if there's a large increase in GDP, then we can also have a large increase in minimum wage levels so that the grassroots worker can share the fruits of economic development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung, of the Federation of Trade Unions, said they would continue to communicate with the government to see whether a review could be conducted within five to 10 years after this reform was completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the increase was unlikely to have a major impact on the labour market, as only about 20,000 of the 3.6 million workers in the SAR earn the minimum wage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of grassroots workers is small and their roles are concentrated in cleaning and security. We have heard that many companies in these industries already pay wages above the minimum wage, meaning that this adjustment will not affect those already earning more than the minimum," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thus, we believe it will not have a major impact on the economy or competitiveness."

    Islamic finance among new additions to Talent List

<img alt="From March 1, the Talent List will cover 60 professions. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792146_1_20250218174805.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aircraft maintenance engineers, accountants and financial professionals with Islamic market experience will be among nine professions added to Hong Kong's Talent List from March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government also wants new blood with a background in commodities trading, as well as systems architects, patent professionals, ship surveyors, professionals in green shipping, and legal knowledge engineers in the legal and dispute resolution sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a closed-door media briefing on Tuesday, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said that by expanding the number of jobs on the list to 60, the government is hoping to find talented people who can add significant value to the economy in areas where there are staff shortages and where it is not practical to train up locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, it said requests from industries to add further roles to the list, including pilots and language therapists, have been rejected because there are sufficient training opportunities for local people to take up such jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in professions on the list get a smoother immigration process when applying to work in Hong Kong through various talent schemes, officials say.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last expansion of the Talent List was in May 2023, when the number of professions rose from 13 to 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said between May 2023 and the end of last year it received 1,123 applications for work visas involving jobs on the list.

    Rise in cigarette smuggling in 2024: customs
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cigarette smuggling accounted for around 68 percent of the total number of cases the Customs and Excise Department worked on last year, according to customs officers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department handled more than 31,000 cases in 2024, which was a 63 percent increase from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said cigarette smuggling increased 80 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs commissioner Chan Tsz-tat on Tuesday said the numbers were due to the increased tobacco tax over the past two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The duty rates of cigarettes has increased from HK$1.9 to HK$3.3 per stick over the past two years. Inevitably, this would add the incentive to smugglers as well as incoming passengers to bring in excessive duty-free cigarettes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the department had cracked 40 large-scale cigarette smuggling cases in 2024, similar to 2023, but the number of cigarettes seized dropped 33 percent to around 600 million sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the drop was due to syndicates decreasing the number of cigarettes being smuggled out at any one time and using differenct smuggling methods in order to reduce losses if smuggled products were seized.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, customs officers seized 6.3 tonnes of drugs and arrested 366 people last year in connection with these seizures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them, 19 cases involved the import of space oil drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs said it has stepped up its actions following the classification of etomidate, the key ingredient of the space oil drug, as a dangerous drug last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have strengthened our enforcement covering the whole supply chain, including import and export, distribution and retail, and to crack down on their supply," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The department has also enhanced intelligence analysis and risk management so as to ensure precise cargo and passenger selections. Etomidate has been added to the database of our Raman spectrometers to enhance detection on the front line," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ngong Ping 360 on Tuesday said it will work on attracting more long-haul tourists, as its visitor numbers last year surpassed pre-pandemic levels.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company said it received record-breaking cable car revenue of over HK$413 million last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the facility welcomed more than 1.5 million guests in 2024, showing a 10 percent growth when compared with pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 percent of the visitors were from short-haul markets, followed by mainland tourists, local people, and visitors from long-haul markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, managing director James Tung said the company will do its best to attract more visitors, especially those from long-haul markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are actually talking to some online travel agencies, trying to target those free and independent travellers - FIT - who may not necessarily follow a tour itinerary pattern, but they can get access to our tickets very easily,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So we are even targeting potentially backpackers from the US, from Australia, from Europe as well.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the Airport Authority unveiled the Airport City development blueprint, aiming to create a new landmark for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tung said the cable car facility has an advantage of being close to Chek Lap Kok.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve been talking to different operators, different stakeholders who are involved in the project, to see what we can do moving forward… how we can actually get the tickets to the hands of the travellers,“ he said.

 Hong Kong is set to raise the statutory minimum wage from the current HK$40 to HK$42.1 per hour.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement issued on Tuesday, the government said the Executive Council has adopted the recommendation of the Minimum Wage Commission (MWC) on raising the minimum wage level by 5.25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will publish the Minimum Wage Ordinance (Amendment of Schedule 3) Notice 2025 in the Gazette on Friday, and table it in the Legislative Council on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Legco gives it the green light, the new minimum wage rate will take effect on May 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The recommendation … is in line with the policy objectives … to maintain an appropriate balance between forestalling excessively low wages and minimising the loss of low-paid jobs, while giving due regard to sustaining Hong Kong's economic growth and competitiveness,” labour and welfare secretary Chris Sun said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park will mark a significant milestone in Hong Kong's sporting and cultural landscape.
 <br>
  <br>
  An opening ceremony will begin at 6.30pm on March 1, with a joint broadcast at 9.30pm across four free TV channels, rather than being shown live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the broadcast arrangements, Lee said he believes the production company has tried its best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to make sure that members of the public will be able to view the event for free through the TV channels so that we can share the happiness with everyone," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The production company will seek partners to help deal with all the challenges that they are going to face. In this regard I believe the production company has been working very hard. They're going to find the best solution within such a short period of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The park's opening is part of what is being billed as Hong Kong's "Super March", alongside Art Basel, ComplexCon, and the World Grand Prix snooker tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the mega events scheduled for the first half of this year are expected to attract 840,000 tourists and generate HK$3.3 billion in spending.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday urged the taxi industry to avoid "drastic action" such as strikes, warning such moves would harm the public interest and could be hijacked by people with bad motives.

  His comments came after the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association threatened a five-day strike from March 5 unless officials take immediate action against illegal ride-hailing services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said strikes would not be good for society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any drastic action is not going to solve the problem. Drastic action may also hurt the interests of normal citizens in the course of their daily going about of their lives. It is not going to receive public support," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted that many taxi drivers have said they wouldn't support strike action.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Advisory Committee will meet representatives from both the taxi industry and ride-hailing platforms on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that he's all for his ministers reaching out to the community and explaining their work, including to the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The head of the office, Xia Baolong, made a three-day visit to the Greater Bay Area earlier this month and met with some of the SAR's ministers, when Lee was in Harbin attending the Asian Winter Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said Xia is a busy leader, and that he and the top mainland official maintain good communication.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also support my ministers in doing their work in their own right... I support them in explaining issues to different people and reporting their work to the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, especially in explaining their specific portfolio to Director Xia personally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This precisely reflects my demands for different ministers to do their own part, taking charge of their responsibilities in resolving problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And at the same time, there's synergy among the team, united as one, complementing one another in handling problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said he wanted to once again thank Xia for pointing the way forward for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said Xia exchanged views with a number of SAR government officials on how Hong Kong will speed up reform and better integrate into the Greater Bay Area's development. During his trip, he visited the Hetao Innovation and Technology Cooperation Zone, as well as Qianhai and Yantian.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it strongly condemns unfounded malicious attacks online, after a court issued an order to confiscate the alleged crime proceeds of self-exiled national security suspect, Ted Hui.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of First Instance issued the confiscation order on Monday upon application by the Department of Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement overnight, a government spokesman accused Hui of committing numerous crimes, including conspiring with foreign politicians in 2020 to forge documents and deceive the court, in order to jump bail and abscond overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before and after Hui Chi-fung absconded from Hong Kong, he transferred nearly $2.5 million Hong Kong dollars in personal assets as gifts to his mother and wife," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government spokesman said such a gift made within six years from the date of prosecution may be regarded as the defendant's property, and confiscated under the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said it was common practice to confiscate crime proceeds, and denied that private property could be 'confiscated at any time' or 'arbitrarily', as such orders must comply with strict conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include that the court must be satisfied the absconded defendant could have been convicted of the offence and whether they benefited from the offence.

<img alt="Housing minister Winnie Ho, second left, says she expects the projects to receive an overwhelming response, especially the one in Kai Tak. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792012_1_20250217212430.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Bureau on Monday announced a new phase of light public flats, and people can begin moving in from the fourth quarter of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The second phase covers four projects in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun and Sheung Shui, generating 5,060 units with monthly rents between HK$860 and HK$3,270.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible people can submit their applications from February 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, housing minister Winnie Ho said she expects the projects to receive an overwhelming response, especially the one in Kai Tak adjacent to the MTR station
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing projects can effectively help residents in need. The locations of the second phase projects are very appealing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have about 5,000 units this time, and together with the 4,400 units announced in the first phase, we have introduced almost 10,000 flats. That is one-third of the total number."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who's the deputy chairman of the Legco housing panel, said while the projects would help reduce the waiting time for public housing, the focus should still be on building more public flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing is not for the long term. Some of the residents also have to move again after they [are allocated with] a public housing flat," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully, even though the waiting time will be shortened, we hope that the government can keep providing more public housing in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government aims to build a total of about 30,000 light public flats by 2028 under the scheme aimed at filling the short-term gap of public housing supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the projects announced in the first phase last year, Ho said people would start moving into the units in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok from March and June respectively.

 Hong Kong universities have seen a surge in non-local students, after the government doubled the enrolment ceiling for them to 40 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  So, how are these students adjusting to life here? And what efforts are being made to help them feel at home?
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to the warden and some students at St. John's College -- University of Hong Kong’s oldest residential hall -- to find out more.
