<img alt="CES 2025 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787411_1_20250114100720.jpg&q=45">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Everything from autonomous snow blowers to humanoid robots filled the show floors at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Considered the World Cup of technology, the world's largest personal electronics convention wrapped up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Making their tech presence felt at the four-day event were nearly 100 registered companies from Hong Kong, more than half supported by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP).
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this year, we bring 51 companies from Hong Kong... it's actually a huge growth compared to last year. Last year we have about 18," says Derek Chim, Head of Startup Ecosystem at HKSTP.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSTP-supported companies brought in three CES Innovation Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those, Vidi Labs, demonstrated how their wearable device - with AI-driven software - could describe the surrounding environment for a visually-impaired user.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This actually proves a lot that the route that we are on is actually the right one, because a product like this not only is for Hong Kong, it's actually for the rest of the world," said Turzo Bose, co-founder & CEO of Vidi Labs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the Hong Kong Pavilion, South Korean Minji Seo - who earned her PhD in Hong Kong - displays technology that rejuvenates your eyeballs with hot yoga therapy. It's intended to help people with dry eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We create a vacuum seal, using the silicone band around the goggle, and that's the chamber that we are controlling the temperature and pressure. Our main goal to join this event was to, like, verify whether we have a market here. And we definitely verified it," said Seo, founder of Ooley Care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong exhibitor, Michael Wong - a veteran of the Hong Kong hair care industry - uses a scanner to take images of your hair and scalp, and provide an analysis and recommendation for the right shampoo, conditioner and treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We use over millions of pictures to train our AI models so that's why it's accurate, over 90 percent. So everything just can do it within three minutes. So every American has their hair growth again, said Wong, founder and CEO of HairCoSys.
  <br>
  <br>
  His showmanship helps his startup, HairCoSys, stand out among the more than 4,500 exhibitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But so do products with unique compositions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fever Chu, co-founder of Zence Object Technology, displays everything from a TV remote that integrates recycled tea leaves, to a calculator frame composed of coffee grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are using their waste and turn it into new material and give back to them. Somehow we can help them to promote their waste product, the material, to the bigger market," said Chu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says their products have drawn plenty of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last night... over 60 [emails] within two days to the potential clients."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says he has already heard back from many of them, confirming his belief that companies around the world want a greener supply chain.

    'Thailand vows to help secure safe return of HKers'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Security chief Chris Tang on Monday said senior Thai officials have promised to do all they could to secure the safe return of Hongkongers who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The minister of justice gave great importance of our concern, and had responded positively. [Thai authorities] said they would do their utmost to help with the safe return of the Hong Kong people," said Tang, who stressed that none of those involved were abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang's comments came as a task force, led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, met Thai officials and representatives of the Chinese embassy in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  They spoke with representatives from Thailand's justice ministry who sit on the Anti Trafficking-in-Persons Committee chaired by the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said he is confident that Thai authorities would do their best to help those affected, noting that Hongkongers involved had been brought to areas near borders with Myanmar and Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He declined to disclose further details, saying that the SAR government wishes to rescue these residents as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force also held talks with Wu Zhiwu, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Thailand, on topics such as offering consular assistance, before meeting with staff at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the Thai capital to discuss further actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation is set to meet representatives of the Royal Thai Police on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the remaining 12 reported that there were restrictions on their movement but were safe and able to remain in touch with the task force.

    'Marriage a goal for many same-sex couples in HK'

<img alt="A CUHK survey suggests many members of sexual minorities in the city hope to get married one day. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787324_1_20250113172035.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey carried out by Chinese University researchers suggests many same-sex couples in Hong Kong would like to get married one day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government last year said it was working on an alternative legal framework, after the city's top court ordered authorities to look at how to recognise same-sex relationships by October.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK researchers on Monday said a survey involving 908 people who identify as members of sexual minorities in Hong Kong in 2023 found 90 percent believe same-sex marriage is important, and around 70 percent would like to get married themselves one day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, so for married heterosexual couples, they already have an existing framework. So if they can pass on kind of the same pattern of laws, which they can call civil partnership, they can call it marriage, but then make it comparable to non-heterosexual couples, then that would be great," said Alan, who joined the researchers' press conference along with his partner Hong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple, who wed in the US in 2022, said the lack of legal recognition of same-sex marriages in Hong Kong at the moment can pose challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, when my spouse gets sick, I would like to use my insurance package from work so that he can also be covered for medical visits. But I know in Hong Kong, not all insurance companies explicitly state that your spouse also includes same-sex couples," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also inheritance rights, that's also a significant hurdle for us," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, CUHK said another survey involving 146 people with non-heterosexual children found more than half of the parents were worried their sons and daughters would not get married due to their sexual orientation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy percent of the parents expressed fears that their children would have no one to take care of them when they are older.

    Four critically injured in scaffolding collapse

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eleven people on Monday were injured in a scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak, with four in critical condition and one seriously hurt.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel received reports of the incident on Shing Cheong Road at around 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bamboo structure, measuring 60 by 20 metres, was said to give way at the site where the New Acute Hospital is being built.
  <br>
  <br>
  One worker was temporarily trapped five metres above ground after the collapse, according to firefighters, who said the rescue operation took about an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the seriousness of the incident, police said they are working with government departments to conduct in-depth investigations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would see whether anyone should bear criminal responsibility... The cause of the scaffolding collapse is one of the directions of our investigation," said senior Inspector Li Ka-wai of the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project at the Kai Tak Development Area is set to be one of the largest hospitals in Hong Kong, with 2,400 beds, and 37 operating theatres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority (HA) expressed concerns over the incident and said the injured workers were hired by the contractor, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incident occurred at one of the buildings at the new acute hospital construction site, where curtain wall installation works were undergone," the authority said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All scaffolding work at the site will be temporarily suspended, and the HA reserves the right to hold the construction contractor accountable."
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority has instructed the contractor to implement all necessary safety measures as soon as possible and requested it to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and to submit a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fay Siu from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims noted that a similar incident happened in Kai Tak almost a year ago, saying it showed that there are safety hazards when bamboo scaffolding is used.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government should review the safety of bamboo scaffolding, because they are not made from a very stable material," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we are continuing to use bamboo scaffolding, there should be better inspections. The use of metal scaffolding should be encouraged too."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union has also strongly urged labour authorities to conduct an in-depth probe and make its report public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Labour Department must seriously learn from the hard lessons of past industrial accidents, quickly review regulatory and enforcement loopholes, swiftly address deficiencies, and effectively strengthen supervision and inspection work," it said.

    'Reducing sodium will not affect dim sum taste'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department urged dim sum restaurants to reduce sodium content in their dishes after its survey revealed that a small decrease in salt would not affect its taste.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department conducted a test among 72 people to evaluate standard and reduced-sodium samples of two types of classic dim sum dishes, including shrimp siu mai and steamed pork ribs in black bean sauce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results showed that only 15 people were able to identify the altered shrimp siu mai, while only 13 spotted the modified steamed pork ribs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tony Chow, principal medical officer of risk assessment and communication at the Centre for Food Safety, said restaurants could consider choosing ingredients with lower sodium content or using natural ingredients for flavouring and marinating.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We advise the [dim sum] trade to consider the reformulation of the dim sum so that the sodium content can be reduced because our study indicates that for the 10 to 20 percent reduction in sodium, the consumer will not differentiate the difference in the sodium content," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should not worry [that] the less salty food will be rejected by the consumer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow also said people should request that their dim sum be served separately from sauces when possible, and to taste before including additional flavouring.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also recommended that people share dim sum dishes when possible to avoid indulging, adding that the elderly should be more mindful of sodium levels when choosing their dishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said the World Health Organisation recommends less than five grammes of salt intake daily, as excessive sodium intake could increase the risk of high blood pressure, and other diseases.

 The mixer from a cement truck fell onto the road in Yau Ma Tei, although no injuries were reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the incident happened at about 3pm on Monday on Waterloo Road near Ferry Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  From a photo taken at the scene, the loading compartment was detached from the truck and lay across the road while the vehicle was stationary.

    HK can help companies diversify risk: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Monday that Hong Kong can offer professional services to companies seeking to diversify risk by moving their businesses to different places.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the annual Asian Financial Forum, the minister noted that many firms are realigning or restructuring their industrial and supply chains across different countries, particularly in the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong, as a supply chain management centre, has things to offer companies seeking diversification.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [firms] would require project finance, corporate treasury and logistics services, professional consultancies and extensive international connections," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is well positioned and geared up to provide all these services as a one-stop shop to help businesses expand their presence in the region and beyond effectively."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR will navigate the global geopolitical and economic landscape with caution and confidence, saying opportunities come with every challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong can also offer technological solutions and sustainable development for the region, with its plans to develop an innovation and technology cooperation zone with Shenzhen in the Hetao area, also known as the Lok Ma Chau Loop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR is looking to expand in areas such as artificial intelligence, biotech and new energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Loop, he said, is an example of Hong Kong forming synergy with sister cities in the Greater Bay area for IT development, such as speeding up the development of medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The zone] will be a base to pioneer with innovative policies and collaborations, such as joint clinical trials that leverage on data and bio-samples from both the mainland and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed that these areas of development come on top of the SAR's traditional positioning as an international financial centre.

 Tourism officials on Monday called on industry leaders to find ways to attract more overnight visitors to Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year "golden week" holiday on the mainland, as they expect a significant rise in tourist numbers over the eight-day period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, noted the upcoming holiday is a peak travel season and the SAR would be holding a series of festive activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect there to be a significant increase in tourists visiting Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year golden week," Law said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage the industry to seize this opportunity and be flexible to provide visitors with more high-quality and innovative experiences, attract them to stay overnight in Hong Kong to fully experience Hong Kong's unique festive atmosphere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who chaired a meeting with various government departments and representatives of the tourism and hotel sectors, also said relevant authorities would continue to maintain close communication and make preparations on welcoming visitors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, has welcomed news that the People's Bank of China will unveil various measures to boost financial collaboration between the SAR and the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng made the announcement during a speech on the first day of the Asian Financial Forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include the linking of Hong Kong's Fast Payment System (FPS) to the mainland's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS).
  <br>
  <br>
  “Residents in the two places can make real-time cross-boundary payments using their phone number,” Yue told reporters after attending the forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect to launch part of the service in the middle of the year, and will expand the scheme slowly and in an orderly manner, based on our actual implementation situation and experience.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other measures include the launch of a trade finance scheme to help enterprises trading in yuan improve liquidity.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be 100 billion yuan available in currency swaps for one, three and six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue said the scheme will be rolled out by February.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday, the clearing time for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect will be pushed back by one hour to 4.30pm, while mainland investors will also be allowed to buy securities of more currency types, including the US dollar and the euro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui, for his part, said the various measures show the central bank’s support in consolidating Hong Kong’s role as a financial centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Pan Gongsheng on Monday said Beijing will significantly increase the proportion of its national foreign exchange reserves and asset allocation in Hong Kong, as part of efforts to boost the development of the city's financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the 18th annual Asian Financial Forum in the SAR, Pan also said authorities will continue to deepen the financial market connectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland, to attract foreign capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prosperous capital markets are the cornerstone of Hong Kong as an international financial centre...We'll support more quality enterprises to list and issue bonds in the SAR, and continue to improve connectivity between the mainland and Hong Kong in areas like stocks, bonds, wealth management and interest rate swaps, to deepen financial cooperation within the Greater Bay Area," he told forum participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will significantly increase the proportion of our foreign exchange reserves and our asset allocation in Hong Kong to open up a broader space for Hong Kong's financial development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan said the PBOC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will introduce relevant policies to improve Hong Kong's offshore renminbi markets, while providing more convenience regarding cross-border payment and settlements.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the measures is the launch of an additional renminbi trade financing liquidity fund, with terms of one month, three months and six months, totalling 100 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), said the central government will continue to support the SAR in consolidating its status as a global financial hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, the central government will, as always, do its utmost to support the consolidation of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, trade centre and shipping centre, and will support the SAR in accelerating the pace of developing scientific and technological innovation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On another note, Zhou said Beijing will continue to create new advantages by developing new quality productive forces to help with regional growth, stressing that the Chinese economy remains resilient with stable fundamentals.

    'High hopes for the SAR's task force in Thailand'

<img alt="Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was confident the SAR task force in Thailand would deliver results. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787266_1_20250113115736.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was optimistic about the prospects of the SAR's task force in Thailand, which is investigating allegations that Hongkongers have been lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal types of work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force, led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk, with members from Security Bureau and the Immigration Department, flew to Thailand on Sunday, after receiving 28 requests for assistance connected to Hong Kong residents who were allegedly held in the region against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, 16 people have managed to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven men and five women reported restrictions on their movement, but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force. It is thought they were not forcibly abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK programme on Monday, Lai said the SAR government was highly concerned which is why it sent the task force led by Cheuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had high hopes for the task force's prospects given it has been liaising with Thai authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also believed the Thai police would also pay high attention to such incidents, considering the potential impact on tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Thai police also attach importance to this issue because it seriously affects the country's tourist industry. There have been media reports that many mainland tourists have cancelled trips to Thailand over the upcoming Lunar New Year - so I think Thailand wants to handle any incidents well,” Lai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai said many were lured to Southeast Asia on bogus job offers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on authorities to raise public awareness about the dangers of getting lured by such schemes.

    Pollster under probe over 'assisting absconder'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang has confirmed that national security police are investigating whether pollster Robert Chung or his research organisation had provided assistance to an absconder.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources earlier said Chung was taken away from his home on Monday morning, and brought to the Wong Chuk office of the Public Opinion Research Institute, of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chung was being invited back to the police station for investigations on suspected assistance to an absconder. At this moment in time, Chung has not been arrested," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has nothing to do with any research being done by Chung or his organisation. Our whole investigation is focusing on how Chung and his organisation [allegedly assisted] the absconder. It's absolutely nothing to do with the result of their poll."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the probe is related to the pollster's former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Chung Kim-wah was last month put on a police wanted list for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is suspected of inciting secession on social media and colluding with foreign forces, and police are offering a HK$1 million reward for information leading to his arrest.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told thousands of business leaders from around the world that Hong Kong is working towards developing itself into an international gold trading centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his opening remarks at the Asian Financial Forum on Monday, Lee revealed that the SAR will build world-class gold storage facilities, and strengthen support services in insurance, testing and certification, as well as logistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ultimately, we plan to create a holistic gold trading centre with an industry chain," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stability in Hong Kong amidst rapid changes in geopolitics around the world will provide a world of investors a secure environment for gold storage as well as other forms of wealth management."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the SAR will build on its existing advantages, and expand its overseas network, particularly with Belt and Road countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strategies include strengthening financial cooperation with the Middle East and the 10-member states of ASEAN, as well as other established and emerging markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will also organise more international financial events, seek collaboration in financial products, talent and experience sharing, and attract more overseas enterprises and capital to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18th edition of the two-day Asian Financial Forum - themed "Powering the Next Growth Engine" - has attracted some 3,600 business and financial leaders from more than 50 countries and regions this year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health said on Sunday that around 1,700 staff members have been deployed to two test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park - but it stressed that this had "not in any way" affected the treatment of patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  The clarification came after multiple media reports suggested some patients had to reschedule their bookings because medical staff were drafted in to take part in upcoming drills to gauge the park's crowd management measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the department confirmed that staff will be sent to drills on January 24 and February 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said minor adjustments were made to the appointment dates for non-therapeutic student health services with the consent of service recipients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All have been agreed by the members of the public concerned and only two appointments will be postponed by one working day, while the others will be brought forward by two to 10 working days," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department stressed that the Student Health Service provides regular health assessment and health education of a preventive nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  That said, it pledged to make more careful planning and strengthen internal co-ordination when deploying staff for future drills, so as to minimise disruption to public services.

    Industry to bear cost of cigarette tax labels: Customs

<img alt="Customs chief Chan Tsz-tat says the labelling system is aimed at targeting untaxed cigarettes attempting to pass off as legal, duty-paid ones. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787178_1_20250112155320.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs say tobacco firms will likely have to bear the cost of an upcoming labelling system which will help consumers differentiate duty-paid cigarettes from illicit ones.
 <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner of Customs and Excise Chan Tsz-tat explained the proposed scheme is aimed at weeding out untaxed cigarettes which boast identical or similar packaging to their duty-paid counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both feature government health warnings, and can be difficult to distinguish even by retailers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said one way to implement the scheme is to introduce anti-forgery features on the packaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labels will be similar to anti-forgery features on banknotes, which are hard to replicate," Chan told a television programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be a digital tag to be scanned. The tag can be attached when the cigarettes are produced but duty has not been paid. When duty is paid, we can activate the label from the back end. Then we will know the batch has been taxed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan dismissed concerns that tobacco companies will transfer the extra costs to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our initial thought is to have the tobacco industry shoulder the cost. Currently, a pack of cigarettes on the market is sold for over HK$100. The cost of adding labels is minimal and will have no impact on the selling price," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also looking to introduce stiffer penalties for people who flout a law on the permitted amount of cigarettes they can bring into Hong Kong tax-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, each traveller can carry 19 sticks of cigarettes every time they enter the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officials are looking to amend legislation within this year, so offenders will be fined HK$5,000, up from HK$2,000.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial secretary said an annual financial forum this week includes a new discussion panel on how to cooperate with Gulf countries, as Hong Kong looks to grasp development opportunities with the Global South.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said the Asian Financial Forum - set to begin on Monday - will host some 3,600 policymakers and business leaders from more than 50 countries and regions, a scale similar to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The forum sets up a new chapter on the Gulf Cooperation Council, making new explorations on how to deepen financial cooperation between Hong Kong and the Middle East, while encouraging more bilateral capital flows," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged Hong Kong businesses to grasp the new development opportunities brought by the emerging markets. These include the Middle East, as well as nations from Asean and the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also noted that the SAR serve as a platform for countries like Indonesia to raise funds for products such as catastrophe bonds, or infrastructure and green projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, he led a 130-strong delegation to Jakarta to conduct business exchange and lure investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said given the risks of disasters brought by climate change, companies can opt for Hong Kong's catastrophe bond products, raise funds through issuing bonds in different currencies, or establish trusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that Indonesian representatives also expressed keen interest in Hong Kong's innovation and technology sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten startups from the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park took part in dozens of business matching sessions, potentially reeling in over US$5 million of business, Chan revealed.

<img alt="The Security Bureau is leading a dedicated task force, with members from Police and the Immigration Department to Thailand to investigate reports of Hong Kong residents being forced to work.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A six-member task force led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk has set off for Thailand on Sunday to investigate reports of Hong Kong residents allegedly lured to Southeast Asian countries and detained to engage in illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force comprises officials from the Security Bureau, as well as police and the Immigration Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Cheuk said the Thai government is very concerned about the issue and is willing to arrange a meeting with SAR officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, we have been communicating with the relevant authorities. In terms of the latest development, we hope to meet them face-to-face and understand the situation and to seek all feasible help from them and see how we collaborate," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for the operation goal, we for sure want all Hongkongers to come back safely. This is our ultimate goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted criminals are adopting new methods to lure victims to Southeast Asian countries. These include asking people to help bring packages to Japan or Taiwan, but then changing the destination to a Southeast Asian country at the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force will also meet officials from the Chinese embassy in Bangkok, and talk to Ministry of Justice representatives on an anti-human trafficking committee chaired by the Thai prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen have already returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said the remaining 12 are aged 21 to 43, and none were abducted. They reported restrictions on their movement but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to media enquiries, the Security Bureau revealed on Saturday that it had recently received an assistance request from the family of an SAR resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman, in her twenties, was reportedly detained in a Southeast Asian country.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the case had since been taken up by the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, and the local Chinese Embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The relevant parities provided advice and all feasible help based on the family’s wishes, and it is understood the woman has returned to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau called on the public to be vigilant against online job advertisements which are too good to be true - either those which claim to offer quick money, or highly-paid positions which do not require any work experience or academic qualification.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A hill fire which had been burning in Pat Heung since Saturday afternoon was largely put out after more than 20 hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Fire Services Department said Sunday that the Government Flying Service is also water bombing the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze near Kai Kung Leng, literally meaning Rooster Ridge, once stretched to 200 metres from one end to the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency services first received reports about the fire at around 5.30pm on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Government Flying Service helicopter was deployed later that evening to extract two hikers trapped inside Lam Tsuen Country Park due to the fire and strong winds. They were both evacuated safely.

    2025 full of uncertainties and challenges: HKMA chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has predicted that 2025 will be a year marked by uncertainties and many changes, while the SAR will be affected by policies set to be introduced by incoming US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authority chief executive Eddie Yue also admitted on Sunday the city cannot fully shield itself from unforeseen factors in global financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we look at the global monetary policy from a couple years ago, we experienced similar external shocks - our interest rates went up and down together," he told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But now there's division in international monetary policy. The United States may have slower rate cuts, but other places will increase interest rates. It could lead to faster and more volatile global capital flows, with cracks emerging that we didn't see over the past few years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking back at the past year, Yue said Hong Kong's overall financial system had developed "quite well". The Hong Kong dollar remained stable, while the linked exchange rate system operated in an orderly manner, he noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's de-facto central banker also said global investors had changed their impression of the SAR over the past year, referring to his observations at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether they were being interviewed on stage or chatting with us on the side, they had full confidence in Hong Kong and saw that we have many opportunities in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one asked me how the Article 23 [legislation] affected Hong Kong or how the national security law affected Hong Kong. Those were no longer topics of interest. [Investors] were more concerned about the development of the mainland."

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 200,000 people visited an exhibition in Dubai showcasing the appeal and vibrancy of Hong Kong through interactive art technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Immersive Hong Kong" exhibition was part of Hong Kong's broader initiative to strengthen ties with the Middle East, with Chief Executive John Lee and other senior officials leading delegations to the region since 2023, to tell good stories of the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, held from December 20 last year to January 5, was organised by the Information Services Department and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apollonia Liu, the Director of Information Services, said the city has been fostering closer ties with the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very delighted with the positive response as well as the expansion of our circle of friends and network through staging this exhibition," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Information Services Department said it will explore organising the exhibition in other cities later this year, after already holding it in Dubai, Jakarta, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Guangzhou.

 <br>

  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong experienced its coldest day so far this winter, with the observatory recording a minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees at its Tsim Sha Tsui headquarters on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mercury dipped even lower in parts of the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the forecaster warned of possible frost on Saturday morning, on high ground or in the northern part of the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, hikers in Tai Mo Shan told RTHK that they hadn't seen any frost overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It would create a really memorable experience. We'll take some photos if we see it. There's a small chance it could happen, but I won't be disappointed if we don't see it," said a hiker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory reminded the public to wrap up warm and maintain proper indoor ventilation, adding that chilly weather is expected on Sunday morning.

    'Customs officers must hold themselves accountable'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs chief Chan Tsz-tat stressed that safety takes priority for officers and they must hold themselves accountable for their actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  A 27-year-old motorcyclist was killed last week in Kowloon Bay, after his vehicle rammed into an iron pole, and a 40-year-old man was later arrested on suspicion of tampering with a motor vehicle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs earlier said it was a tragic incident, and confirmed that one of their officers was involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Chan said the case has been undergoing investigation and the involved frontline officer is now on leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed that officers should contribute to society within legal and safe circumstances, and be responsible for every action even if they are not on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have all along provided very comprehensive training for our staff members, starting from joining our department to on-the-job training, we have set very clear instructions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the case, I must reiterate that safety is our primary consideration, no matter if a staff member is carrying out his duty in his official capacity or as a private citizen."

    Naming schools refusing flu jab sensible: Lo

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Saturday said the government must inform parents about which schools are not offering on-site flu shots so they can plan to get their children vaccinated elsewhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comment came a day after the Department of Health named 168 schools that refused to take part in a voluntary on-campus vaccination programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme, Lo said the transparency isn't about damaging school reputations but about protecting children's health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the parents are not aware that their school does not offer the program, they will not be aware that they would need to bring their kids to a private clinic or whatever facility and arrange the vaccination for their own kids," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have the responsibility to inform the public and especially the parents. So it's not a matter of affecting the reputation of a certain school. I think this is a fact and we all have the same mission and that is to protect our kids especially in this winter flu season."
  <br>
  <br>
  The health chief also said that the winter influenza season has officially begun, with a four-year-old boy who didn't get a flu shot and whose school didn't offer vaccines, now in intensive care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lo said elderly patients no longer need to wait in long queues outside dental clinics in cold weather with the new online appointment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that at the age of 80, our elderly will still be able to retain their [teeth], at least have more than 20 teeth. That would save a lot of our resources in providing treatment for them," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday called on businesses to contribute to the country's development by investing on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum in Shenzhen on technological collaboration between the two places, the CE noted that firms can benefit from Beijing's new amendments to the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, or CEPA, which will take effect in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes include applying Hong Kong laws when firms from the SAR engage in arbitration, and allowing the proceedings to take place in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I encourage Hong Kong firms, or even companies from around the world, to make use of CEPA's new preferential treatments, and explore countless opportunities in the mainland market," Lee said in a speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can then serve the country by bringing in capital and talent, while companies can go global."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said Hong Kong and Shenzhen can become a driving force in the development of new quality productive forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR's businesses should also further develop their regional and international networks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that as the latest round of technological revolution takes place rapidly, firms should adapt to changes and seize opportunities provided by the nation's opening up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, innovation, technology and industry minister Sun Dong noted that the SAR needs to align itself with the country's development plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the need to speed up the construction of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone to provide impetus for high-level development in the region.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they arrested 17 people for allegedly conspiring to verbally intimidate the candidates and scrutineers in an election to pick the representatives of a public housing estate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The votes, which took place last month, was to select residents to oversee the management of King Lam Estate in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Chief Inspector Ho Kai-ho said officers made the arrests between December 18 and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added the suspects were aged between 25 and 77 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of them have backgrounds related to triads, but it is not appropriate to disclose the exact number of suspects with triad backgrounds here. Among those arrested in this operation, some were candidates in this election," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also said if convicted of conspiracy to criminally intimidate, offenders could face up to a five-year jail term.

    Patient transferred to HK using cross-border ambulance

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 67-year-old patient was transferred from the Greater Bay Area (GBA) to Tuen Mun Hospital on Friday, the first case arranged under a cross-boundary ambulance transfer scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-year pilot scheme for direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer was launched in November last year, allowing patients in the GBA to be conveyed to designated hospitals in the SAR directly without the need to be handed over to local health authorities at boundary control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority said its major incident control centre received a request for a patient transfer from the Shenzhen Hospital of the University of Hong Kong on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the patient was admitted to the hospital in the GBA on Tuesday due to respiratory failure and had to be put on a ventilator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anne Lee, deputy hospital chief executive of the Shenzhen Hospital, said the patient's condition improved and his family hoped he could be treated in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the patient is still in a serious condition, we think he is stable enough for a safe transfer," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the man was transferred from the GBA hospital at 11am via the Shenzhen Bay Port, and arrived at Tuen Mun Hospital in about 40 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the process was smooth and the patient had been admitted to a ward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the criteria for patients to be transferred to Hong Kong, she said authorities are always willing to help patients in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only patients using a ventilator are suitable for a transfer. If patients were involved in a traffic accident on the mainland, and have suffered fractures, they would not be able to use public transport to cross the border," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lee stressed that if patients were able to make use of public transportation or could make arrangements themselves, they should not use this cross-boundary ambulance service.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University (PolyU) on Friday said that artificial intelligence, cancer treatment and innovative construction technologies were among 18 research projects it had received public funding for in the current financial year.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said in a statement it received nearly HK$92 million from the Research Grants Council, an advisory body under the University Grants Committee that allocates funding to eight local universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university said money for three of the projects came from a grant that supports younger academic staff with their research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four others are to do with the Research Impact Fund, and they cover studies on sustainable aviation fuel engineering, cancer immunotherapy, modular integrated 3D-printed concrete construction, and headsets design for virtual reality and augmented reality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The successes in securing [the council's] funds further illustrate PolyU’s strength in basic research and its capacity to lead innovative projects with significant societal impact, delivering valuable benefits," said the university's vice president for research and innovation, Christopher Chao.

 The Observatory (HKO) on Friday said a 4.2 magnitude earthquake stuck the sea south of Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said more than 10 people in Hong Kong reported feeling minor shaking sensations for a few seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKO said the quake hit the waters south of Shanwei city at 2.40pm, with the epicentre around 200 kilometres south-east of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tremor's focal depth was about 10 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Initial estimate gave a local intensity of III (three) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, that is felt indoors. The vibration was like passing of light trucks," the HKO said.

    Officials take jab at schools refusing vaccine drive

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities have singled out more than 160 schools for declining to arrange on-campus influenza vaccinations, calling on parents to bring their children to get jabbed as soon as possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  The list of schools, which has been uploaded online, includes a number of international and elite institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albert Au, head of the Centre for Health Protection's communicable disease branch, on Friday said seven institutional or school outbreaks were reported last week, up from two to four cases a week in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities have reminded schools to take extra precautionary measures and that most of them have arranged on-campus vaccinations for pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A tiny fraction of schools have still refused to arrange on-campus vaccinations through the outreach programme for pupils. There are 168 of them. Another 13 schools which had previously agreed to arrange vaccinations, have not yet confirmed a date for the jabs," Au told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to urge the parents of pupils studying at these schools, to bring their children to get vaccinated as soon as possible, if they haven't already done so."
  <br>
  <br>
  Au added the city had entered the flu season with influenza activity expected to increase further before peaking in about a month's time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Ip, professor in paediatrics and adolescent medicine at the University of Hong Kong, urged schools to help all pupils get vaccinated against the flu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[For] all those schools that have not joined the school vaccination programme, I would encourage them to seriously think about what would be a better arrangement, for example, through better communication with the parents, particularly those parents of the younger kids," Ip told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the vaccination rate among young kids, particularly those in pre-school and kindergarten, was rather unsatisfactory.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of the NGOs, which operates under the Green@Community network, on Friday called on the government to offer more subsidies, as the community recycling network is due to take charge of all plastic collection work at the city's housing estates.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the existing pilot scheme, three contractors were responsible for plastic collection at Eastern, Kwun Tong and Sha Tin districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, organisations under the Green@Community network at three districts - Eastern, Kwun Tong and Sha Tin - were also tasked with heading to housing estates to collect recyclables other than plastics.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the scheme coming to an end, the Environmental Protection Department announced that a new arrangement would be implemented on January 19 to consolidate the process and prevent a duplication of resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau Wing-kwong, founder of the organisation that operates under the Green@Community network in Tai Po Market, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that there will be increased costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Previously, the collection is by the pilot scheme. So they (the government) did not put the budget on delivery of the plastic or treatment of the plastic because the contractor would come and take it away," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the change of the pilot scheme, they have to pay more for the collectors to come and take it. They're talking about one part of cost for delivery - they come to collect the plastic - and another cost for treating the plastic. So all these additional costs would be put on the recyclable shops, the collection shops."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yau assured the public that Green@Community's service quality would not be compromised under the new arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We really don't have to worry about that. Because the Environmental Protection Department comes to visit us very frequently, and they have offices working very closely with all these recyclable shops," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, it's well-documented every day how much waste is collected, where it goes, and who has taken the recyclables away to recycle. It's all well-documented, and we make sure that they go to the right channel."

    'Govt to release report on care teams after deal ends'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Alice Mak, on Friday said the government would publish a comprehensive report of care teams once the service agreement with them ends.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government outsources district-level community services to care teams, which offer assistance to residents in each district, such as visiting the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teams are required to submit work and financial reports regularly to the authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Chinese University's student publication, U-Beat, earlier reported that it was unable to access these reports while doing a story on the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Mak said it is more appropriate to reveal this information after the two-year contract concludes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the two-year service agreement, we will disclose the achievements of the care teams, including their work targets and indicators attained, in an appropriate manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that after the two-year service agreement, there will be a complete and comprehensive record. I also think this approach is appropriate," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are 452 care teams in Hong Kong, with the first batch beginning their services in the Southern District in April 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home affairs chief noted the teams were able to visit 340,000 households over the past year, describing their performance as ideal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The new commissioner of customs and excise, Chan Tsz-tat, said officers are dedicated to enhancing measures to tackle space oil drug cases, both those produced locally and those smuggled in from abroad, in order to curb the rise of this emerging narcotic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan said customs seized around 23.5 kilogrammes of etomidate, a main component of the space oil drug, last year, primarily shipped to Hong Kong via express delivery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Friday, Chan said the department conducted a raid on a local drug distributor just a few days ago, highlighting the alarming popularity of the drug in the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we found that person was in possession of one kilogramme of cocaine, we subsequently escorted the offender to his premises. What was so surprising is that we also found at that place that the drug trafficker is in fact manufacturing at his home space oil drugs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is in possession of apparatus to make these material of space oil drug into those capsules that can be easily consumed using electronic smoking devices."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said frontline officers are equipped with specialised equipment in detecting the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been using ion scanners as well as Raman spectrometres. These two types of equipment are very effective in detecting whether any consignment contain such drugs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On top of our detection on the front line, we also use a risk-based and intelligence-led approach to suppress the smuggling of dangerous drugs."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said they would utilise big data to analyse the sources of shipments, transporters and declaration information moving forward.

    'Cathay meals unlikely the cause for food poisoning'

<img alt="Cathay Pacific says it will continue to work closely with the relevant authorities and provide support to the affected passengers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786854_1_20250109221828.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Thursday said it was unlikely that meals provided by the carrier had caused food poisoning among passengers travelling on its Nepal-to-Hong Kong route.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 25 passengers who took two separate Cathay flights from Kathmandu to the SAR earlier in the week had fallen ill, reporting symptoms like vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and fever.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection noted that it has conducted a preliminary investigation on the first flight that arrived on Tuesday, saying the chicken sandwiches that many of the sick passengers ate before the journey might be to blame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifteen other passengers on the same route that arrived in the SAR early Thursday also reported similar symptoms, but it’s so far uncertain whether they too consumed chicken sandwiches before their flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a precautionary measure, the CHP said it has collected samples from Cathay’s in-flight meals for testing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier, for its part, said it takes food safety and hygiene very seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this stage, it appears that the likely source of any food contamination was outside the airline's operation. However, should this not be the case we will report the incident transparently and will take all necessary corrective actions," a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay stressed it has reminded its crew members to observe general food safety guidelines and maintain good personal hygiene, and is advising passengers to do the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to work closely with the relevant authorities throughout the investigation and provide necessary support to the affected passengers," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The safety and well-being of our staff and passengers guide every decision we make. We sincerely apologise to the affected passengers for any inconvenience caused."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department on Thursday announced changes to Hong Kong’s plastic waste collection system as a pilot scheme ends soon.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the pilot scheme rolled out in 2020, three contractors collected plastic from locations in Eastern, Kwun Tong and Sha Tin districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said there was an overlap of resources as Green@Community operators gathered other types of recyclables from these same places.
  <br>
  <br>
  From January 19, Green@Community will consolidate and streamline this process across all 18 districts by taking charge of plastic waste collection in addition to other recyclables.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Wong, an assistant director with the department, said the new arrangement will reduce costs by 24 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We consider this is a situation of resource duplication and it is an opportunity to unify the arrangement to enhance the [scheme's] cost effectiveness," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The completion of the pilot scheme and taking over by Green@Community station for the collection service will not only solve the resource duplication problem, but enhance the cost-effectiveness of the overall waste and recyclable collection services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also brushed aside concerns from green groups that some low-value mixed plastic waste will be left unprocessed after the pilot scheme ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that every plastic has its value. They can be turned into useful resources. Not only bottles, for example, plastic containers, they could be transformed into high-value eco-bricks or soundproofing facilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regardless of the pilot scheme, or the future Green@Community operation, every waste plastic is sought after and we will continue to enhance the plastic recycling rate."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that residents will not be affected and can continue to use recycling bins at housing estates or Green@Commuity stations as before.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior leadership at the West Kowloon arts hub on Thursday said they would retain some managing rights of its housing development when it is completed, vowing to incorporate arts and cultural elements into the residential project.
 <br>
  <br>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority had proposed a residential project to build nearly 2,000 homes, which would sit on top of a three-storey podium for retail, food and beverages, and leisure facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions were raised during a Yau Tsim Mong District Council meeting on whether the housing development would weaken the district's cultural position, with the authority's deputy chief executive Wendy Gan saying it would oversee commercial facilities in the project.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The residential flats of this project will be sold to the public by the developer with a successful tender bid,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But for the shopping mall, the plan right now is to be managed by the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority. With this, we could have a certain level of influence, while continuing to hold arts and culture events in the entire district.”
  <br>
  <br>
  On concerns about the proposed housing project affecting the price of property nearby, Gan said people should take into account the fact that the precinct has become a world-class cultural landmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let’s say for a residence in Paris next to the Louvre, there's a discrepancy in value compared to a home [which is] not next to the Louvre... I hope we are comprehensive in considering something's value," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also "too early” to give an estimate on the revenue generated from the proposed development with the residential project likely being put up for tender in more than a year's time, Gan added.

    Security and development both key: Xia Baolong

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing’s top official on Hong Kong affairs on Thursday stressed that safeguarding national security goes hand in hand with development as he laid out Beijing’s expectations for Hong Kong and Macau to make pragmatic contributions to the overall development of the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong was speaking in at a seminar in Beijing on the spirit of a key speech by President Xi Jinping in Macau last month to mark 25 years since its return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia said both SARs need to be unwavering both in maintaining security and in focusing on development, and that Hong Kong and Macau need to fully demonstrate the benefits of the One country, two systems principle as they connect the country with the world, and “polish” their brands internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director noted that the President had spoken about how the values of peace, inclusiveness and openness are all embodied in One country, two systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted President Xi’s directive for the SARs to adopt the necessary changes to make greater contributions to the Greater Bay Area, adding that the president's expectations and hopes for Macau also apply to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also stressed the need for unity under the banner of patriotism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In implementing the One Country, Two Systems principle, not only do [the two SARs] need to promote the core value of patriotism and loving Hong Kong and Macau, they also need to seek common ground and allow for differences," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a response, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR government would better integrate with the nation with a highly efficient market, and be steadfast in leading and promoting socio-economic development here.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a social media post, he added that his administration would maintain peace, stability and unity within society, while acting as a bridge between the nation and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE was among many who watched in the seminar via video-link in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event was organised by the think tank Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its vice president, Tam Yiu-chung, added that Xia had expressed hopes that the business sector would continue to be proactive in taking part in the development of both the country and the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He thinks businesses have always been very supportive in the country's development. A high ratio of investments on the mainland came from Hong Kong companies," Tam said in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So Director Xia expressed hope that going forward, Hong Kong's business sector continues to be proactive."
  <br>
  <br>
  A consultant for the think tank, Lau Siu-kai, quoted Xia as saying that Hong Kong needs to change its mindset and be more innovative on economic development.

    More tax concessions needed despite budget deficit: EY

<img alt="Paul Ho (left) says the estimated budget deficit would be around HK$98 billion for this financial year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786813_1_20250109165740.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Consulting firm EY on Thursday called on the government to roll out more tax concessions, although it expected the budget deficit would double.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm estimated that Hong Kong’s budget deficit would be HK$98 billion, while accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) forecast the gap at HK$95 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, government officials said the deficit would be near HK$100 billion, more than double the original estimate of HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  EY noted that governemnt revenue from land premiums and stamp duty fell short of expectations, despite the easing of property cooling measures last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the consultancy's financial services tax leader for Hong Kong, Paul Ho, said authorities should cut tax for real estate investors and commodity traders to boost the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Providing those concessions will actually attract more businesses and investors and capital to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tax concessions or some kind of tax measures that could benefit and attract investors will actually overall help the growth of the Hong Kong economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  PwC also called for similar moves, suggesting the government reduce tax for research and development activities in the Greater Bay Area.

    Govt can reduce fiscal deficit through bonds: HKU

<img alt="The HKU Business School has released its latest green paper on Hong Kong's economic policy. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786814_1_20250109165822.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A scholar from the University of Hong Kong's business school suggested the government issue bonds and spend its fiscal reserves, to reduce the nearly HK$100 billion deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Associate professor Liu Yang, along with other professors from the business school, released the “Hong Kong Economic Policy Green Paper 2025” on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu felt the SAR cannot rely on a natural economic recovery to resolve its fiscal challenges, adding the government should fully utilise its fiscal reserves.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Fiscal deficit can be short-term and the debt can absorb it. So we don't have to right away next year get a fiscal surplus. Fiscal deficit can last and there's not a problem to have a few years of a fiscal deficit as long as we have a good average condition for the long term,” Liu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to the government, they're going to try to solve the problem and get back to surplus by 2027, which I think is a very good agenda. And apart from that, I think the easiest way of paying the deficit is actually to run down the reserves. So you don't have to issue debt, but as long as you have reserves, you pay out directly and that's going to cover the deficit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu also said the government can raise funds by issuing bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there is room for the SAR government to raise its debt-to-GDP ratio from currently around 10 percent, to 20 or 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Reserve and debt, they are just two sides of the same coin. Suppose nothing happened and we issue lots of debt and we keep the money in our account, then that becomes our reserve. So you can let the reserve down and not issue in debt. That's one way to just basically to pay your deficit. You can also keep your reserve and issue some debt to directly pay your deficit. The actual question is how much reserve we want to have, how much is enough and how much debt we are comfortable with,” Liu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The green paper also stressed the importance for Hong Kong to undergo an economic transformation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Associate dean Tang Heiwai said Hong Kong should find a new strategic role and strive to become a global supply chain management centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR should not only act as a bridge to the West, it should also become a gateway between China and other emerging economies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A joint research report published by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and United Overseas Bank found that the SAR has been successful in carving out a role as a super-connector between the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and countries within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
 <br>
  <br>
  The study surveyed more than 600 GBA based companies over the last three months of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irina Fan, the HKTDC's Director of Research, talked about how the trade development council could help Hong Kong deepen this role as a super-connector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From here [the fairs held by HKTDC] all the executors, they are from the Greater Bay Area mostly, and then even from international market, be able to meet up and make the business deals with the target market in Asean and other markets in the region."
  <br>
  <br>
  The data also showed that more than 90 percent of manufacturing businesses in the GBA had either completed their supply chain transformation or were in the process of doing so, with a majority focused on boosting their supply chain resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan explained that Covid and natural disasters had exposed the fragility of supply chains when one country's production had stopped, showing the need for parallel or alternative supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, to achieve sustainability, supply chains are being shortened and built around major markets that specifically serve regional markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan also said that geopolitical reasons are one of the factors affecting the stability of such supply chains, adding it would likely continue to affect how investors choose where to invest in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Good relations between China and Asean was helping Hong Kong businesses tap into the Asean market.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the survey, of the individual Asean markets, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia were the preferred choices for current and future business activities.

    URA gets warning letter for data leak

<img alt="The Privacy Commissioner issued the Urban Renewal Authority a warning letter for a data breach last May. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786773_1_20250109130529.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The privacy watchdog on Thursday said it had given the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) a warning letter for breaching data protection laws in May last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes after the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) completed its investigation into the incident and released its findings in a report on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the PCPD, the phone numbers, names and addresses of nearly 200 people, affected by the redevelopment plan for Nga Tsin Wai and Carpenter roads in Kowloon City, were leaked and exposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said the leak covered the data of owners and tenants who registered for briefing sessions about the project and who filled out online registration forms stored on a cloud platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her office's probe found the URA and its contractor had failed to update a piece of software, generating the forms, to its latest version, which would have offered stronger protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said the URA also did not have a thorough understanding of the software, and therefore she ruled the development body had violated a legal clause on the security of data.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Privacy Commissioner found that the URA had not taken all practicable steps to ensure that the personal data involved was protected against unauthorised or accidental access, processing, erasure, loss or use," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner also updated her office's guide on the use of online cloud services as they become more popular.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include encrypting the personal data stored on cloud, ensuring that only authorised persons can access the data, and ensuring that service providers delete or return the data held when the service contract is over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The URA said in response it would study the commissioner's report in detail, adding that it had implemented a series of measures to strengthen data protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include asking the contractor to give timely notifications on product updates, optimising the work flow on handling personal data and appointing a firm to conduct an information security audit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added it would seek to minimise the chances of a repeat of similar incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The URA will] strive to establish a more robust privacy security framework and a corporate culture that values the protection of personal data," it said in a statement.

    'Obey law while investigating public housing misuse'

<div class="itemFullText">
 People who want to report illegal public housing use must gather information on their own and ensure their own safety as well as comply with the law, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Report Public Housing Abuse Award scheme kicks off on Wednesday and informants can get rewards of up to HK$3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing minister said authorities expect to receive 2,600 reports each year, with half of them having concrete evidence to back up their claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was also asked on an RTHK radio programme whether she supports people making audio or video recordings as part of their investigations.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In any event we have to ensure our own safety and follow the law, before we use our observations or other methods to get the information. A working group will follow up on the submitted information and see if such materials are useful. We have an assembly panel chaired by a directorate-ranked colleague, and government officials on the panel will make the final decision,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho stressed that existing Well-off Tenants Policies have been effective in tackling public housing abuse, as about 480,000 voluntary declarations were made since October 2023, with almost 6,000 tenants handing back their units.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think overall we just want people to stay alert. We don’t [want to] solely rely on the reward scheme [to tackle public housing misuse]. But we hope people understand public housing is a public resource. Many are on the wait list,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Ho also disagreed the informant scheme would be a detriment to neighbourly relations, saying those who use public housing inappropriately, like subletting their units, should bear the responsibility for any disharmony.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that people have to provide their real name when reporting cases and be interviewed to avoid abusing the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who don’t want a cash reward can stay anonymous.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists have found new evidence of an ‘extremely rare’ type of otter in waters north of Lantau – an area where they were previously believed to have been locally extinct since the 1960s.
 <br>
  <br>
  Conservationists didn’t directly spot the Eurasian Otter – thought to be one of the rarest mammals in Hong Kong – but instead confirmed their presence in the area via genetic tests on a one-dollar-coin-sized pile of dried faeces found on East Brother Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a
  <a href="https://iucnosgbull.org/Volume41/Hui_et_al_2024.html" target="_blank">
   paper
  </a>
  published last month, researchers from the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden said the finding expands the known range of the mammals in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The otters have have previously been found in coastal wetlands and rivers mostly in the northwestern part of the New Territories, but now the new data suggests they're also active in offshore islands and the marine environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this study,” the scientists wrote, “We present the first verifiable evidence of Eurasian Otter in Lantau waters, supporting the possibility that they may inhabit a wider area in Hong Kong and bringing new hope for this locally extremely rare species.”
  <br>
  <br>
  They say as Eurasian Otters depend on freshwater for drinking and washing, it’s likely they live along the northern coast of Lantau, and only use offshore islets as part of their hunting and nesting grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The researchers added that the importance of marine habitats to local otters has "long been neglected”, and their findings highlight the importance of carefully evaluating the impact of future development projects in North Lantau on the otters.

 People who report illegal public housing use can earn up to HK$3,000 starting from January 15 if their information helps authorities evict tenants who break the rules, the Housing Authority announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the authority said the Report Public Housing Abuse Award scheme aims to safeguard the use of public housing resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  People aged 16 or above can report any misuse through multiple channels, including online forms, hotlines, email and estate offices.
  <br>
  <br>
  An assessment panel will review cases and make final decisions, especially for complicated situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said the identities of informants will be kept confidential, though they must provide their real name when reporting and be interviewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the HA [Housing Authority] implemented new measures to enhance combating tenancy abuse, cases that are relatively easy to detect have been discovered. To identify remaining hidden cases, more investigative clues from the public are needed," the statement read.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's panda craze is picking up speed, thanks to the launch of a panda-themed high-speed rail train by the MTR Corporation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting from Saturday, passengers travelling to Shenzhen or Guangzhou will be treated to cartoon illustrations of pandas striking playful poses and indulging in Hong Kong delicacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the furry creatures are set against iconic Hong Kong landmarks, including the Big Buddha and the Convention and Exhibition Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [pandas] will act as travel ambassadors," MTR general manager Annie Leung told a media briefing on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[They will] showcase some rich and unique aspects of Hong Kong to the travellers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launch of the panda-themed high-speed train followed the debut of similar trains on the South Island Line and Airport Express in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trains are part of a broader citywide celebration tied to Ocean Park's giant pandas, which aims to promote local tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newly-adorned train will run for 12 weeks until April 4.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Travel Industry Council has expressed mixed views towards inbound and outbound tourism for the upcoming Lunar New Year break.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tommy Tam, who was elected as the council’s new chairman last month, described the prospects of inbound tourism during the holiday period as "good".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong can expect an influx of individual mainland visitors and travellers from Southeast Asian countries, courtesy of the high-speed rail link and short-haul flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm confident it will be better than before," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tam is less upbeat with outbound tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said some Hong Kong people may not be able to book high-speed train tickets due to the Spring Festival rush on the mainland, contributing to a drop in outbound tour groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam also said some may have trouble securing flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The long-haul flight resumption is still under progress, so if there are not sufficient long-haul flights, this may cause high fares and the limited seats supply.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the council expressed confidence in the tourism sector in the coming year, saying that the industry will have more opportunities, such as mega events and large-scale sports activities held in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will continue to attract more new blood to the trade, especially young people, in order to reach the goal of having 210,000 workers in five years’ time.

    HK to send 74 athletes to Asian Winter Games in Harbin

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR will send its largest-ever delegation of 74 athletes to compete at the Asian Winter Games, which will be held in Harbin from the 7th to the 14th of next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a flag presentation ceremony on Wednesday, cultural and sports minister Rosanna Law said the Hong Kong, China team demonstrates the vitality and passion of the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the government has been making continuous efforts to train elite athletes, with the Sports Institute providing funding and support services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who will lead the 100-strong local delegation, said the youngest athlete is just 15 and Hong Kong will compete in curling for the very first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, the lawmaker said preparation hasn't been easy for the SAR athletes due to weather conditions and venue limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have our natural constraints. No matter with the hardware, software, and also our weather. It's very hard for an athlete to persistently do high-level training within Hong Kong itself. So we can already see their determination. Being able to represent Hong Kong is already a feat in itself," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok added that mainland provinces have provided strong support for athletes who need to train overseas or on the mainland.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said it’s considering further ways to combat ticket scalping, including possible legislation to ban the practice at government-owned venues.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written response to a question from lawmaker Chan Kin-por, culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said legislative options would be considered “in a prudent manner” – noting that such a move has both pros and cons, “given the multiple causes of ticket scalping, which involve various factors including supply and demand, market structure, regulation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that although real-name registration for ticket buyers has helped, not all organisers want to adopt this measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to communicate with stakeholders, because different organisers have their different ticketing considerations," Law said during a Legislative Council session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though I think real-name registration for tickets is the most effective way to tackle the issue of scalpers, the organisers often don't consider this to be their first option. We have to respect such business operations."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also called on spectators to buy tickets through official channels, saying it's risky to buy through unauthorised means, especially at heightened prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official records show that no one was convicted of ticket scalping near concert venues between 2022 and the first half of last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers have expressed concern that scalping has become more rampant, saying Hong Kong's image could be at stake when tourists buy problematic tickets.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said Hong Kong's doors are wide open to professionals and businesses from Indonesia, adding the SAR has a lot to offer as a "super connector" between the mainland and the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a symposium in Jakarta, Chan said Hong Kong and Indonesia are "ideal partners" and Indonesian companies are welcome to set up headquarters in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong plays a pivotal role in facilitating foreign investment into the Chinese mainland, serving as the largest source of overseas direct investment in the whole of China and a crucial gateway for channelling foreign capital into the Chinese economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief noted that Hong Kong's securities market has a capitalisation of over US$4.4 trillion, and pools both mainland and international capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In other words, any Indonesian company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be able to tap into both mainland and international capital," Chan said.

    'Plan to build homes gave arts hub a lifeline'

<img alt="Bernard Chan, vice-chairman of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, says the proposed housing project will be crucial to maintain the arts hub's operations. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786632_1_20250108160319.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government decision last year allowing the sale of commercial and residential facilities at the West Kowloon arts hub gave the cash-strapped project a shot in the arm, the vice-chairman of its managing authority said.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of a funding proposal, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority on Wednesday said it plans to build seven residential blocks south of Austin Road West that could offer nearly 2,000 flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the government endorsed the sale of residential developments within Zone 2 of the site by the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That news itself already helped us a great deal," Bernard Chan, the authority's vice-chairman, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It allowed us to talk to the bankers... The fact that we now potentially have a future income stream coming from the sale of these residential units, we're able to get refinancing and we can generate the necessary funding... to allow the authority to continue to operate."
  <br>
  <br>
  That, Chan said, helped to overcome a "timing mismatch" with the development of arts and culture facilities outpacing that of commercial and residential sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The faster we open our new [arts and culture] facilities, the more losses we will incur. In the meantime, our income has yet to materialise, because we haven't really been able to generate any income from our commercial sites," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was always, from day one, the plan to use the commercial, residential area to subsidise the arts and culture offerings. This residential [area] is actually going to help us to finance the investment that we put in the arts and culture sites."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said the residential project will help the arts hub stay afloat for at least a decade.

    'Boost tourism at cruise terminal, Sports Park'
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said officials are exploring ways to enhance the operation of the cruise terminal and optimise the use of Kai Tak Sports Park to boost tourism in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  During the first antechamber exchange session of the year, Law said she received valuable feedback and suggestions regarding the new tourism blueprint, with officials and members in attendance including Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk and Legco President Andrew Leung.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her expectations for the new operator of the terminal would significantly improve its performance, adding that she also hopes to improve the use of the shoreline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no 'the best situation', there is only better operation. So this is my constant expectation, and in the new tendering exercise, of course we will be reviewing the criteria imposed so far. After all, the cruise terminal has been in operation for more than 10 years and the same operator has been operating the terminal," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know that society and, of course, myself and my colleagues in the CSTB (Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau) have different views on the operation of the cruise terminal and how it might be improved."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also noted that she had received insights and suggestions on how to enhance Kai Tak Sports Park's potential as a world-class venue for mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho told RTHK it is necessary for greater collaboration with local investment groups interested in funding sporting events at Kai Tak Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The infrastructure, the hardware is fantastic. I've been to that already. Right now, I think that it all comes down to kind of software, what kind of events are we going to be hosting, the frequency of the event that we'll be hosting, the quality of it, and also how do we maintain this kind of standard throughout the years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've got the big stadium, 50,000 people capable, and the smaller arena, you can have 10,000 plus people. So obviously, the scale of it is huge. In hosting this kind of scale of events, we need to engage local sports community to have athletes, organisers and all that, but more at the same time, sponsors as well as sort of investors too. I think that we need to ramp that up in a very near future."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who is also vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, praised the transportation arrangements and crowd management during the recent test events at the Sports Park, but noted the importance of addressing additional issues, such as dining options, to maximise the potential of the local sports economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another DAB member, Brave Chan, suggested that officials should permit more private vehicles from the mainland to enter Hong Kong during holidays. He also recommended extending docking times for international and mainland private yachts and cruise ships to attract more tourists to the SAR.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung and his son Ricky Chim will be sentenced on February 3 over a fraud case.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court heard their mitigation on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud more than HK$42 million in transactions linked to a listed company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court earlier convicted Chim Pui-chung, who was the largest shareholder of Asia Resources, and his 55-year-old son, who was the chairman, for conspiring with mainland businessman Ma Zhonghong to defraud the company, its board and shareholders between July 2013 and November 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman, Wong Poe-lai, was convicted of money laundering in connection with the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chim Pui-chung, 78, submitted more than 10 mitigation letters to the court, including letters from former Legco president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing and former financial secretary John Tsang.
  <br>
  <br>
  His defence lawyer also said his client is in poor health. He had suffered from throat cancer, heart disease and a stroke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Ernest Lin adjourned the case to February 3 for sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three defendants were remanded in custody until sentencing next month.

    West Kowloon arts hub outlines residential development

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The managing authority of the West Kowloon arts hub has outlined plans to build seven residential blocks that could offer nearly 2,000 private sector flats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Located south of Austin Road West, the proposed development also includes three multi-purpose basement levels and three other storeys above ground for retail, catering and entertainment, according to a document submitted to the Yau Tsim Mong District Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority said the development plan would take up roughly 20,000 square metres of land.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan would have a total gross floor area of 134,500 square metres, with some 80 percent coming from the residential project that's expected to provide up to 1,995 housing units.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing blocks would create a stepped profile to "maintain the decent views looking out from Hong Kong Island" to the waterfront in West Kowloon, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footbridges and walkways would be part of the plan, connecting the project with Kowloon MTR Station and Elements, the shopping mall nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority is planning to apply to the Town Planning Board for planning permission in the first quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July last year, the Executive Council conditionally agreed to a funding proposal to allow the authority to sell some of its land parcels and keep all proceeds received from tenders to private developers to ease a financial shortfall.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Professor Dennis Lo, the ninth Vice-Chancellor and President of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said he will strive to enhance the institution's international status.
 <br>
  <br>
  Assuming office on Wednesday, Lo said he was honoured to take up the role, and would work hard to enhance quality in teaching, research, services, and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo, who's also a molecular biologist, revealed he would meet with his team this week, and arrange meetings with staff, students and alumni later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said he would strengthen exchanges with the governing council that was reformed two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of members were reduced from 55 to 34, while the ratio of external to internal members was changed to 2:1 from 1:1 in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think communication is very important. Therefore, our management team will have frequent and regular exchanges with the governing council," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important thing is that all of us know that both the management team and governing council want CUHK to be better, and to enhance CHUK's international status."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo noted that a documentary by the university's student publication on district-level care teams had caught the attention of society.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the publication offered a chance for students to obtain hands-on experience, adding it was also a learning opportunity for them given their story had generated so many different opinions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Succeeding Rocky Tuan, Lo's term will run for five years.

    Govt urges changes to tap into silver economy

<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk has called for changes to cater to the city's ageing population, saying the rising number of elderly individuals offers “tremendous" market potential.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk is leading a working group on promoting the silver economy to address the growing needs of the elderly population.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, the minister said Hong Kong could reference measures in other places, such as the mainland, Japan, and South Korea, to support those aged 65 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged businesses to "find their niche" and tap into the potential that the silver economy offers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seniors are a very huge market. For people selling goods or services, they must cater to their customers' preferences... If businesses want to sell products to the elderly, they must make changes," Cheuk said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, there should naturally be a designated area for a silver economy, for people to find food, healthcare products, and things that are suitable for the elderly. This is bound to happen, so I'm not worried whether the industry would cooperate on this or not."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans for the silver economy with measures to boost consumption among the elderly, promote industrialisation of products, and encourage seniors to return to the labour force.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank said on Tuesday it is making good progress in recruiting donors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The milk bank's director, Rosanna Wong, said it has received more than 100 calls from potential donors since the launch of the facility's website in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the opening of our website, we have actually received a lot of phone calls. More than 100 potential moms have already contacted us. So after today, we are going to contact them, actively support them, hopefully they could be donors at the end," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The facility, located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital, started operation on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It aims to collect 1,000 litres of milk a year, which Wong said would require 150 to 200 donors, each contributing at least 5 litres.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the annual target is met, it can be supplied to 450 to 600 premature babies born before 32 weeks, or critically-ill newborns in nine public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A donor, Yoyo Chan, who has an eight-month-old daughter, said she wants to help other premature babies after two previous miscarriages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I know that there's a breast milk bank, I decided to do it because I want to bless and contribute to the premature babies. At least I can do something to help them," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The facility's advanced practice nurse Christine Lam said a face-to-face interview will be conducted with prospective donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  To qualify as donors, the mothers must be healthy, must not smoke nor drink alcohol, and are currently breastfeeding a baby under one year old.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will also have to take a blood test once every three months, and to inform staff of the facility whether they are taking medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The milk bank will offer milk bottles and pouches to donors and arrange couriers to collect their milk.

    Govt to put up Tung Chung residential site for tender
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Tuesday said she is reasonably optimistic that a residential site put up for tender this quarter will be successful, adding it is too early to predict whether the annual land sales income target can be met.
 <br>
  <br>
  The parcel earmarked for sale in Tung Chung, which will provide around 745 flats, was first put up for tender in September 2023 but was unsuccessful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the last land sale programme for the 2024/25 fiscal year, Linn said the government had been listening to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have heard views from the real estate industry, suggesting that the government should roll out simpler, smaller-sized [plots] with fewer requirements on site formation and government facilities," Linn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The tender] is in line with such market expectations as it attaches very simple tender conditions and no requirement to construct government facilities. Moreover, as the site sits on reclaimed land, the development is not required to conduct any further site formation works, which may help reduce the development cost."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the parcel was originally not part of the land sale programme for this fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if she was confident the annual land sales revenue target of HK$33 billion could be met, Linn said it was still too early to make a conclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development chief said the administration had been listening to developers about the type of site that was in demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remain pragmatic and prudent in selecting the kind of land that we would like to roll out. When we know that the appetite of the market is for smaller sites, simpler sites, we are exactly moving along that direction, and that would help enliven the market and rekindle their interest in coming forward to bid for sites," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking into account various land sources, Linn said the land supply for the fourth quarter can provide around 1,100 new private residential units.

 Various local attractions such as the giant panda will feature prominently in the upcoming Lunar New Year parade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The parade will be held on the evening of January 29, the first day of the Year of the Snake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board and sponsored by Cathay Pacific, it will feature nine floats and 46 performing groups from 14 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Many floats will even act as Hong Kong tourism ambassadors, featuring authentic elements of the city, such as the giant pandas. They will make an impressive appearance together with local famous food, such as milk tea,” Tourism Board chairman Pang Yiu-kai told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The K-pop girl group Kep1er and Thai boy band LYKN are among those invited to perform at the parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay’s chief executive officer Ronald Lam said the city's flagship carrier is committed to promoting mega events in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This parade is a platform for international cultural exchange. We have groups from different countries, gathering here and performing for local people and tourists, allowing everyone to experience the festive atmosphere with the characteristics of Hong Kong,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parade will start at 8pm at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, proceeding along Canton Road, Haiphong Road and Nathan Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets will be on sale from January 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board said the parade will kick off a series of festive celebrations across Hong Kong, including a fireworks display on January 30, Lunar New Year horse racing on January 31 and the Chinese New Year Cup football match on February 1.

    Govt enhances New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said its enhancement measures to the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme will attract more people, as well as promote the development of family offices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting in March, applicants will only need to prove they have a minimum net worth of HK$30 million in the six months before applying, rather than the original period of two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will also consider the total amount of net assets that applicants are absolutely beneficially entitled to within their family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the scheme, applicants must invest a minimum of HK$30 million within the six-month time limit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will also recognise investments made by private enterprises that are wholly owned by applicants as eligible investment, but the companies must be incorporated or registered in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe these measures will encourage more investors to join the scheme and can create synergy with the tax concession regime for family offices, thereby promoting the development of family office businesses in Hong Kong," the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are committed to providing comprehensive support for family office decision-makers to establish themselves in Hong Kong, further attracting global asset owners and reinforcing Hong Kong's leading position as an international asset and wealth management hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 800 applications have been received since the scheme was implemented last March, and the government expects over HK$24 billion of investment will be brought into the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpha Lau, Director-General of Investment Promotion, pointed out that the number of applications in the first 10 months since the implementation has surpassed the same period under the previous Capital Investment Entrant Scheme that was launched in 2003.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I trust that these measures will enhance the attractiveness of the scheme. We will continue to work closely with professionals and service providers to further promote the scheme to high-net-worth families around the globe," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong was confident the new measures would attract more wealthy people to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope that Hong Kong would attract more than 5,000 applications, bring in more than HK$150 billion of investment, set up more and more companies or family offices here,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The investors from all over the world, who expect Hong Kong's advantages, for example, safety, low tax, and [connectivity] to the mainland market - those investors will get benefits in the near future.”
  <br>
  <br>
  But the founder of the Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association added the scheme had room to grow in terms of attracting more applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There's room for improvement. For example, HK$24 billion is a lot of money, but I noticed that this is only a forecast number. We hope the government help these investors complete their investments as soon as possible. We know there is still a long way to go from waiting for investment to completing the investment. I think 800 applications is not ideal,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shang said the government should provide more assistance to help investors settle in the SAR and expand into the mainland.
