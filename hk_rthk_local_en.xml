<div class="itemFullText">
 Popular sushi chain Sushiro on Wednesday expressed concern after a video showing a boy apparently putting a communal tong in his mouth at one of its restaurants was circulated online.
 <br>
  <br>
  The video showed the boy playing with a tong – used to pick up slices of ginger – with his hand and mouth, before dropping the utensil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All ginger slice containers and ginger slice tongs in the store have been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected," Sushiro said in a statement in response to the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sushiro Hong Kong severely condemns this behaviour and will seriously respond to this incident, including taking relevant legal actions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chain also said it will reconsider the way it provides cutlery and plates, adding it will strictly implement quality control measures.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A five-year-old girl who suffered a cardiac arrest during a suturing procedure at Yan Chai Hospital last May has died, the Hospital Authority said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lai Sum-yuet had been in intensive care in Princess Margaret Hospital since her heart stopped beating for 18 minutes while she was being given stitches for a head wound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two staff members were later charged with ill-treatment or neglect over the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the Kowloon West hospital cluster said the girl's condition deteriorated earlier this week and she died on Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman expressed deep sadness over the death, adding that the cluster will do what it can to help the girl's family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital cluster takes this incident very seriously and will fully cooperate with relevant judicial proceedings. The case has been referred to the coroner for follow-up," the spokesman said.

    People frustrated with postal suspension from HK to US

<img alt="Some at the General Post Office in Central said they were baffled by the sudden changes. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790377_1_20250205163532.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 People in Hong Kong who wish to send mail to the United States expressed their frustration at the situation on Wednesday, after the US stopped receiving parcels from mainland China and the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States Postal Service announced on Tuesday that it was temporarily suspending inbound parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong until further notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkong Post's website showed postal services regarding packets and parcels to the US were temporarily not available. But people could still mail letters to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman at the General Post Office in Central said she was baffled by the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sending a gift to my son in college. They said I can't send a package, I can only send a letter. I'm not happy. I'm going to try SF Express and DHL," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman said she wanted to send a card and a congratulatory gift after her friend in the US had a baby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They weren't sure why, what happened. They just said it's suspended for now. I'm going to find somewhere else and see if I can send it another way," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK reached out to various international shipping companies, and DHL's customer service office said it was still accepting packages to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the company said guidelines are updated every half an hour and things may change.
  <br>
  <br>
  FedEx and UPS, meanwhile, said postal services were not affected, but it may take a longer time for parcels to arrive in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrangement came after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods, and scrapped a duty-free exemption policy for low-value packages.

    Extra US tariffs on Chinese imports also cover HK

<img alt="The Hong Kong Shippers' Council said it was surprised that SAR goods are also subject to the latest US tariffs. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790374_1_20250205161715.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The additional 10 percent tariffs slapped on Chinese imports by US President Donald Trump also apply to Hong Kong, officials say.
 <br>
  <br>
  The confirmation came in a notice from US Customs and Border Protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday said the vast majority of goods from the SAR are now subject to the extra 10 percent tariffs, on top of regular and other potential extra duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is also affected by Washington's move to end the "de minimis" exemption that meant US shoppers didn't have to pay tariffs for shipments with a retail value of US$800 or less, the HKTDC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted that the US imported US$4.1 billion worth of goods from Hong Kong in 2023, with the duties paid totalling US$58 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the additional 10 percent duty in place, Hong Kong products would have faced US$411.6 million in additional duty liability in 2023, while mainland Chinese products would have faced US$42,081 million in additional duty liability," the HKTDC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, Willy Lin, said he had been caught off-guard by Hong Kong's inclusion in the latest trade spat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong customs and US customs do work very, very closely together to fight crime and fight drugs etc. We were quite surprised to see that Hong Kong was being labelled," Lin told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think a 10 percent tariff is not really detrimental to Hong Kong, but it is reputation-wise," he said, adding that people will question why the SAR is being targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the extra tariffs, Trump said China needed to stop the flow of fentanyl, a deadly opioid, into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has rejected accusations of complicity in the fentanyl trade and in response to Trump's move it has imposed tariffs of its own on multiple US products, while also announcing it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization.

    Broken down train disrupts East Rail Line services

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An equipment fault that stranded an engineer's train near Tai Wo MTR Station disrupted services on the East Rail Line on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some stations saw 24-minute intervals between trains during the morning rush hour, with crowd management measures put in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation apologised for the disruption. Shortly after 1pm it said the train had been moved away from the area and normal services were resuming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Kim-hung, the railway firm's chief of operations engineering maintenance, said the equipment fault was related to the train's levelling system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found one of the sensors in the levelling system to be faulty, so we had to get it fixed and to make sure that the train can operate safely on the way back," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some passengers RTHK spoke to said the disruption to their journey was minimal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because I already learned about [the disruption] early in the morning after paying attention to the news before going to work, so there wasn't a problem for me," a woman surnamed Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A passenger surnamed Yim said he expected a bit of a delay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am not in a rush, so it isn't much of an issue... I think I'll be half an hour late," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said it asked the railway firm to "make all-out efforts to follow up and complete the necessary maintenance" to resume normal service as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [department's] Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre has been closely monitoring the traffic conditions and public transport services of various districts and affected stations," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bus companies beefed up services for some routes in response to the extra passenger demand.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Wednesday said the number of flu cases was still on the rise and expected the flu season to last until March or April.
 <br>
  <br>
  The CHP recorded about 200 serious or death cases involving adults since the start of the year, in which 65 percent of them were elderly people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The controller of the CHP, Edwin Tsui, said the influenza A, sub-type H1, virus is currently circulating in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many Hong Kong people travel abroad. We cannot focus only on the situation in the SAR, we also have to look into the influenza strains in other countries," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Popular tourist destinations, like Japan, South Korea, Europe, North America and the mainland, are currently also having cases of influenza A (H1)."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsui expects the number of cases to continue rising, and urged people to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the flu season for other countries in January every year. People travel abroad, and when they come back from their holidays, there may be outbreaks at schools and workplaces," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged people to go and see the doctor immediately if they are sick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, family doctor Lam Wing-wo said the number of appointments for flu vaccinations doubled after the Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said about 20 people have made appointments for flu vaccines every day, and some belonged to the relatively low-risk age group of 18 to 50.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there is a sufficient supply of vaccines, and urged parents to bring their children to clinics for flu jabs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Businesses in Hong Kong are prepared for the latest round of 10 percent tariffs that Washington imposed on Beijing, according to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme on Wednesday, HKGCC CEO Patrick Yeung said the new tariffs would affect the region, as they could disrupt global supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But in recent years, Hong Kong's exports have actually become very diversified, and the markets that Hong Kong exporters deal with has also been expanded," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So in this context, we believe that the Hong Kong export sector is already relatively prepared, at least psychologically, because President Trump has already said that there will be a tariff war, and it's just started right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung noted with the SAR expanding into new markets, particularly Asean and the Middle East, and achieving positive growth, it has partially helped offset the decline in trade due to the imposition of US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hunter Chan, Greater China economist at Standard Chartered, told the same show that compared to the previous trade war that took place during Trump's first presidency, Chinese exporters are more prepared this time round.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects the tariffs to cause a drop of about one percentage point in Chinese GDP in the coming 12 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economist noted that some Chinese exporters to the US have relocated their factories overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also re-exported to other places to avoid tariffs, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said while market sentiment remains cautious, investors are still hoping there will be positive results from any potential talks between Trump and President Xi Jinping.

    SAR eyes next-gen wealth owners in family office push

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is looking to tap the next generation of wealth owners in its push to promote the SAR as a place for family offices, according to treasury chief Christopher Hui.
 <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for financial services and the treasury also said many family offices have to better allocate their assets in this multipolar world, a trend Hong Kong needs to take note of.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Hui said the territory has an institute – the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy – catering to successors of affluent families who are set to inherit and manage wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not looking for people who are already in power, but those who will potentially be in leadership roles. [The academy] provides them with exchange opportunities, allowing them to learn about Hong Kong's investment opportunities and management of financial legacies," Hui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said his bureau and data company Bloomberg have teamed up for an initiative, called Hong Kong Family Office Nexus, to lure family offices from around the world to either set up shop in the SAR, or expand their presence here.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bloomberg would hold a wealth management conference that will "create synergy" with the Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit next month, according to Hui.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added Hong Kong is on track to meet the official target of attracting at least 200 new family offices by this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Tuesday announced that the Kai Tak Sports Park's main stadium will officially open on March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau made the announcement on social media, where it said the 50,000-seat facility will be a “top choice venue” for international sports tournaments and large-scale entertainment events.
  <br>
  <br>
  British band Coldplay will perform there on April 9, 11, and 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, about 50,000 people participated in a drill at the sports park on Tuesday night, when the main stadium's retractable roof opened for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They watched a Hong Kong Premier League U22 match between Kitchee and North District.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the roof open, the Environmental Protection Department also monitored audio levels to see if the noise generated at the venue could affect nearby residents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism minister Rosanna Law on Tuesday said 4.74 million tourists visited Hong Kong last month, with 3.73 million of them coming from the mainland, setting new single-month records since the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on economic development, Law said the figures represent a 24 and 25 percent year-on-year rise respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said Hong Kong saw a “good start” in the Year of the Snake after the territory received more than 1.2 million tourists in the first seven days of the mainland’s Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the first seven days of this year’s mainland Spring Festival golden week, the visitor arrivals reached nearly 1.25 million, including 1.06 mainland visitors and over 180,000 non-mainland visitors. The overall hotel occupancy rate reached 90 percent,” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over 2,000 tour groups had visited Hong Kong including more than 440 tours on Friday, setting the highest single-day record for mainland tour groups visiting Hong Kong,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said bustling crowds were seen at major tourist attractions, with visitors enjoying various districts and taking part in mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that events like the new year fairs, the night parade, fireworks display, horse racing, the LNY Cup, as well as attractions like temples and hiking trails, have brought tourists unique and festive experiences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said she is confident there will be more visitors coming to Hong Kong this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hongkonger who was recently freed from a scam farm in Myanmar is in "good mental and physical condition" and has returned to the SAR on Tuesday, officials confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Accompanied by members of a government task force, the woman flew out of Thailand and arrived in Hong Kong on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to our understanding, this Hong Kong resident did not pay any ransom," Assistant Secretary for Security Paddy Yuen, who was part of the task force, told reporters at the Hong Kong International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is highly concerned about these cases and have maintained communication with the Hongkongers who need help and their families. We have also collaborated with Thailand, and followed up on the cases with Myanmar and Cambodia," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement released earlier, the Security Bureau said "its dedicated task force met with the Hong Kong resident in Bangkok this morning and was delighted to find that she was in good mental and physical condition".
  <br>
  <br>
  "She expressed gratitude for the active coordination and liaison of the dedicated task force with relevant units of the Thai authorities, as well as for the assistance of different parties that enabled her to return to Hong Kong shortly after her rescue to reunite with her family as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the bureau would continue to actively follow up on the remaining cases of SAR residents still believed to be held captive in Southeast Asia.

    Cut taxes to get international stars to HK: institute

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Taxation Institute on Tuesday urged Financial Secretary Paul Chan to provide more tax incentives to attract international singers and sports stars to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the budget later this month, the institute proposed a 50 percent reduction in tax rates for non-local entertainers and sportspeople, and a tax deduction of up to 200 percent for filming activities in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ada Ma, a council member of the institute, said these measures would boost the hotel and retail sectors and promote the new Kai Tak stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year we talked about a lot of entertainers or sportspeople who went to Singapore or other countries to hold concerts. And there's some debate about why they don't come to Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just want to encourage them to come to Hong Kong from a tax angle, not just to compare with other countries, but we also want to promote our stadium in Kai Tak and also other businesses in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The institute also suggested that the top marginal salaries tax rate be lowered to 16 percent from 17 percent, and that the standard tax rate be increased from 16 to 17 percent for those earning above HK$5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winnie Shek, the institute's president, said they would also like to see the waiving of stamp duty for first-time homebuyers for properties up to HK$6.5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's part of the proposal that we advocate to improve the livelihood of Hong Kong general public. So the Hong Kong general public, probably the younger generation in Hong Kong, are still experiencing difficulties in buying their first home," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With an estimated HK$100 billion fiscal deficit this year, the institute said it's not the best time to introduce new taxes given the uncertain global economic landscape.

<img alt="Chris Tang said the legal changes would further clarify the criminal liability of such a serious offence." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790219_1_20250204160658.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it plans to double the maximum penalty for illegally manufacturing and trafficking firearms to up to 20 years behind bars.
 <br>
  <br>
  This is to bring local laws in line with a United Nations firearms protocol, which began to apply in the country, including the SAR, early last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang said to reflect the seriousness of the crime, officials plan to make manufacturing firearms, their components and ammunition a separate offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No person should manufacture firearms or ammunition unless they're doing it by way of trade or business, or holds a dealer's licence. As this may be a national security threat, we will enhance the prison term to 20 years instead of 10," he said at a security panel meeting at the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told lawmakers that in the past five years, the authorities uncovered complete firearms on 12 occasions, while detecting two cases of firearm manufacturing and three cases of illegal imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the new offence would cover those who use 3D printing techniques to manufacture a legitimate firearm, while those who print air guns without a licence could be subject to punishment under existing laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government plans to table a bill to the legislature in April, and complete the legal changes within this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Hong Kong rallied more than three percent in the morning session, in line with an advance across Asian markets after Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada reached deals to delay US tariffs for a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index rallied 3.11 percent in the morning session, or 629 points, to 20,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets were sent tumbling on Monday after the US president at the weekend signed off 25 percent duties against Mexico and Canada, fanning concerns for the stuttering global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, investors were given a much-needed shot in the arm after the Trump administration said it had struck deals with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on immigration and fentanyl, and would postpone the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump added he would hold talks with Beijing "probably in the next 24 hours" to avoid new 10 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese markets remain closed due to the Lunar New Year holiday. (AFP)

 People wrapped up warm on Tuesday as local temperatures fell to 12 degrees Celsius.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said districts like Tai Po, Tuen Mun and Sha Tin saw temperatures lower than that.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said an intense northeast monsoon is bringing cold weather to the coast of Guangdong, which is why temperatures dipped on Tuesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man told RTHK he wasn't too bothered by the colder weather, but made sure he wrapped up warm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very cold. It's much colder than I expected, but it's still pleasant right now. I've got to make sure I'm wearing two to three layers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another person hoped it would get warmer again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't like this. I feel more comfortable with warmer weather," she said.

  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection reminded the public, especially the elderly and people with chronic illnesses, to protect their health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Elderly people have less insulating fat beneath their skin to keep them warm, and their body temperature control mechanisms may be weaker. Their body may not be able to appropriately respond to the cold weather," a spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters said temperatures would rise slightly in the coming few days, but would drop again over the weekend.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Tuesday said government departments should study ways to reduce spending to tackle a fiscal deficit estimated to be just below HK$100 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang told a radio programme that the government should review the size and work of the civil service to save public money.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, among more than 2,000 civil servants in the Labour Department, around 600 of them are working on employment services, which are not related to law enforcement. For employment services, shouldn't we consider outsourcing them to the third sector?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the Labour Department spends around HK$600 to HK$800 million annually on employment services, but some work could be delegated to non-profit organisations instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Liberal Party chairman Peter Shiu said the administration should look for ways to cut spending on education and healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our birth rate is very low. We now have around half as many children as we did a decade ago. But we don't see primary education fees being reduced by half. Instead, it keeps going up every year. We need to look into this," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On whether HK$2 subsidised transport fares for the over 60s should be adjusted, Tang said he thinks distance-based fares should be implemented instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Shiu said officials could consider setting usage limits or excluding some people still in work from getting the subsidised fares, depending on which sector they are employed in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan will deliver his budget speech on February 26.

    Hong Kong's economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2024

<img alt="Hong Kong's economy slowed to 2.5 percent in 2024 from 3.2 percent in 2023. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790114_1_20250203175503.jpg&q=10">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent in 2024, officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure matched government forecasts, but was down from the 3.2 percent growth recorded in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed a relatively faster pace of growth in the last quarter of 2024 – at 2.4 percent year-on-year – compared to 1.9 percent in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, a government spokesperson said the economy is expected to register further growth in 2025, despite heightened uncertainties in the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said while US "protectionist policies" could affect Hong Kong's exports, supportive measures from Beijing will help offset some of the impact and the authorities will continue to take various measures to spur growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Terence Chong, an economics professor at Chinese University, said the city's latest growth was partially driven by stimulus measures from Beijing last September, as well as supportive policies in Chief Executive John Lee's Policy Address last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fourth quarter performance was actually much better than the third quarter's, basically it was driven by the exports of services and also by the government expenditure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if you look at the consumption and also investment, they dropped."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said falling retail sales are among the most concerning components weighing on the SAR's growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, we may [also] expect some reductions in the export sectors, because of the trade tensions between the US and other economies like China," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said he expects Hong Kong's annual economic growth to swing between two and four percent in the coming year, as a declining property sector gradually stabilises due to interest rate cuts boosting transaction volumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say that the property markets have reached the bottom and the sector will bounce back in the first half of 2025," he said, adding that the city's stock markets are also picking up steam.

    Retail sales drop for 10th consecutive month

<img alt="A government spokesman says retail sales declined further in December, partly due to more Hong Kong residents travelling abroad during the holidays. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790100_1_20250203170154.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales dropped 9.7 percent in December year-on-year, marking the 10th consecutive month of declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to figures from the Census and Statistics Department released on Monday, the value of total retail sales in December was estimated at HK$32.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decrease followed a revised 7.3 percent fall in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw a sharp decline of 36.3 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 22 percent fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said retail sales declined further in December, partly due to more Hong Kong residents travelling abroad during the holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the provisional data showed retail sales for the whole of 2024 decreased by 7.3 percent when compared with the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it said the retail sector would benefit due to various measures introduced by the central government and proactive efforts by the SAR authorities to promote tourism, boost market sentiment and increase employment earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bond Law, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, said while the sector is expecting a continuous decline in business for January and February, there is some cause for optimism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is hope for the increased business from mainland tourists, especially with the resumption of the multiple-entry individual visit scheme for Shenzhen residents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Members are observing changes in tourist foot traffic, spending patterns and basket sizes. While foot traffic may increase, purchasing power remains weak and we need time to see the foot effects."

    'Prosecutions not the aim of housing abuse offence'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Monday that a plan to criminalise serious abuse of public housing  isn't about prosecuting people or getting them out of their homes, but ensuring the proper use of public resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under proposed legal changes, people deemed to have seriously abused their tenancy, such as subletting their flat or using it for commercial purposes, would risk a prison term of up to 12 months and a fine as high as HK$500,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said if all goes smoothly, officials plan to table the relevant bill to the legislature in the next quarter, with a view to the law coming into effect in the second quarter of next year at the earliest.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco housing panel meeting, she told lawmakers that tenants would be allowed to work from home, as long as business activities don't take place inside the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many people nowadays work from home. Also, many people are interested in making some handicrafts and they sell them somewhere else, instead of using the flat for commercial purposes. All these will be allowed," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said tenants won't be allowed to "run the flat like a tuition centre or a gym room" with many people going in and out or price lists available, even if they also live in the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  She called on tenants to exercise caution if they use the address for business registration purposes, because it might raise suspicions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed that the authorities will use common sense when they handle breaches of the rules.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of the annual Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon say they have attracted a vibrant crowd of international runners this year, with many elite athletes expected to be in attendance.
 <br>
  <br>
  74,000 runners are set to participate this Sunday, including over 15,000 international athletes from 101 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will also be 14 male and 10 female elite runners joining, primarily from Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Ng, executive director of Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, said there is much to look forward to at this year's event, including pre-marathon activities at Kai Tak Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-day expo kicks off on Wednesday, featuring more than 40 booths filled with games and photo opportunities, with the aim of attracting over 120,000 visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The basic function of the marathon expo would be for the runners to collect their runner's packs. Apart from that, we would like the runners as well as the public to experience the marathon atmosphere at the marathon expo," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can enjoy the booths from the sponsors, from the Hong Kong AAA or even from our beneficiaries in the marathon charity programme to learn more about the marathon history and what our beneficiaries are doing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The full and half marathons will start on Nathan Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, while the 10-kilometre race will begin at the Island Eastern Corridor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the 10-kilometre wheelchair race, wheelchair trial, and Leaders Cup will commence at Wan Chai Sports Ground, with all events finishing at Victoria Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Road closures will begin in phases starting from 11.30pm on Saturday and all the roads closed are expected to reopen by 2pm on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The full and half marathon race routes will lead to extensive temporary road closures in the Yau Tsim Mong area, including sections of Nathan Road and Argyle Street. The roads affected are expected to be open again by around 10.30am, depending on race progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the full marathon will utilise the Kowloon-bound carriageways of the Cheung Tsing Highway and related tunnels, resulting in vehicle diversions that may cause traffic congestion near North Lantau Highway and the Tsing Ma Bridge, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Public transport services will also face significant adjustments and the public are advised to travel by MTR.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Travel Industry Authority (TIA) said on Monday it was high time for the sector to consider whether it is necessary for tour guides to stand and talk on a moving coach.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after a guide was thrown out of a vehicle and died in a crash in Shanghai last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's executive director, Annie Fonda, said authorities there were still investigating, and the TIA would keep in contact with them to see what happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said agencies should study whether tour guides should be wearing their seat belts at all times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this incident, I think the trade can share their views about whether it's really necessary for tour guides to stand on a [moving] coach and speak to tour members," Fonda said on Commercial Radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Safety belts are important. Say, on airplanes, flight attendants can put on their seat belts while seated as they face passengers. These are things we can study."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added the guide was a freelancer and his company, Miramar Travel, had bought work insurance for his trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, unionist Lam Chi-ting agreed the sector could study fitting standing-room seat belts for tour guides.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the director of the Tourism Industry Employees' General Union said on RTHK that it's unavoidable that guides have to move around the vehicle, such as collecting travel documents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said he is cautiously optimistic about the city's stock market performance in the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  At an opening ceremony as the bourse began its first trading session of the new year, Chan noted that stocks saw their best performance in seven years during the Year of the Dragon, with the benchmark index rising more than 28 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said he has consulted several popular artificial intelligence large language models on the SAR's outlook for the coming 12 months and all suggested the markets will be "flexible, smooth and prosperous", despite external challenges including from geopolitics and trade tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the market outlook for the Year of the Snake, I am cautiously optimistic and happy to see a better performance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the strong support from the country, along with the cooperation between the SAR government, regulators, and the industry, we can actively and flexibly respond to challenges, seize opportunities and explore new ideas and measures to further enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of the city's listing platform, while pushing the city's finance industry to new heights," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Chan, chairman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) Carlson Tong said officials will continue to roll out new financial products, and will carry out reforms to woo investors and global enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite ongoing challenges, I'm optimistic about the coming year with the planned new product launches, multi-year platforms development, market reforms, and expansion of our international networks," Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year also marks the 25th anniversary of the HKEX, underscoring our commitment to innovation and growth," he added.

 A green group on Monday called on the government to build a reusable cup system at Kai Tak Sports Arena to reduce waste created at mega events.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after Greenpeace conducted a study during the Lunar New Year Cup that attracted some 20,000 people at Hong Kong Stadium on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They reviewed how many items of disposable cutlery and containers were given out among the five food vendors operating at the 16 shops which were open 45 minutes before the match started and during the intermission period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 12,000 disposable items were distributed during these time periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We used this data to amplify and estimate the number of disposable items that would be distributed by the Kai Tak sports centre in the coming year. We found that if there is a 100 percent occupancy rate [of 50,000 people] at 40 sports events yearly, there would be [more than] one million disposable items distributed to the audience,” said campaign officer Leanne Tam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam said the predictions did not include disposable paper cups provided at the 20 water fountains during previous trial events.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group urged the administration to allocate HK$10 million to develop a reusable cup service in which spectators can return the cup after events for washing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam said such services are not new to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the 2019 Rugby Sevens, Hong Kong tried to implement the reusable cup service. Greenpeace has also implemented a community programme to provide reusable cups to cafes two years ago, and we have successfully saved over 10,000 cups with 50 cafes,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added the government should take the lead in waste reduction and provide reusable cups for stores at the venue, so spectators can choose more environmentally friendly options.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung was on Monday sentenced to two years and 10 months in prison for conspiracy to defraud, over HK$42 million in transactions linked to a listed company.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court earlier convicted Chim, who was the largest shareholder of Asia Resources, and his son Ricky, who was the chairman, of conspiring with mainland businessman Ma Zhonghong to defraud the company, its board and shareholders between July 2013 and November 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case involved the issuance of convertible notes to increase the company's share capital while concealing a secret "shell company" agreement. Ma had agreed to pay the ex-lawmaker HK$210 million for 70 to 75 percent of Asia Resources' issued shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  The younger Chim was jailed for three years and one month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Poe-lai, a businesswoman and an associate of Ma, was convicted of money laundering in connection with the case and was jailed for two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passing sentence, judge Ernest Lin said Chim Pui-chung and his son not only harmed the interests of individual investors, but also hurt the SAR’s reputation as an international finance centre and shook investor confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said the starting point for the the former legislator's prison term was set at four years, and in reducing this to 34 months he had taken into account the defendant's old age and previous contributions to society, but also the damage he had caused.

    Hospital unveils 3D printed models to aid surgeons

<img alt="Researchers like Dr Victor Chan, right, are looking at creating more models to help surgeons practise different procedures. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790058_1_20250203120239.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eastern Hospital has introduced its latest 3D printed model of newborn babies' lungs to help doctors practise surgical intervention to treat pneumothorax, a condition when air accumulates in the pleural cavity which can collapse the lung and cause problems with heartbeat and breathing, in some cases becoming fatal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The hospital says it has been working on these models using artificial intelligence along with the data of real patients including those from Computed Tomography (CT) scans.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make the models' texture more similar to real human skin and tissue, the research team also used data from pigs and chickens to help build the models.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital hopes the new 3D models will help doctors treat pneumothorax cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Surgical intervention needs to be done promptly and swiftly especially for newborn babies whose conditions may deteriorate quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consultant for Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Dr Victor Chan explained that since the condition requires swift intervention, doctors need to be familiar with the procedure and have ample practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very complicated procedure, we need to follow the steps very meticulously, we can't risk the patient because of some inexperience or wrong steps. Therefore we need very good training on the doctors before we allow them to perform the procedure on a real patient," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the condition is not common, it can be hard for doctors to get hands-on experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that's why a simulation training, particularly on a nicely and beautifully made model, would be important," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hongkonger held prisoner and forced to work at a scam farm in Myanmar has been rescued and is back across the border in Thailand, SAR officials have confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's The Nation newspaper reported that the woman, 31, was freed on Sunday after the Thai police and army reached out to commanders of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army which controls an area south of Myawaddy in Myanmar where the woman was being detained by a "Chinese call-centre gang".
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent weeks, ransoms have been paid to secure the release of other Hongkongers being held captive in the region, but sources told RTHK that this was not the case this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Hong Kong's Security Bureau said a task force it set up in response to the detentions will "arrange for the individual's return to Hong Kong as soon as possible".
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the task force will "continue to actively assist and follow up on all relevant request-for-assistance cases of Hong Kong residents who have yet to return".
  <br>
  <br>
  Several SAR residents are still believed to be being held prisoner by criminal gangs in Southeast Asia.

    Over cleaning could trigger eczema in children: CUHK

<img alt="Researchers from Chinese University's medical school have found that pandemic babies had a higher risk of developing atopic diseases such as eczema. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790031_1_20250203091514.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) have found that children born during the pandemic are more likely to have atopic diseases like eczema, and over-sanitisation was one of the reasons for this.
 <br>
  <br>
  They analysed data from 1,152 children born in Hong Kong, including 155 children born before the pandemic and 997 pandemic babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  They observed that there was a 46 percent increase in the incidence of allergy for pandemic babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The research team said excessive cleaning could hinder babies in their ability to develop healthy gut bacteria, which is crucial for children in building a strong immune system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gut dysbiosis would increase the chance of children of getting skin diseases like eczama.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the researchers, Professor Siew Ng, said lacking resistance genes, children may not have the immunity to combat different types of bacteria or bugs in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is becoming more and more common after the Covid-19 pandemic. We found there’s a 46 percent increase. I think part of the reason is because we are basically disinfecting too much. The hygiene measures are basically too stringent,” Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the tips we would give parents is to reduce or maybe to alleviate some of these atopic diseases is -- I think number one, is that it's important to be hygienic, but I think we shouldn't be over aggressive in our behaviour,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK says it has also developed two new oral probiotics, named SIM03 and SIM05, for children and adults with eczema respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their pilot studies found that after taking these probiotics for three months, their eczema symptoms were relieved and their sleep quality improved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked when the probiotics would be available for sale, Ng said the university would like to do a larger study on the use of the two probiotics in different population groups first.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge saw a surge in travellers over Lunar New Year, officials say, with the number passing through the Zhuhai port hitting a record high on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Border inspection authorities said 156,000 inbound and outbound passenger trips were made through that port on the third day of the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the highest number since the facility opened in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday to Friday, more than 454,000 passenger trips were recorded through the port, marking a 22 percent increase when compared with the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department warned that it expected a large number of vehicles to use the bridge between Sunday evening and the early hours of Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Zhuhai said people were having to wait more than 40 minutes for inspections on Sunday afternoon.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said he expects Hong Kong interest rates will remain high for some time because of the tariffs the US has imposed on China, Canada and Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  An executive order from US President Donald Trump on Saturday introduced an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports, with a rate of 25 percent for the other two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the tariffs will hurt Americans more than anyone else because the extra costs incurred will be passed on to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the resulting inflationary pressures in the US will also affect Hong Kong, he warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If their inflation stays high, that should also affect us. Because after all, with the dollar peg, when US interest rates are high, rates in Hong Kong should also be high," Chan said on Commercial Radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This adds to the burden of business and affects the business environment and to a degree adds constraints to asset markets. These are things that we have to fully consider."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR government has made plans to deal with potential Trump policies, describing the president's governance style as "rather extreme at times".

    'Subsidies for the elderly must be retained'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Community activists are urging Financial Secretary Paul Chan to ring-fence spending on support for elderly people and look elsewhere as he seeks to balance the books.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) invited lawmakers Andrew Lam, Lam Chun-sing, David Lam and Tik Chi-yuen to a sharing session on Sunday to hear public concerns about living expenses, including worries about possible changes to a scheme that allows the over 60s to use public transport for just HK$2 per trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Hau, aged 64, said he hopes the government won't bump the minimum age for the subsidised fares back up to 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I work as a security guard. Sometimes I have to go all the way to Tuen Mun from Sham Shui Po for work. Scrapping the HK$2 subsidy would add to my burden,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m working hard, but I would be getting less assistance from the government. Is the government trying to encourage people not to work?”
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Tik said the travel subsidy has boosted elderly people's social mobility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more elderly people going out to work, they are volunteering in the community. This can improve their health in general, which is creating value for society. With better health, the elderly will not need to rely on the public medical system, or other social assistance that much," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo said while it understands the government needs to cut back on spending to address a budget deficit, it is important that a range of subsidies are protected, including the carer allowance and community healthcare schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other elderly people invited to the sharing session spoke of the financial difficulties they face, even with the subsidies provided by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I skip my meals to save up money. I haven’t eaten once in the past two days," said a woman surnamed Chin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile a woman in her seventies told the lawmakers that she struggled to look after her health while also caring for her husband who is bedbound.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ve been suffering from body aches [from taking care of my husband]. It's also hard for us to get to the doctor as taxis often do not want to take customers in a wheelchair. My doctor told me to get an MRI scan, but I don’t have money for that,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman said she is not eligible for a carer allowance of up to HK$3,000 because she gets Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and the Old Age Living Allowance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Lam Chun-sing said the government should consider relaxing the eligibility requirements for the carer allowance so people in the woman's situation can receive a portion of the subsidy.

 How noisy 50,000 excited football fans can get will be put to the test this week as the roof of the main stadium is retracted for the first time in a series of trial runs at the new Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say the stadium will be packed on Tuesday for a Hong Kong Premier League U22 match between Kitchee and North District.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing on Sunday, sports commissioner George Tsoi said opening the roof will allow the Environmental Protection Department to check how much of a noise nuisance events at the stadium could potentially pose to residents of nearby areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that officials also want to see how opening the roof affects the experience of those inside the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last time when we had a sports event in early January, we found that the overall ambience, when the retractable roof was closed, was very good. Because when the audience were cheering for their teams, the sound effects were very good," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we are going to open the retractable roof to see how the ambience, as well as other production effects, would be going on in sports events."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said they also want to see how easy it is for 50,000 people to leave the stadium after an event, with services on the MTR's Tuen Ma and Kwun Tong lines to be enhanced and 10 special bus services to be laid on for the test event.

    Public agree changes needed over HK$2 fares: Paul Chan

<div class="itemFullText">
 There is broad public agreement that changes have to be made to Hong Kong's HK$2 transport fares for the over 60s, Paul Chan said on Sunday, as he suggested healthcare and education could also be in line for government spending cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  On a Commercial Radio programme, the financial secretary said the intentions behind the HK$2 scheme were very good, but the expenses involved have been mounting since the eligible age was lowered from the original 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there's a public consensus that the current scheme isn't financially sustainable over the long run, if no changes are made to it. So how should we change it?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are so many different views. We're collecting them and then officials will assess them and discuss them internally. We're all looking at different proposals in detail."
  <br>
  <br>
  With his budget speech coming up on February 26, Chan said there is room to save money in areas including education and healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said universities have relatively large amounts of reserves, adding that everyone can play their part in the next couple of years to tackle the government's budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said, however, that the government will minimise the effects of expenditure cuts on the public.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong is in for an exciting year filled with major events.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on social media after attending the Lunar New Year Cup football match at Hong Kong Stadium on Saturday night, Chan praised both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the Hong Kong Legends and World Legends teams had delivered entertaining games, featuring impressive goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match was drawn 3-3 at full time, but the World Legends won a penalty shoot-out 6-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  He praised the lively atmosphere at the stadium, where around 20,000 fans turned up for the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the game - featuring top international players and local soccer stars - was the perfect way for local and visiting soccer fans to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday.

    Unjabbed 19-month-old boy in intensive care with flu

<img alt="The Centre for Health Protection is calling on parents to make sure their kids get vaccinated. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789926_1_20250201204812.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection on Saturday said a 19-month-old boy is in critical condition after being infected with influenza A. He was clinically diagnosed with influenza A complicated by severe pneumonia and is still hospitalised.
 <br>
  <br>
  He has not received the seasonal influenza vaccine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the flu season began in Hong Kong last month, a total of nine cases of severe influenza virus infections in children have been reported. Seven of the children had not been vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities say they expect influenza activity to increase further, and the activity of other respiratory infectious diseases may also increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection said that in this latest case, the boy had been in good health before, but has had a fever and cough since Thursday. He was taken to the Baptist Hospital for treatment yesterday and subsequently transferred to Kwong Wah Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is currently still in the paediatric intensive care unit. The boy did not travel abroad during the incubation period and his home contacts have no symptoms at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre said that as of January 26, the seasonal influenza vaccination rate for children aged six months to under two years old was still low, at about 20.9 percent. Although it has increased slightly compared to the same period last year, it is still lower than the vaccination rate of children in other age groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre again called on people who have not yet received the seasonal flu jab to take immediate action, to reduce the risk of severe illness and death. The CHP also reiterated its call for all parents to make sure their children have been vaccinated.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said it is inappropriate to simply look at projected unit completion as the total supply volume for private flats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the government announced that some 107,000 private units may be available for sale in the coming three to four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her Facebook page, Ho said she is aware of online discussions about the number being overly optimistic and that there might not be that many flats available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho explained that the figure includes completed units that are still unsold, units currently being built, and those whose construction hasn't started yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing minister stressed that the administration has been consistent in how they release data, and such information can be traced back for more than a decade to avoid confusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also noted that nearly 19,000 private flats had been completed each year over the past five years, saying this shows the government’s success in balancing demand and supply.

    Sports dispute resolution scheme to start this year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung revealed on Saturday that the pilot scheme for sports dispute resolution will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The idea was first unveiled in the Policy Address last year with the aim of promoting sports arbitration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung told a television programme that the scheme will run for two to three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  While it is not mandatory for subvented sports associations to participate in the test run, he said they are highly encouraged to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he believes sports groups can improve their governance by joining the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can show the public that when they have internal issues that cannot be resolved, they are willing to solve them through a fair and open system which has good value for money," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not expensive and won't take much time. And it won't hinder the development of elite athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung noted that athletes participating in the Olympics have limited time and have to undergo intensive training.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the matter is dealt with in court, the athletes will lose the chance to participate in the competition due to ongoing legal procedures, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deputy justice chief pointed out that the arbitration rules will be set up by the middle of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will look for a suitable arbitration body in the coming months, which has to be experienced and have close contact with the sports industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will subsidise part of the cost of arbitration during the test run, he added.

    University fees rise won't hurt competitiveness: Choi

<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi said on Saturday that a rise in school fees will not hurt the competitiveness of the SAR’s universities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting the next academic year, the government will hike the current tuition fees of HK$42,100 for eight public universities by just under 18 percent in phased increases over three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fees have been frozen for almost three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi told an RTHK radio programme that she believes the move will not affect the universities’ teaching, research and attractiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For most of the time, apart from relying on government funding as their source of income, the institutions have also had donations. And besides undergraduate programmes, they've taught postgraduate programmes which consist of more self-financing students,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Universities have different sources of income. Of course, funding will have some impact on them. But we note that they also have relatively sound reserves or financial management.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the institutions will have sufficient time to make arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi also revealed that the government has no plan to gradually increase the tuition fees of non-local students until it's recovered all costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that Singapore is charging non-local students between HK$100,000 and HK$200,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said that if the SAR hiked fees to more than HK$300,000, local universities will not be able to attract top talent.

 Preliminary figures for the Lunar New Year point to a rebound in tourist numbers, including overseas visitors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board said on Saturday that Hong Kong attracted close to 680,000 tourists from Tuesday to Friday, a 6 percent year-on-year increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board's executive director Dane Cheng told a Commercial Radio programme that the percentage increase for overseas visitors was even better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From Lunar New Year Eve to Thursday, there was a 12 percent year-on-year increase. People might feel that the vibe is better because most of them congregated in the tourist hot spots,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hiked to the Peak with my family [on Friday], and it was super crowded. There were people in every mall and restaurant, and the Peak tram station was packed with people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  There were more than 560,000 mainland visitors in the first four days of their eight-day Golden Week holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said he expects more mainlanders to visit Hong Kong in the coming days, noting many of them might have been spending time with their families earlier in the holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that about half of the inbound tourists stayed overnight, and most hotels were nearly fully booked

 Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Saturday that things went smoothly at the border crossings during the Lunar New Year holiday, despite changes from last year's travel arrangements.
 <br>
  <br>
  Unlike last year, border checkpoints at Lo Wu and Shenzhen Bay didn't extend their hours, leaving Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Port to operate around-the-clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told a Commercial Radio programme that officials had acted to ensure smooth travel arrangements for tourists heading back to the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Even though we didn't operate some border points right through the night, we were concerned that some people might think Lo Wu was still open after midnight, and take the train. So we made announcements on the trains to keep them informed, and in Sheung Shui, we arranged an overnight shuttle bus going to the border checkpoints that did remain open all night,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said he'd heard anecdotal evidence from the hotel sector and retailers that business is going well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged Hongkongers to stay in the SAR to spend, saying they can also find cheap and good quality options here.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the government had earlier partnered with five restaurant chains - Fairwood, Cafe de Coral, Tai Hing, Maxim's, and McDonald's - to distribute food coupons to about 50,000 elderly people through 214 elderly centres across Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each of them will receive five coupons, allowing them to buy designated meals at a discounted price of HK$25.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the feedback has been positive so far, and he hopes it will motivate more isolated seniors to leave their homes and engage with the community.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Bureau said the Travel Industry Authority is working with Miramar Travel to help relatives of a male tour guide who died in a traffic accident in Shanghai on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The coach was taking a 16-member tour group to Shanghai Pudong International Airport when the accident occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miramar general manager Alex Lee said the travel agency would not speculate on the cause of the incident, which is under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've already contacted his family. Only one of them was in a position to go to Shanghai, but their mainland travel permit had expired," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Immigration Department is helping us to find a way to help the family member. Our company will also send a staffer to travel to Shanghai with his family."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said all members of the six-day tour group have now returned to the SAR, including two who felt unwell and had undergone medical tests in a hospital in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that as far as he knew, no one had been arrested in relation to the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said it's reached out to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai, as well as the Travel Industry Authority, and would follow up on the case.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The racecourse has rolled out the red carpet for tens of thousands of people on Friday for the Chinese New Year Raceday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 86 thousand revellers came to Sha Tin Racecourse, according to the Jockey Club, including record high numbers of tourists from the mainland and overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law, was in attendance and said she was delighted to see such a high turnout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the crowd was an Italian tourist, who told an RTHK reporter that he's thrilled to experience the unique horse racing culture in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's amazing. Lots of lights, sounds, crowds everywhere. It's similar but quite different because it's not so famous and popular in Italy. [Only] a few people follow horse racing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another tourist from Canada said he enjoyed the festive atmosphere, including special Chinese New Year features and installations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a Jockey simulator. That's one that I really wanted to do. We took pictures with the guy who's giving out candies. It's a very nice event and there's a lot of different things for Chinese New Year that make it truly special," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Law also told reporters that 216,000 travellers set foot in the SAR on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A majority of them, or more than 187,000 were visitors from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  This Lunar New Year marks the first since the government resumed the three percent hotel accommodation tax on January 1, after it had been suspended since July, 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourism minister said the tax is here to stay, as people have adapted to the measure before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've charged the three percent hotel accommodation tax before. As long as visitors have fun in Hong Kong, and think that it's good value for money, the three percent tax won't have too much of an impact on them."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that with many hotels reaching an occupancy rate of 100 percent these days, it showed that visitors were attracted by Hong Kong's festive spirit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan was also at the Sha Tin racecourse to officiate the opening ceremony with Law.

    'Rise in investment scams, impersonation of officials'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The police commissioner on Friday warned the public to be on guard, amid a rise in investment scams in recent months, with most cases involving cryptocurrency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Siu revealed that the frauds usually begin with fake romances - scammers would show concern for their target before providing them with a link.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised the cases were too good to be true, and the public should never fall for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief also said there had been a surge in cases in which scammers pretended to be mainland officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whenever the caller claims to be an official from the mainland, and says he - or she - is investigating a case etc, you can actually hang up immediately," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if they don't ask for money, you can hang up right away. These must be scams."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the force is working to roll out more measures to combat scams targetting students from the mainland, and hopes to intercept the cases at sources.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Worshippers on Friday flocked to Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin to pray for good fortune and prosperity in the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to Chinese traditions, people tend to avoid visiting family and friends on the third day of the Lunar New Year when quarrels are believed to be more likely.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police implemented crowd control measures as devotees queued to offer prayers and buy pinwheels, a traditional blessing item at the temple.
  <br>
  <br>
  One worshipper told RTHK that she's there to pray for good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The crowd seems smaller compared to last year, probably because many people are travelling abroad or up north," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pinwheel vendor who usually prices the items at HK$68 said sales are down by 60 to 70 percent compared to previous years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was upbeat about the SAR's economic prospects, comparing the city to a phoenix.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope Hong Kong will thrive and return to its former glory. After all, Hong Kong is a phoenix that never dies. It's normal to have ups and downs," he said.

    HK sees a smaller rise in outbound tours over LNY
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789786_1_20250131105710.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Association said on Friday that even though the city saw a rise in outbound tour groups over the Lunar New Year holiday, it was smaller than the increase in 2024 when the city celebrated the festival for the first time since the lifting of Covid restrictions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, executive director Timothy Chui said many of the tours were destined for Japan and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a flight was scheduled to Japan every 15 minutes, joking that it was even more frequent than buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui said there were two factors leading to the change in the increment of tour groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[First] this Lunar New Year holiday and the Christmas holiday are just separated by about 20 days, which is very close," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Second, last year there was [so-called] 'revenge spending'. Customers signed up for tours. They didn't ask about prices, they just wanted to know if tours were available and how many vacancies there were. But this year, they've been comparing packages on offer - and prices."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said tour prices were similar to last year, except for those heading to the Greater Bay Area that cost slightly more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui revealed while usually only around 500 tours were bound for the mainland on the weekend, a daily 600 to 800 tour groups had set off for the mainland in the past few days.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for incoming tour groups, he said those staying overnight accounted for 50 percent of the total number of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui said the number of mainlanders entering the SAR through the Shenzhen Bay port on Lunar New Year's Eve had surged by about 43 percent year-on-year. He said the increase was mainly due to the resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that hotels were almost 100 percent full between Lunar New Year's Eve and Saturday, and the figure will only start to come down next Monday and Tuesday.

    'More non-local race broadcasts to boost economy'

<img alt="The Jockey club wants to increase the maximum number of simulcast races and days per season to boost revenue. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789787_1_20250131105717.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Friday said the Jockey Club's plan to broadcast more non-local horse racing events will boost Hong Kong's tourism and betting revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  The club wants to increase the maximum number of simulcast races per season from 25 to 55, and the maximum number of simulcast days per season from 37 to 70 in 2026/27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo Wai-kwok, who chairs the Business and Professionals Alliance, said local racing fans' appetite for international events is on the rise, and the change would benefit society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will increase investment and the Jockey Club's revenue. This benefits Hong Kong because the Jockey Club is actually a very successful social enterprise," Lo told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of its earnings flow back into society, not just through betting taxes paid to the Hong Kong government, but also through substantial investments in social welfare such as schools, hospitals and care homes."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker said the initiative is also expected to boost tourism, noting that the New Year's Day race saw mainland visitor numbers double to 4,120 compared to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apollo Ng, chairman of the Hong Kong Thoroughbred Breeders' Alliance, told the same programme that there aren't enough overseas race broadcasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said the proposal will help keep local fans engaged - especially during the racing off-season from mid-July to early September, when some fans may travel elsewhere to gamble.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public have until February 21 to submit their views on the proposal to the Betting and Lotteries Commission.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourists and locals were treated to a spectacular Lunar New Year fireworks display over Victoria Harbour on Thursday, the second day of the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  Divided into nine named pyrotechnic scenes, the show began with "A Brand New Beginning", featuring the lucky number eight in red.
  <br>
  <br>
  It then moved on to gold ingots, symbolising prosperity and abundance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eighth scene "Double Luck and Goodness" showed six panda faces, representing the number of pandas in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show concluded with "Year of the Snake". This scene filled the sky with star-patterned pyrotechnics to the sound of Chinese gongs and drums.
  <br>
  <br>
  The display began at 8 pm and lasted 23 minutes. It was coordinated by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau.

 Thousands of people gathered around Victoria Harbour on Thursday for the New Year firework display, traditionally held on the second day of the Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  A secondary school student told RTHK she had arrived at 3.30 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to enjoy the festive atmosphere, and get a good spot. This is the first time I have come to see the fireworks. I think the weather is quite good today. I decided to go out and see how much better watching the fireworks is, compared to seeing them on television," she said, adding that she brought a book and some food to kill time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man said he is looking forward to seeing the panda patterns, which appear in one of the scenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came at around one, and I think it's worth it. I brought a tripod and a camera to take photos. I think fireworks are so beautiful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Shenzhen said he had come to Hong Kong just for the display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think having more than 20,000 fireworks will be magnificent, and the themes are also very meaningful. I was busy seeing my relatives on the first day of the Lunar New Year, so I missed the fireworks in Guangzhou. I can also appreciate the view of Victoria Harbour, while seeing the fireworks here," the man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police closed off a number of roads on both sides of the harbour ahead of the display.

    Lunar New Year restaurant reservations up 10 percent

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering representative said on Thursday that reservations at Chinese restaurants over Lunar New Year were up ten percent from last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management chairman, Leung Chun-wah, said despite a number of Hong Kong residents travelling during the holidays, those who stayed in the city were willing to spend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lunar New Year is the happiest festival for Chinese people. The number of people flying out was not too many, somewhere between 300,000 to 400,000 people. People still have to eat their meals, and they want to be happy while doing so. So, our business and reservation numbers both saw a ten percent increase," he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 357,927 Hong Kong residents departed the city on Wednesday, according to Immigration Department figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Leung said restaurants generally saw just one round of customers early in the evening, as people's eating habits had changed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People eat early and leave early. We don't really see a second round of customers - those who go to restaurants at 8:30 pm for dinner," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also noted that customers were spending less than before the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the average spending per person was between HK$350 to HK$400 - similar to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the resumption of the multi-entry visa for Shenzhen residents only benefited restaurants in tourist spots, which recorded an around 20 percent increase in business.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Thursday said there's a chance that interest rates in the city will remain at "relatively high levels" for a while, after the US central bank kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve had left key overnight interest rates steady in the 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent target range, with its chair Jerome Powell saying there would be no rush to cut them again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's de-facto central bank said in response that the policy decision was "in line with market expectations".
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, the pace of future rate cuts remains uncertain as it is dependent on US inflation and labour market data developments, the effect of previous rate cuts, as well as the impact of fiscal, economic and trade policies adopted by the new administration on economic activity," the authority said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates in Hong Kong might still remain at relatively high levels for some time, and the extent and pace of future US interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public should exercise caution when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added it would continue to closely monitor market developments and maintain monetary and financial stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It stressed that the city's financial and monetary markets have continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Market liquidity condition has remained stable, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate stays steady," the authority said.

    Fortune urges practical measures, says rural chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rural leader has urged officials to come up with policies that are practical rather than window dressing in the upcoming budget, after drawing a fortune stick for Hong Kong in an annual Lunar New Year ritual.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday morning, Heung Yee Kuk chairman Kenneth Lau picked a No 24 "neutral" stick at the Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stick corresponds to a prophecy that roughly translates to: "Live a life without wrongdoing, it is only greed that stirs up trouble; with the help of noble people, don't waste your efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Interpreting the message, Lau said it means doing the right thing and that Hong Kong needs the support of the country. He also appealed to Financial Secretary Paul Chan to roll out practical economic measures in his budget, which will be unveiled on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the financial secretary will particularly take care of the middle class and the underprivileged, and not increase fees or taxes," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When putting in resources, officials should not do things that are just window dressing, they should be practical... Under this global economic situation and high interest rate environment, the government has to promote the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Each year, the head of the rural body goes to the Che Kung Temple on the second day of the Lunar New Year to draw a fortune stick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau initially thought he drew the number 20 stick, but later said he had made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the chairman of the Sha Tin Rural Committee drew an ill-omened No 82 stick for the Sha Tin community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 96 sticks in the cup, 35 are “positive” sticks, 17 are “negative” ones, while 44 are "neutral".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lunar New Year parade took place in Tsim Sha Tsui on Wednesday, with Chief Executive John Lee opening the event.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, the Chief Executive told the crowd that there was no better place to ring in the Chinese New Year than Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only in Hong Kong, the world's East-meets-West centre for cultural exchange and day-and-night entertainment, all around town you'll be greeted by the magnificent spectacle of our festivities and the warm hospitality of the people of Hong Kong, as we share the joy of the year with all of you. I wish you all a happy, healthy, and eventful Year of the Snake."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said this year's parade, themed "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", featured 55 performing groups and floats, which showcased Hong Kong, as well as 14 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are "here in the world city of Hong Kong to dance, sing and perform, skip, juggle, cheerlead and otherwise amaze and delight you in this most auspicious of days," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The night parade started at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza at 8 pm, then headed down Canton Road, Haiphong Road, and Nathan Road, before ending at the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, organiser Hong Kong Tourism Board said it expected around 100,000 people to turn up for the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the Spring Festival celebrations, Lee added that the floats and some of Wednesday night's performances will move to Lam Tsuen for Thursday's Hong Kong Well-wishing Festival. The floats will be on display there until February 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other festivities include a 23-minute firework show on both sides of Victoria Harbour on the second day of the Lunar New Year, as well as horse racing at Sha Tin on the third day.

 Crowds gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui on Wednesday for the Lunar New Year parade .
 <br>
  <br>
  Themed "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", it features nine floats showcasing unique elements from the SAR, alongside 46 performing groups from around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will start at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza, then head down Canton Road, Haiphong Road, and Nathan Road, before ending at the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Road closures and traffic diversions have been put in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Leung said she came to support her daughter, who will be performing in the parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My daughter will be dancing, so I must show my support. I have been here since around 3 pm, after sending her to the assembly venue. I am very excited about seeing her, and it is also my first time to see the parade in person," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist surnamed Jia from Northeast China said she had come to Hong Kong for the festive atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think Hong Kong has a very strong Lunar New Year vibe and I love the culture around the Greater Bay Area. I know there will be a parade tonight and fireworks tomorrow, and I booked my hotel last November," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Shenzhen tourist surnamed Huang said this is her second time at the parade..
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, I did not pick a good spot. So this year, I learned from my past experience and arrived at 2.30 pm. The location I am in is the performance area, so the lighting will be nicer," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang said she found the float designs delicate and the performing groups from around the world very attractive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board expects around 100,000 people to turn up for the event.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority’s acting chief executive Vivian Cheung on Wednesday said she expected passenger numbers to be about 30 percent higher this Lunar New Year holiday, when compared to last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  She said the airport had been operating smoothly and around 160,000 people had passed through on the first day of the Year of the Snake. That's about 20 percent fewer than on the peak days earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The last few days were a peak period and the airport saw around 200,000 people a day, which almost reached the level before the pandemic,” Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, we have around 75 pairs of flights between Hong Kong and 13 Japanese cities every day, meaning there’s a flight every 15 minutes. It’s very convenient for Hongkongers to travel,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also expected flight movements this year to return to the pre-pandemic level, with the airport seeing around 1,100 flights taking off and landing each day.

    Lam Tsuen Wishing Tree draws New Year crowds

 People headed to the Lam Tsuen Wishing Tree in Taipo on Wednesday, a traditional event on the first day of Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  It's believed that throwing a placard with one's wishes, and a mandarin, onto the tree will make the wish come true.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wished everyone good fortune, good health and for wishes to come true. And for a better year. Everyone went through Covid over the past few years, I hope everyone's luck will improve every year. My grandson successfully threw the placard onto the tree on his first try. It's the first time, we got so lucky," said a man surnamed Pang, who arrived at around 9 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  A boy surnamed Pang said it took him four times to make his wish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I threw the placard a few times before it landed on the tree. It's so difficult. The wind affects where it lands, and it falls off. I had to jump to make sure it hung on the tree," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wished for better exam results because my scores are bad. I hope I get better grades in Maths, English and Chinese. I also wished to go to Japan because the place has a lot of food and things that I like," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sophie, who's originally from England, said she came early to avoid the crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We thought it was going to be very busy. We made a wish on the tree, and we put a wish in the lotus pond as well. On my card, I said I wanted a year of adventure and fun. I've only lived in Hong Kong for four months, and I have lots to learn about this beautiful city," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law was also at the venue. She wished for Hong Kong athletes to achieve good results in all competitions.

  Speaking to the press, she said she hoped tourists would enjoy a happy Lunar New Year in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a float parade tonight, fireworks for tomorrow, horse racing on the third day, and the Lunar New Year Cup on the fourth day. There's also a lot of activities at temples, and today is also a great day for hiking. I believe everyone will spend a happy Spring Festival in Hong Kong," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the Lam Tsuen Well-wishing Bazaar has been scaled up, with a Tai Po district council member saying it will boost the festive atmosphere and local economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, introduced last year, starts on Wednesday and runs until February 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK programme, Lo Hiu-fung said he expected an increase in footfall of at least 10 percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw a lot of nearby residents and tourists coming to the bazaar at night, last year. So this year, we decided to host the event again, and we made it bigger. The number of food stalls have doubled to more than 20," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the event would again feature floats this year.

 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the space oil drug problem in Hong Kong has got worse at a rapid rate over the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is planning to list etomidate, a main component of the substance, as a dangerous drug on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Tang said the number of cases related to space oil increased drastically last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Actually the situation has worsened rapidly over the past year. The number of cases in 2024 was seven times more than in 2023, and the number of those arrested increased 11 fold. The amount of space oil drug seized also increased at least four times," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see how serious the problem is and therefore, we need to handle it through legislation,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the government will boost education related to the substance on social media and schools, and also equip teachers to help identify students who use the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Tang also spoke about the proposed legislation on protection of critical infrastructures. He said the legislation is to ensure the operations of key facilities such as water and electricity, if they come under cyber-attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said large corporations will have the responsibility to protect their computer systems, and to report to the government if they face cyber-attacks, as well as having a contingency plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said individuals and small businesses will not be affected by the proposed law.
