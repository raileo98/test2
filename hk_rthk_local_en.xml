<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it has submitted requests to extend the service hours at two border checkpoints on New Year’s Eve, and are awaiting approval from the mainland authorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The requests include overnight service at the Shenzhen Bay port and extended hours at the Lo Wu checkpoint until 2am from the current 12am.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and Huanggang checkpoints will operate round the clock as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government’s inter-departmental working group on festival arrangements held a meeting on Thursday ahead of the upcoming festive period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who chairs the group, said he expects a significant influx of visitors during New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said SAR officials will do all they can to facilitate tourist flow and ensure smooth operations at the various border checkpoints.

 Cathay Group announced on Thursday that additional flights and destinations will be introduced in the upcoming year, as part of its two-year rebuilding plan.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FTU lawmaker Bill Tang on Thursday said he hopes students here can learn more about the Nanjing Massacre, so that they will cherish peace and contribute to the country’s development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The legislator paid a visit to United Christian College in Kwun Tong and spoke to around 900 students a day ahead of the 87th anniversary of the historical event.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Japanese troops captured the city of Nanjing on December 13, 1937, they killed more than 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers in one of the most barbaric episodes of the Second World War.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK after the sharing session, Tang said the prerequisite to patriotism is a strong understanding of the country, including its history, culture, societal development, as well as economic and technological advances.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The more you learn, the more love you will feel for the country. Regardless of whether the country is thriving or facing challenges, we will always be proud of being a Chinese,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang added that he hopes students can understand why China places a strong emphasis on development and strives to “stand strong”, in face of the painful past.
  <br>
  <br>
  A form five student said she’s gained a deeper understanding of what the Chinese people had experienced in the past, while another said he’s come to appreciate the importance of peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Chinese History teacher at the school, meanwhile, said the sharing session has helped students better understand the country’s past and strengthened their national identity.

    Plaza Hollywood cinema likely to close on Friday

<img alt="Many people said they have fond memories of the cinema in Plaza Hollywood. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783222_1_20241212190641.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A cinema in Diamond Hill will likely cease operations on Friday, potentially becoming the seventh movie theatre to close this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Even though the MCL branch at Plaza Hollywood hasn’t made an official announcement yet, the cinema has suspended ticket-selling on its website and its ticket counters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spanning 38,000 square feet, the cinema has six halls with a total capacity of almost 1,600 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  While staff members at the cinema refused to comment on the reported closure, they conceded that "operation of the cinema will temporarily pause from Friday".
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those paying a potential last visit to MCL Cinemas PLUS+ Plaza Hollywood was Shaun, a university student.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe because of people heading north or the internet is growing fast, not many people are coming to the cinemas. But I love watching movies inside cinemas, that's why I'm quite distressed," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diana, who’s lived in the housing complex above the mall for over two decades, said the cinema means a lot to her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just get in the lift and come here within ten minutes. It's very convenient ...it's very causal and easy,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, during my childhood, my parents often brought me to watch movies during the weekends and so this is a habit.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another nearby resident, 76-year-old Raymond, said he’s been a big fan of the cinema.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's such a pity. There's only this cinema in the area. I am an elderly and this cinema offers discounts for senior citizens until 1:30pm. I once watched five movies in a week," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least six cinemas have closed this year, including the almost six-decade old President Theatre in Causeway Bay.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting and six other defendants were on Thursday convicted of rioting in Yuen Long during the 2019 protests.
 <br>
  <br>
  They were found guilty for their roles in clashes inside the Yuen Long MTR station on July 21 that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his verdict, District Court judge Stanley Chan said the former Democratic Party lawmaker had "fanned the flames" by going to the station and asking his assistant to livestream the events there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecution had said that the defendant was using his capacity as a legislator to lead a group of protesters to provoke a rival group dressed in white.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam, 47, had pleaded not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been serving a separate sentence of six years and nine months for subversion, for his role in an unsanctioned Legco primary.

    Surge in cases involving impersonation of officials

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday reported a surge in cases involving the impersonation of officials, with nearly 900 scams reported in the initial 10 months of this year, marking a 12 percent increase from the previous period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they received 874 cases that amounted to HK$1.42 billion, more than double from previous figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Theodora Lee, the superintendent at the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre of the Commercial Crime Bureau, said that 30 percent of victims were university students, adding that scammers have adopted novel tactics to deceive people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scammers are getting more aggressive. In recent cases, we have seen scammers demanding students to take nude photos or videos and hide in remote areas. In one case, they even requested a victim leave Hong Kong for Thailand and cut off contact with their families," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tactics were aimed at pressuring the students' parents for more money."
  <br>
  <br>
  One victim who is a master's student in the SAR said she travelled to the mainland, and handed over 500,000 yuan in cash to the scammers, after she was informed by scammers dressed in police uniforms with identification that she was involved in a money laundering case.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was then directed to Thailand, where she was told she was prohibited from contacting anyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the scammers later falsely informed her parents that she had been kidnapped and demanded a 10 million yuan ransom.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her parents reported the incident, and she was eventually found in a Bangkok hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall there were 36,405 cases of fraud from January to October this year, involving a sum of over HK$7 billion.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has urged Hong Kong business representatives in Beijing to take a leading role in facilitating exchanges between the SAR and the capital city.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a closed-door luncheon on Thursday during Lee's duty visit, the CE met members of the Beijing-based Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce in China and other business figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the chamber has all along committed to promoting exchanges in areas such as trade, culture and technology, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very pleased that the chamber has played a leading role in facilitating the complementary advantages and the sharing of benefits in resources between Beijing and Hong Kong,” Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope that we will continue to strengthen cooperation and facilitate exchanges between the two places.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairwoman of the chamber, Judith Yu, said the chief executive called on those attending the luncheon to assist firms in both cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[He mentioned] we should act as a platform to help Hong Kong companies based in Beijing to adapt to the environment, and also we should help more [SAR] companies and Beijing companies use the platform of Hong Kong to list in Hong Kong, and through Hong Kong invest overseas.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Those at the meeting told Lee to consider introducing more measures, including tax concessions, to attract high-performing mainland individuals from the technology sector to come to the SAR, Yu added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee separately met leaders from universities in Beijing that are included in the list of eligible institutions under the SAR's top talent pass scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The representatives came from Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beihang University and Beijing Institute of Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanking the universities for their continued support for the SAR, Lee said he looked forward to strengthening cooperation with the institutions and working together “to build a hub for high-calibre talent”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who has been acting in Lee’s capacity during the annual visit, will travel to Beijing “at dusk” on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan will join Lee “in meeting with relevant ministries” before returning on Saturday, the government announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE is currently on a four-day duty visit to the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, Lee is scheduled to meet central government leaders on Friday to brief them on the city’s latest economic, social and political situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also return to the SAR on Saturday.

    'HK exports to see 4 percent growth in 2025'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s exports will grow by four percent in the next year, according to a forecast by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The council on Thursday said with US president-elect Donald Trump taking office next month, global trading conditions may change drastically and Hong Kong will also be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the US has announced is not just tariffs on the Hong Kong or mainland-origin goods, but more towards its major trading partners. That would be potentially a significant negative impact on global trade," HKTDC's director of research Irina Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said some exporters arranged front-loading of shipments recently due to the uncertainties, so exports in the first half of 2025 are expected to be stronger than in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It could be like... you have a quite booming first half, but into the second half, given we have front-loading behaviour already starting this quarter, we could have a very sluggish fourth quarter," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTDC said Hong Kong's exports grew by about 10 percent in the first 10 months of this year, and a strong recovery of electronics exports largely attributed to the growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said electronics had a more than 70 percent share of the city's merchandise exports, marking a 13 percent increase year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said electronics will continue to play an important role in the SAR's exports next year, given the consistent demand for AI-enabled systems.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has proposed that employees who lose their jobs after their companies go bankrupt can get as much as HK$200,000 of severance pay - double the current ceiling.
 <br>
  <br>
  They will also get half of any more money owed to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ex-gratia payments, that are made by the government's Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund (PWIF), also cover unpaid wages, pay for untaken annual leave and statutory holidays, as well as payment in lieu of notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said it expects the move to allow 86 percent of the applicants to obtain their severance payment in full.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With an average of some 3,000 applications received annually and an accumulated surplus of over HK$7.2 billion as at December 2023, PWIF was financially sound enough to cope with the possible increase in applications,” it reads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Thursday, Lam Chun-sing, chairman of the Legislative Council's manpower panel said he welcomed the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If no one abuses the fund, I think the number of applications will remain similar at around 3,000 cases each year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even when the economy is poor, I think there will be only 4,000 to 5,000 cases. To a fund that has more than HK$7 billion, it's financially sound in the long run."
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the Legco panel on manpower are set to discuss the matter on Monday.

    HKGCC predicts 2.3% GDP growth in 2025

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC) on Thursday predicted real GDP growth of 2.3 percent in 2025, along with a headline inflation rate of 2.0 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairwoman Agnes Chan said this was a cautiously optimistic prediction, and expressed confidence in central government and SAR government measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKGCC said that in a survey it carried out last month, more than 60 percent of 219 companies questioned reported increased or stable business turnover this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 18 percent said they had a positive outlook for the local economy in the next 12 months, while 45 percent held a negative view.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economist Doris Fung said that many unpredictable factors can be behind the firms' worries, such as uncertain growth rates in Europe and the potential for a trade war following Donald Trump's re-election as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we are also confident in the Hong Kong business community, they are more prepared this time with the new US government," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that about half of the companies do not plan to either hire or cut staff, and about 40 percent plan to increase salaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 60 percent of the respondents said they don't expect to change their capital investment plans over the next year, the HKGCC said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's star badminton pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet lost on Thursday at the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou.
 <br>
  <br>
  The national team's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong, gold medallists at the Paris Olympics in the summer, came from a game down to beat Tang and Tse 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China pair took the first game with ease by the score of 21-14.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was tight in the second game before Zheng and Huang finished with a 6-0 run to win 21-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both teams exchanged runs in the nail-biting decider, with Tang and Tse going on a 6-1 rally to take an 11-6 advantage into intermission.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China duo bounced back with a 4-0 run of their own, before the SAR pair took a 15-11 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zheng and Huang took control from then on, winning 21-18, to the delight of the Hangzhou crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris gold medallists are playing in their final tournament after Zheng announced his retirement from international competition last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for Tang and Tse, they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin from the national team in their final group match on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei have won both their matches, the SAR pair and Zheng and Huang are both 1-1, and the Chinese Taipei pair of Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang are 0-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs advance to the knockout stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  This could be the final tournament for the Hong Kong pair, after Tse indicated earlier she's pondering her future after battling a spate of injuries.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resources company on Thursday said the hiring intentions of local companies will be more conservative in the first quarter of next year, amid a slowdown of the global economy and geopolitical tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  ManpowerGroup said it interviewed about 500 local employers and around 35 percent thought they would increase staff numbers in the coming three months, while 28 percent said they would need to downsize.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior vice president with the group, Lancy Chui, said some sectors will face challenges, including goods and services and transport and logistics, due to a change in consumption patterns and tax-related issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said various policies and events will be favourable for some sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents will be an opportunity. Also, Hong Kong is now promoting a mega event economy. This will stimulate local and tourist consumption. It's also the peak season for festive spending, so it will boost the atmosphere for consumption," Chui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said the employment outlook for the first quarter of next year stands at +6%, marking a two percentage point drop when compared with this quarter.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has announced that Port Island will reopen on Thursday after the excavation of dinosaur fossils was completed there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 30 rocks containing dinosaur fossils have been found since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, officials announced that dinosaur fossils believed to date back to the Cretaceous period, about 145 million to 66 million years ago, were discovered on Port Island in the northeastern waters of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The excavation work was led by the Antiquities and Monuments Office with help from mainland palaeontologists and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team said all exposed fossils from the site have been removed, and they will study these fossils to figure out the dinosaur species and explore Hong Kong's palaeoecology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a spokesman from the Development Bureau reminded members of the public that "the island is remote and lacks ancillary facilities for landing and sightseeing".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to geographical and weather conditions that may pose risks for boat docking, members of the public are urged not to take risks to land on Port Island," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added there will be a temporary workshop at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre from December 20 for people to observe the preparation of fossil specimens.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The project director of Kai Tak Sports Park on Wednesday said the venue is well-positioned to showcase Hong Kong as a host city for mega events.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a ceremony announcing an exclusive partnership with HSBC, John Sharkey also unveiled plans to build the first outdoor AirBadminton court at a mall at the sports park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharkey said major facilities at the venue will be completed by the end of this year, and test events have been progressing well.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe that KTSB [Kai Tak Sports Park] will further leverage Hong Kong's advantages as a host city, providing more citizens with the opportunity to experience the resilience of our athletes first hand,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the same time, we will nurture the next generation's involvement in sports, allowing them to showcase their talents on an international stage that they can be proud to call their home.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, CEO of HSBC Hong Kong, Luanne Lim, said she thinks the partnership will elevate Hong Kong's profile as a global sports hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through this partnership, we want to support this active lifestyle by making recreational and sporting activities available to everyone, every day,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Sports unites us and brings people together, not just locally but across borders and across cultures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lim added the bank will open a new branch at the sports park to serve the local community and international visitors.

    Hard to set sexual abuse allegation time frame: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun said on Wednesday that it would be rather difficult to set a time frame as to how quickly the authorities should make public allegations of sexual abuse against residents of care homes for disabled people.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a full council meeting in the legislature, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien noted that it took officials two months to announce an alleged incident earlier this year, and said he found it unacceptable that there is no set criteria for revealing such suspected incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  In reply, Sun said the circumstances of each alleged incident are always different and if a time frame is set that is too short, this might cause the mishandling of cases, adding that if the time frame was too long, people might question why the announcement did not come sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's impossible for us to set a fixed time frame for announcements, and we have to take into consideration the unique nature of every such incident," he told lawmakers during a Q&A session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do have to take care of the emotions of the victims as well as their family members, and we will try to announce such incidents as early as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, officials amended a code of practice for care homes for the disabled, including setting out policies on installing CCTV and reviewing the footage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Connie Lam, who's a social worker by trade, pointed out that while most care homes have installed surveillance cameras, they often are too understaffed to check the footage.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Sun said there could be "riskier" periods such as when there are fewer people at the homes at weekends, and staff could review footage of those periods more regularly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said in the long run, officials hope artificial intelligence can help with such monitoring work.

 Hong Kong's superstar swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Wednesday advanced to the 100m freestyle semi-finals at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, in one of her last races before taking a break to ponder her future.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her time of 52.12 seconds topped her heat, and was good for second overall behind American Gretchen Walsh, who clocked a 51.64-second finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey, 27, was second at the first turn in the short course race and overtook Briton Freya Andersen shortly afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow SAR swimmer Li Sum-yiu, 15, was unable to advance after finishing eighth in the same heat with a time of 53.41 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals are due to begin at 0:48am on Thursday, Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey will also be looking to defend her 200m freestyle title in Hungary.

<img alt="InvestHK and Deloitte say Hong Kong can help China achieve carbon neutrality through five sectors. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783008_1_20241211160129.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has the potential to become a green technology hub, according to a study conducted by the government’s investment promotion agency and accounting firm Deloitte.
 <br>
  <br>
  They said on Wednesday that the green technology industry is worth trillions of dollars, but 41 percent of climate problems are still waiting to be addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This creates enormous business opportunities for the investors and also the tech innovators, as one way to interpret this number is that 41 percent of the problems currently do not have an available solution," said King Leung, InvestHK's Global Head of Financial Services, FinTech & Sustainability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study said the city can help China achieve carbon neutrality through five sectors, including transport, construction and waste management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohit Grover, the lead partner for sustainability and climate at Deloitte's Hong Kong branch, said the SAR can assist Chinese electric car companies with expanding their business worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For Chinese enterprises, Hong Kong will be used as one of the global hubs to globalise their operations and to raise capital through the exchange. We already see a lot of shift happening from Western brands to Chinese brands for the electric vehicles (EV) that we see on the road," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And for some of the technology innovation around various aspects of battery production or EV production, I think those start-ups are also being present in Hong Kong, which will get a bigger access to the [global] market," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For construction, Leung suggested the adoption of glass materials for insulation and generating solar power to lower energy consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "90 percent of all the electricity consumed in Hong Kong goes to buildings. We have 8,000 skyscrapers, which is the most in a single city in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that China is leading the world in green building technology patents, and Hong Kong's positioning as an international financial centre can help such companies to showcase their abilities and therefore expand to global markets through the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of waste management, Grover said a behavioural change among residents of Hong Kong will be crucial.

    'Mega events in first half drew HK$2.4bn in spending'

<img alt="Rosanna Law noted that RTHK has produced a programme providing updates on local mega events. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782995_1_20241211142635.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said that mega events in the first half of the year had attracted an estimated 550,000 visitors, who spent around HK$2.4 billion and added about HK$1.4 billion in value to the economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to the legislature, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law said there were 110 mega events in the first six months of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 70 of them were conventions and exhibitions as well as cultural, arts and creative events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker, Jeffrey Lam, asked the government how it could further enhance the attractiveness of mega-events and boost their economic benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said one of the administration's key purposes of compiling a Hong Kong mega event calendar in advance, is to allow the public and tourists to learn about them early.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[This can] foster collaboration between different industries and mega events, and facilitate the industries of tourism, hotel and catering to plan and design promotional activities and tourism products early," she wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said RTHK had produced a programme called "Mega Events Mega Hong Kong", which gives daily updates on what's happening through different media platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Information Services Department has used its website and social media platforms, such as Xiaohongshu, for promotion, while inviting media from the mainland and overseas to cover the city's mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said with HK$100 million in this year's budget earmarked for boosting mega-event promotion over the next three years, officials will review and optimise resources to enhance publicity efforts, bearing in mind ongoing developments and mega-event planning updates.

<img alt="Jordan Tang (L) and Tse Ying-suet roared to a winning start at the World Tour Finals. File photo courtesy of the Badminton Association of Hong Kong, China" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782981_1_20241211124709.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shuttlers Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet from the SAR began their final tournament of the year on a high, defeating a pair from Chinese Taipei in straight sets in the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a strong performance for the long-time Hong Kong, China mixed doubles duo from start to finish, after they made it to the year-end finals for the fourth time in their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annual showcase could very well be their last as Tse, 33, who has battled a host of injuries in recent years, said earlier she has been contemplating her future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair dispatched Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang in 39 minutes to take the first match in Group A, which has been described as a group of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and Tse set the tone early to claim the first game, 21-15.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Taipei pair put up a fight in the second match, though, drawing level at 17 before dropping the last four points and losing the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Badminton World Federation (BWF) World Tour Finals is a year-end showcase for those ranked in the top-eight in the world in eligible tournaments, with each country or region limited to sending two entries for each event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Tang and Tse are Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong from the national team on Thursday, before they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin, also from the national team, on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs in each group qualify for a spot in the knockout stage, which will take place on Saturday.

    'Passengers won't pay for transition to e-buses'

<img alt="The government says its subsidies will cover the additional costs involved as bus companies switch to electric vehicles. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782969_1_20241211114826.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said on Wednesday that he believes the additional costs incurred in Hong Kong's planned transition to electric buses will not be passed on to passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under its Green Transformation Roadmap of Public Buses and Taxis, the government plans to subsidise the purchase of 600 electric buses and 3,000 electric taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aim is for the SAR to achieve carbon neutrality, with all franchised buses and taxis to be zero emission vehicles by 2050.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Tse said the subsidy is sufficient to cover the extra costs that will be incurred by bus companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, electric double decker buses were much more expensive than regular ones, double the price of a normal bus. Regular buses cost about two million dollars, and electric ones cost four to five million dollars each. As technology advances, in recent months we have seen the price has reduced drastically. But they still cost millions of dollars each," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, the government will offer subsidies that cover the additional costs that are incurred from changing to electric buses. In that way, companies won't have to pass the additional costs incurred on to passengers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also plans to offer 500 more high-speed charging stations for taxis by the end of 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said the government will encourage petrol stations to build charging spots and offer discounts to taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Wong Yu-ting, chairman of the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, questioned whether the government will be able to achieve all these goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said he made an application to install charging spots in Tsing Yi around a year ago, but this has yet to be approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You said more charging stations will be available by the end of 2027, it's so vague. Shouldn't you talk about your goal for each year? It would be better. Or you can say by which month a certain number of charging spots will be available. In this way, it's more concrete," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Ip, vice president of the Our Hong Kong Foundation, said he welcomes the government's plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government should provide more high-speed charging spots, to benefit both the transport industry and the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip said the government should also consider promoting the use of hydrogen vehicles.
  <br>

    Private school accused of not refunding debentures

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A group of parents have accused private school Han Academy of failing to refund debentures as promised after their children left the school.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the Wong Chuk Hang institution's website, parents who enrol their children from the 2020-21 academic year must join a capital contribution scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the options is a debenture of HK$600,000. HK$45,000 is deducted every year and the remaining amount can be refunded when the student leaves the school.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received complaints from 11 parents, involving about HK$5.8 million. The force has listed the matter as a request for police investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to media enquiries, the Education Bureau said it had instructed the school to suspend its capital contribution scheme in April and establish an emergency response plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added it had received complaints from three parents so far and had urged the school to refund the money as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement added that any individual fundraising scheme by private schools has to be vetted and approved by the bureau. So far 23 schools have made such applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Secretary for Education Christine Choi pointed out the vetting mechanism was not in place when Han Academy opened in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The school was established in 2017 and back then we didn't have the vetting mechanism. Since the mechanism was set up in August 2023, we have been reviewing its additional charges," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi added the bureau has demanded the school stop collecting additional fees from parents after realising it has run into financial trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also revealed more than 100 students are currently enrolled at the academy, and the bureau will make sure it maintains its teaching quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Leung said he has received feedback from more than 50 parents who allege they haven't had their money back.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they are worried about the school's financial situation and that it might close down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The parents also have heard that the school's owner intends to wind up the school through legal means due to the ongoing unpaid rent... A couple of days ago the school also held a meeting with the parents and announced that they are in debt of HK$100 million," he told RTHK.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday that Hong Kong will continue to make use of its strengths in the fields of aviation and cargo to contribute to the development of an international logistics hub in the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officiating at the second Business Conference on Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Development, Lee said the territory will collaborate with other cities in the region to build a comprehensive and modern transport system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will make use of Hong Kong's professional marine services, and cooperate with the mainland and Macau to increase the competitiveness of the Greater Bay Area's port clusters. As for aviation, Hong Kong is developing intermodal cargo‑transhipment with Dongguan, and we have brought forward the development of the Hong Kong International Airport Dongguan Logistics Park," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has also recently signed a shares acquisition agreement with Zhuhai Airport, which strengthens the foundation of passenger services between Beijing, Zhuhai and Hong Kong," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lee said the "one-hour living circle" in the Greater Bay Area has showcased the development results of the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong citizens going north to spend, and mainland citizens coming south to travel and shop has become the norm. This has enhanced exchanges among Hong Kong and the mainland," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The central government's earlier resumption and expansion of the multiple-entry Individual Visit Scheme has allowed more than ten million Shenzhen residents to enter Hong Kong freely, which further injects strong forces towards Hong Kong's tourism, retail and catering industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that his Policy Address in October included various measures to promote development in the area, including regarding the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, and fostering connections in areas such as logistics and aviation qualifications.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity dedicated to empower young people has strived to help low-resourced teenagers become better problem-solvers and be more resilient.
 <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 2008, Kids4Kids has been working with children from less advantaged backgrounds on a number of issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-profit, which is among the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), has helped more than 35,000 pupils and involved over 30,000 volunteers over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matt Coulson, the organisation's executive director, said the initiative funded by the annual drive works with individuals aged between 12 and 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This particular project basically works with low-resourced kids and works on their life skills, works on their integration, works on developing their sense of well-being, their sense of importance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ultimate goal, Coulson said, is to encourage young people use their creativity to solve problems, be engaged with their community, and develop resilience.

  <br>
  Coulson said the organisation will use the funds from OSC to support youths in charting their own paths.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to be spending it to develop some really particular psychological support structure systems for young people, and encouraging them along the journey of entrepreneurship, to allow them to explore a future that isn't just in catering, or isn't just in food services, but it could be anything," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entrepreneurial journey we encourage the kids to go on is all around developing solutions to UNSDG (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals) problems, trying to create solutions for their communities that really deeply engage in positive change making."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    Tap into the mainland database for clinical trials: CE

 Hong Kong's healthcare sector needs to maximise its edge on the international stage by collaborating with its mainland counterparts in clinical trials, according to the chief executive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spelling out his vision on RTHK programme Overview Policy, John Lee reiterated the main objective of reforming the healthcare system is to ensure efficient division of work among the Hospital Authority, the Department of Health and the Primary Healthcare Commission, which was set up in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make primary healthcare accessible for everyone in the community. People need to take good care of themselves, especially before they fall ill so they don't have to rely on treatment. The basis is to have everyone protect their own health on a day-to-day basis," Lee explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another goal, the chief executive stated, is to establish Hong Kong's own drug regulator and speed up registration of new pharmaceutical products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, a drug can only be submitted for approval after it has been registered in at least two reference jurisdictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the aim is to substitute part of that requirement with approved clinical trials, where collaboration with the mainland is essential.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have data from 7.5 million patients. But if we can utilise the data from 1.4 billion people on the mainland, or even just 78 to 80 million in the Greater Bay Area, then the clinical trials will become a lot more effective," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader also stressed that careful planning is needed when establishing a third medical school in the city, to make sure it does not take away students or resources with the two existing institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have only around 2.1 doctors per 1,000 people, compared to the ratio of 2.5 in other advanced economies. There's a lot of catching up to do, and with the current limited intake quota for medical students it's very important to set up a third medical school," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But at the same time I don't want these institutions to compete against each other for students. So right now the idea is to let two medical schools focus on teaching, while the third can focus on research and development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee confirmed multiple universities have expressed interest to take up the initiative, and a working group is now assessing which one is the most suitable candidate and meets all of the Medical Council's requirements.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan on Tuesday said it is time to promote the use of electric vehicles, given the drop in prices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the Green Transformation Roadmap of Public Buses and Taxis, Tse said the government will subsidise the purchase of 600 electric buses and 3,000 electric taxis, with invitation letters to be sent to those eligible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said he believes the incentives will be sufficient to attract operators to opt for electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because the prices are coming down very quickly, I believe very soon, electric vehicles will be very competitive against the conventional vehicles. And therefore, the need for further subsidies in future, I believe, will diminish,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To achieve the aim of all franchised buses and taxis being zero emission vehicles by 2050, the minister said the authorities will review the process in 2027 and then every five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citybus welcomed the government's plan and said it would buy 200 electric buses under the subsidy scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operator also said it would continue to expand its use of hydrogen buses, and stressed it was committed to achieving zero emission operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB, meanwhile, said it currently has more than 80 electric buses, and would consider buying more of them.

 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it would impose visa restrictions on US personnel who are deemed to have "behaved poorly" on Hong Kong-related issues.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Washington had grossly interfered in China's internal affairs and seriously violated principles of international law and basic norms of international relations by imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials over Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has decided to impose visa restrictions on US personnel who have behaved poorly on Hong Kong-related issues. We must emphasise that Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. We urge the US side to genuinely respect China's sovereignty, Hong Kong's rule of law, and cease any form of interference in Hong Kong affairs," Mao said at a news conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington had last month said it would impose fresh sanctions on Hong Kong officials responsible for implementing the SAR's national security law following the jailing of 45 people for subversion.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday rolled out a roadmap for Hong Kong to align its sustainability disclosure requirements with international standards.
 <br>
  <br>
  It says publicly accountable entities, including banks, security brokers and all regulated financial institutions, are required to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure (ISSB) Standards by 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants will release local standards that align with ISSB Standards by the end of this year, with an effective date of August 1 next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from January 1, 2025 major listed companies will be required to adopt a “comply or explain” approach for their disclosures related to the climate requirements in the ISSB Standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those listed in the Hang Seng Composite LargeCap Index will also have to disclose their compliance with climate requirements from January 1, 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will consult the market in 2027 on mandating sustainability reporting against the Hong Kong Standards for listed publicly accountable entities with an expected effective date of January 1, 2028, under a proportionate approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, certain non-listed financial institutions that carry significant weight will also need to adopt local standards no later than 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the SAR is taking consistent steps to boost its competitiveness as a premier financial centre through observing international standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, he added that the roadmap’s launch highlights the government's dedication to promoting green and sustainable financing and investment, while also laying out a clear framework on sustainability reporting for financial institutions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee will travel to Beijing for his annual duty visit on Wednesday to meet senior officials.
 <br>
  <br>
  He will make a four-day visit to the capital to "brief state leaders on the latest economic, social and political situation in Hong Kong", a government statement said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining him on the trip are the Director of the Chief Executive's Office, Carol Yip, and his private secretary Vicki Kwok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Financial Secretary Paul Chan will take turns acting in the chief executive's position over the four-day period ending Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result of the duty visit, a question and answer session with the chief executive and lawmakers in the legislature scheduled for Thursday has been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers will be notified by the secretariat when the session is rescheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Lee announced he would hold a Q&A session in Legco, with topics such as economic growth and expanding Hong Kong's international network to be included in the discussion.

    HK embracing digital transformation in insurance: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is embracing digital transformation in the insurance sector and taking steps to address growing challenges brought by climate change, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The CE was speaking at the Asian Insurance Forum, which drew more than 400 professionals in person and 1,800 online participants this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR is committed to supporting insurtech development through various initiatives, including the Insurtech Sandbox and Open API Framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These initiatives allow insurance providers to experiment with new business models, explore digital products and enhance customer experience in ways that were previously unimaginable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's fast-evolving insurtech business is helping the industry embrace artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain, bringing tangible improvements to businesses as well as consumers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that the SAR is "at the forefront" in developing solutions to combat climate change with measures such as insurance-linked securities and catastrophe bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To date, Hong Kong has issued five catastrophe bonds, raising more than US$700 million for protection against typhoons, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Technological innovation will be a key enabler of insurance industry growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is home to about 160 authorised insurers, including six of the world's top 10 insurance firms, Lee added.

 Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong on Tuesday said 10-minute limits placed on visits to the giant pandas An An and Ke Ke helped prevent overcrowding.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people flocked to the park when the pandas made their public debut on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The crowd control measures were taken after considering the visitor experience and safety concerns. They're necessary because the exhibit can't hold too many people," Pong said on an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With regard to the 10-minute visiting time, we looked at other places and this isn't too short. Some places only allow visitors to stay for three or four minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong also said the public were able to meet the pandas sooner than originally expected, as the animals were adopting very well to their new habitat and are very energetic.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that twin panda cubs at the park are in good shape, with the heavier male starting to develop its baby teeth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair could be able to meet the public from around Lunar New Year, Pong said.

    Lawmaker urges more flexible sports funding system

<img alt="Lawmaker Kenneth Fok (second right) says if billiard sports are downgraded to Tier B status, it may affect their development. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782725_1_20241209170136.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's sports sector lawmaker has called for more flexibility in the funding system for sports, and not just focus on Olympic and Asian Games participation when determining the city's three-tiered support mechanism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who represents the sports, performing arts, culture and publication sector, said on Monday the global sports scene was evolving with events coming in and out in top-level international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Are we just chasing Olympic and Asian Games medals or do we want more? Can we actually have our athletes shine in different international arenas and competitions too?" Fok questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The system should allow for more flexibility, instead of just chasing the Olympic and Asian [Games] medals... The whole mechanism is now more rearward-facing. We're looking at past results only. It creates a system where you first get the results, and then you get the reward."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports in Hong Kong are classified into three levels: Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B, with those in the top tier like fencing and swimming being identified as ones with the potential to excel at the Olympics and athletes receiving the best resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those with a Tier A status are sports with athletes competing in previous Olympics or Asian Games, and are set to continue doing so. Athletes for such sports get funding for training programmes and dedicated coaching, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Support for athletes in the remaining tier depends on individual circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  But billiard sports do not meet the criteria of being included in enough Asian and Olympic games between 2010 and 2030, to pass for the Tier A level of support. As it stands, billiard sports are at risk of losing up to 80 percent of current funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker said the achievements of SAR snooker players should not be disregarded simply because they did not compete in the Olympics and Asian Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the proven results of cue sports in Hong Kong, in terms of our athletes repeatedly gaining world championship status, that should be part of the equation too," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If [billiard sports] are demoted to Tier B, it will not just send a negative image on government support for cue sports despite their results, but it might also impair the ability...to deliver other objectives besides elite athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said it could happen as early as April next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our hands are quite tied, because we have no influence on the policy-making part... But we, and our athletes, will keep doing our job, and we won't waste the resources that the government has given us," Law said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some taxi and transport trade representatives have reacted positively to the government's proposal to make the installation of surveillance cameras in cabs compulsory, saying it could help reduce quarrels between drivers and passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government told the legislature on Monday that in the next two years, it wants to mandate the installation of CCTV cameras in taxi cabins, as well as dashcams and Global Positioning System, along with the provision of at least two electronic payment methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow Kwok-keung, a former chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, described the cameras plan as long overdue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the government should offer financial assistance, saying the trade is going through tough times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is like spring season arriving late. As for costs, you can find CCTV cameras in the market costing around HK$4,700, HK$5,000, or more than HK$7,000," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we're a bit disappointed that it seems the government won't be subsidising the camera installations at all. So we feel a bit unhappy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said e-payment is clearly the trend moving forward and the industry has to bear the responsibility to provide the systems needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick, of the Liberal Party, also welcomed the proposals, noting that the use of CCTV cameras inside taxis is something he has called for for many years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said drivers actually want the cameras to protect themselves, as they're now subject to a points-deduction system that can lead to a licence suspension for malpractice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yick said some drivers have encountered instances of passengers accusing them of engaging in wrongdoing, and cameras could help all sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also brushed aside any privacy concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've checked with the privacy commissioner, and I have got positive answers. Because inside the cab, it's not a private environment, it's semi-private, so you have to know that it's not a closed situation," the lawmaker told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I think the most important thing is to make sure that the passenger is well-aware that the [CCTV] system is on."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for e-payments, Yick said he has come across instances where taxi owners have installed an e-payment system, but the drivers didn't want to use them and so kept them away from passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed the hope that making the systems mandatory would "help Hong Kong's reputation".

    Ex-lawmaker Chim Pui-chung, son convicted of fraud

<img alt="The District Court found former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung and his son guilty of conspiracy to defraud. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782721_1_20241209160826.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung and his son were on Monday found guilty of conspiracy to defraud more than HK$42 million in transactions linked to a listed company.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court ruled that Chim, who was the largest shareholder of Asia Resources, and his son Ricky Chim, who was the chairman, conspired with mainland businessman Ma Zhonghong to defraud the company, its board and shareholders between July 2013 and November 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case involved the issuance of convertible notes to increase the company's share capital while concealing a secret "shell company" agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma had agreed to pay the ex-lawmaker HK$210 million for 70 to 75 percent of Asia Resources' issued shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma's associate and businesswoman, Wong Poe-lai, was convicted of money laundering in connection with the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  A judge in 2022 issued an arrest warrant for the businessman who failed to report to the police and appear in court.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his written judgement, Judge Ernest Lin cited evidence found by the ICAC in Chim's office in 2018, which revealed the former lawmaker as the mastermind behind the shareholding control scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial transactions were found to be unusually complex and "could not possibly be considered normal business activities", which were believed to hide the identities of those involved, the judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said the elder Chim also made use of his influence to arrange for his son to become the firm’s chairman and executive director and orchestrate transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge criticised the pair for treating the listed company as private property, harming both Asia Resources and its shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The victims were not only Asia Resources but also the company's small shareholders, who were denied both the option of a mandatory takeover offer and saw their personal investments turned into tools for others' profit-making," Lin wrote in the judgement.
  <br>
  <br>
  While shell company acquisitions aren't illegal, their actions prevented the board from protecting shareholders' interests, Lin noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three defendants were remanded in custody until sentencing next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ICAC spokesperson said the graft-buster will continue to work closely with financial regulators to combat corruption and crimes involving listed companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ICAC will strive to uphold integrity and fair operation of the Hong Kong financial market and to foster the confidence of stakeholders in the financial system," the spokesperson said in a statement.

    Privacy breaches spark fraud alert for jobseekers

<img alt="The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data carried out investigations into JobsDB and eight organisations that placed 'blind ads', where the identity of those behind the post is not clear. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782705_2_20241209161751.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Swindlers could be harvesting the personal information of jobseekers to commit fraud, a watchdog warned on Monday, after it found privacy breaches involving online job adverts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) said it carried out an investigation into JobsDB and eight organisations that used the platform to post "blind ads" – where the identity of those said to be recruiting isn't clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All of the eight organisations that placed the aforesaid blind ads on JobsDB and requested job applicants to submit their personal data to unknown recruiting companies and JobsDB that published the same on its platform were involved in the unfair collection of the job applicants’ personal data, and this constituted contraventions of... the PDPO [Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance]," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it has therefore served enforcement notices on JobsDB and three of the organisations, ordering them to take measures to remedy the contraventions and prevent them from happening again. The other five organisations have been sent advisory notices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hermina Ng, PCPD's senior legal counsel, said the eight organisations involved businesses in areas including financial securities, apparel retail, Chinese medicine and transport services. But she also warned that some online job adverts may not be legitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The privacy commissioner would also like to call upon other operators of online recruitment platforms to beware of anyone using blind ads to perpetrate fraud or collect personal data by unfair means and to carefully review recruitment advertisements to identify blind ads and avoid publishing the same in order to protect the personal data privacy of members of the public," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Blind ads may be used as an unscrupulous means to collect personal data and may be misused by swindlers to collect personal data for fraudulent activities. When jobseekers are unable to ascertain the employers’ identities, they should check and verify the information contained in the blind ads carefully and should not respond to the blind ads arbitrarily and submit their personal data."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng also urged employers to increase transparency when placing recruitment adverts, by disclosing their identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  JobsDB said it has now required all companies to disclose their name and contact information in their advertisements "for the benefit of applicants".
  <br>
  <br>
  The platform also said the posting of blind ads was suspended in November, and when it resumes from Thursday, employers will not be able to directly access an applicant's personal information without revealing their identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The candidates' personal data that we collect – including their current role, industry, and the types of jobs they look for – is only used in connection with the services we provide, as disclosed in our privacy statement. We do not share personal data with third parties, other than as disclosed in our privacy statement or as permitted by law," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  JobsDB added it took steps to ensure job ads posted were genuine, including by manually verifying anyone placing recruitment adverts.

    Govt dept gets enforcement notice over Covid data leak

<img alt="Earlier this year a data leak was reported involving some 17,000 public housing tenants who underwent mandatory Covid tests in 2022. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782702_1_20241209135743.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government department failed to take adequate measures to protect the personal data of thousands of people ordered to undergo Covid tests back in 2022 and which was later found to be freely available online, the privacy commissioner's office said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In April this year the watchdog alerted officials to the fact that information including names, phone numbers, ID card numbers, addresses and Covid vaccination status of more than 17,000 public housing tenants was accessible online, without the need for any account or password.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blunder, by the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD), was made public a few days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an investigation by the watchdog, the department said that given it had stopped using the services of the e-form platform involved in the breach, it wrongly believed the personal data in question had been automatically deleted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was only when EMSD became aware of the incident on 30 April 2024 that it requested the contractor to remove the personal data involved," said Hermina Ng, senior legal counsel for the privacy commissioner's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said the department had a lack of written policies on the retention of personal data, had failed to take the initiative to get the information deleted, and didn't follow up the issue with the e-form platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EMSD merely assumed that the contractor would act on its own volition after the expiry of the contract. The EMSD had never urged, checked or reminded the contractor to delete the personal data from the e-form platform, and had never sought to understand or monitor the progress or effectiveness of the contractor’s relevant actions," the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EMSD, as the data user, should not merely await passively for the contractor to take action, nor should it ride on its trust in the contractor and not to verify the work done by the contractor. This is another obvious deficiency."
  <br>
  <br>
  The privacy watchdog concluded that the EMSD failed to ensure the data collected was kept only for as long as necessary, and that it didn't safeguard the personal information from unauthorised or accidental access.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said an enforcement notice has been issued to the EMSD, directing it to take measures to remedy the violations and prevent similar situations from happening again in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the watchdog's findings, the department said it immediately conducted an in-depth enquiry with the contractor about the operational details of the server platform to ensure the complete removal of the relevant data.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EMSD also said it introduced a number of measures, including developing a dedicated platform to store personal data on its own servers, to try to prevent a repeat of similar incidents in future.

    Govt to mandate cameras and e-payments for cabs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport officials on Monday said they plan to require taxi drivers to install surveillance cameras inside their vehicles by the end of 2026, and provide electronic payment methods by the end of next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  On top of that, drivers would also be required by law to install dashcams and Global Positioning Systems, to monitor their behaviour and collect data to help with investigations by law enforcement officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  In documents submitted to the legislature, transport officials said in the past year or so, lawmakers, taxi trade representatives and some members of the public had all said they want the installation of CCTV cameras in the vehicle cabins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This can record the situation inside the cabin. If disputes arise between taxi drivers and passengers, the footage can become evidence for the police or the Transport Department to follow up on the complaints, and investigate suspected malpractices such as overcharging and refusing a hire," the Transport and Logistics Bureau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said drivers would be allowed to pick their own devices, which would be properly sealed to guard against tampering, and data collected must be encrypted and only kept for 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The information would only be transferred to a planned Transport Department central platform when complaints arise or if there was an accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials stressed they attach great importance to privacy protection, and would contact the privacy commissioner to discuss guidelines on handling the data and offering training to drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  On payment methods, the bureau said there are still plenty of drivers who only take cash, and this can easily cause disputes as passengers, especially tourists, find this very inconvenient.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials proposed that drivers provide at least two types of electronic payment methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said while this might create extra costs for drivers, there are plenty of such platforms which offer promotions, such exempting device charges or handling fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said it plans to table legal amendments for the proposals in the second quarter of next year.

    Streetathon organiser says instructions could improve

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of Hong Kong Streetathon has admitted that instructions could have been clearer after some half-marathon runners went miles out of their way in Sunday’s event.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both the half-marathon and full marathon started near the East Coast Park in Causeway Bay and finished at San Shan Road in To Kwa Wan. But half-marathon runners did not have to go through the Tseung Lam Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andes Leung, CEO and co-founder of RunOurCity Foundation, said around 20 to 30 half-marathon runners accidentally entered the Tseung Kwan O–Lam Tin Tunnel when they should have turned right.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung told an RTHK programme on Monday that while the signs were set up correctly, staff could have taken more initiative to instruct runners where to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not saying the organiser can't improve. I think the staff could have been more proactive. They could have reminded runners, face-to-face, that full marathon runners should go straight ahead, while half-marathon runners should turn right. That would have been better," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that staff training will be improved to prevent similar issues from happening again.

 When Fok Mei-ling's son was born in 1991, he was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy - a rare genetic disorder. She was told he may not live past his first birthday.

  "Eating was not possible, movement was not possible, and of course, breathing, because all voluntary muscles are affected. But I didn't quit," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1998, Fok started the charity, FSMA - Families of SMA Foundation - after she found out that the disease need not be fatal given proper and aggressive medical intervention.
  <br>
  <br>
  And her son is living proof. He is now 33-years-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  FSMA is one of the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), an annual charity campaign holding fundraising projects for over 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok, the charity's founder and chairperson, says they aim to relieve hardship and suffering faced by SMA patients and their families, and also raise awareness about SMA diseases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do donate medical equipment, wheelchairs and bespoke baby buggies. We also give them free high nutritional supplements because these are very expensive," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also lately have the drug delivery program... and we also offer some emergency home help service, part-time for parents who need some help at home."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said she hoped more SMA patients could receive assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[There] is also an important project. It's called Mercy Medical Management. We send a multi-disciplinary medical team with the doctor on Zoom, registered nurses, technicians with medical equipment to go and do the tests."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the programme exactly that Operation Santa Claus will help so that we can increase the number of patients that we help who are technology dependent for their survival," she said.

    3D scans of Notre Dame aid restoration efforts

<img alt="First mass open to the public at the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, five-and-a-half years after a fire ravaged the Gothic masterpiece. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782660_1_20241209090420.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An architect in Hong Kong says laser scanning of Paris' famous Notre Dame Cathedral, carried out by late art historian Andrew Tallon, played a crucial role in the restoration of the Gothic gem.
 <br>
  <br>
  The more than 850-year-old cathedral has finally reopened its doors after it was partially destroyed by a fire in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the timber roof and the structure's spire were ravaged by the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu Ka-sing, Associate Professor of Practice at the Faculty of Architecture from the University of Hong Kong told RTHK that Tallon's scans of the interior and exterior of the cathedral conducted before the blaze provided basic information for the restoration team to start with.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically, it is the process that can allow the site to create a digital twin of the historic building by collecting a range of geospatial information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu noted that the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum in China cooperated with France on the restoration, and its deputy director Zhou Ping paid a visit to France earlier this year to gain a better understanding of the restoration process.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the international heritage conservation aspect, both France and China are of the highest levels," said Yu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also given the fact that the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum [Site Museum] has also got many burned timber debris, so sharing some similarity with Notre Dame, the two sites have some good knowledge for exchange."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite rolling out the red carpet to the public, the 700-million euro restoration project has yet to be completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tasks, such as the restoration of the chevet and sacristy, as well as the installation of stained glass windows will continue.

    HK Streetathon ends with some going the extra mile

<img alt="The Hong Kong Streetathon featured a full marathon around Victoria Harbour, a cross-harbour half marathon, and a 10km race from Tseung Kwan O to Kwun Tong. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782615_1_20241208180257.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 17,000 runners took part in this year's Hong Kong Streetathon on Sunday, but some unintentionally went further than the standard distance during one of the races.
 <br>
  <br>
  The full marathon around Victoria Harbour kicked off the races early this morning under chilly weather, as temperatures dipped to their lowest so far this winter at 16 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day also featured a cross-harbour half marathon and a 10km race from Tseung Kwan O to Kwun Tong.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first time, local delicacies were dished out to runners as part of what's being dubbed a "Five-senses Marathon".
  <br>
  <br>
  Music and fragrance diffusers also featured along parts of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tiffany, a 10km race participant, said she was delighted there was poon choi, a communal dish of foods served in layers which is often eaten on festive occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a band performing along the way to cheer us up, and someone gave me a high-five. There was also something to eat – poon choi with mushrooms. That could give runners a boost," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Patsy, a runner who's visually impaired, the route this time around was a bit different than last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to challenge myself and see what I was capable of. The most important thing was that I had a guide who took good care of me and encouraged me," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the 21-kilometre half marathon saw some runners go an extra nine kilometres due to unclear instructions.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, who was among those who ran the additional stretch, said he was unable to see where to go during part of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There were traffic cones and a bunch of staff members. We couldn't see any of the signs at all," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If only one or two runners could not see the signs, then it could be their problem. But when you had more than 10 people go the wrong way, would it be an issue with the organisers?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said they were looking into the incident to see whether there was human error involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all of the runners who showed up finished the race, organisers said, with more than 3,000 coming from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four participants were hospitalised, while 110 others suffered minor injuries.

    Hong Kong corals in healthy condition: AFCD

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) on Sunday said Hong Kong's coral reefs are generally healthy, although bleaching was observed during summer this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department, along with the non-profit Reef Check Foundation, conducted its five-month review of local corals from June at 33 sites of ecological importance, which included nine marine parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found that coral coverage at the sites ranged from 12.8 percent to 75.1 percent, with the highest coverage recorded at Hoi Ha Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven sites had more than 50 percent coral coverage, in which five of them were marine parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average health index of corals across all sites was 3.95, which is above the general average of three.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the AFCD said large-scale coral bleaching reappeared after it last occurred in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The department has engaged a group of local coral and marine science experts to consult with and gather their views on conserving corals in Hong Kong, and to explore future directions of relevant research and conservation work, such as identification and enhancement of monitoring for the key environmental factors associated with coral bleaching as well as devising research projects for alleviating the impact of coral bleaching in the local environment," an AFCD spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said corals which saw the most bleaching were recovering due to the influx of cooler waters from last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results also indicated there were no signs destructive fishing practices, but abandoned nets were found at 12 sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said the impact was low and the netting would be removed.

    Officials optimistic about tourism sector this month

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism officials on Sunday expressed optimism the industry would enjoy a merry festive period this year, in part because of the boost by the resumption of the multi-entry permit scheme for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new tourism minister, Rosanna Law, said Saturday saw some 145,000 visitor arrivals from the mainland, nearly 30 percent more than the daily average for November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law believed this was due to last Sunday's resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents, saying various sectors should seize the opportunities brought by these visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many tourists coming in so let's work together and show a smile," Law told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've heard mainland travellers saying in interviews that we are smiling more and that our Mandarin has improved. I hope this will continue. It's important to keep an open mind and think of ways to make good use of business opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Travel Industry Council, meanwhile, said it expects overall tourist arrivals year-on-year to rise by five to 10 percent this month, citing the visa scheme change and a series of upcoming events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "December is also our peak tourist season, with many winter promotional events organised by the Tourism Board taking place. We are very confident there'll be more visitors this December, compared to previous [years]," the council's chairwoman, Gianna Hsu, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The launch of the Kai Tak Sports Park, the commencement of the airport's three-runway system, and the official debut of giant pandas, also encourages more tourists to come and see the cityscape of Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council and a number of tourism sector groups called on the industry to reinforce Hong Kong's brand as a hospitable destination.

    People flock to Ocean Park for An An and Ke Ke debut

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panda enthusiasts gathered at Ocean Park on Sunday to get a sight of An An and Ke Ke, as the two pandas gifted by Beijing made their public debut today.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kamy Yeung, who has been following the news about the animals, told RTHK that it is a great day to give the pandas a big welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I happen to be seeing them eating breakfast in the morning... and it’s quite nice to see them being lively and smiley. It’s nice to see all the enthusiasm from everyone around the world to celebrate the joy at the park,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore tourist Rachel Wang spent around HK$1,100 on panda souvenirs. She said she finds An An adorable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s so active, but having seen the pandas, I think Ke Ke is very demure and very loveable. I’m really excited and I love pandas to start with... actually I want to be a panda as well after seeing them,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Mezzatesta from the United States said he woke up early just to see the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I like the girl panda a little bit more, she seemed a little bit more shy, very cute to see her get all nervous seeing a bunch of people. We queued up at around 9am. I was very excited to see the pandas. I woke up at six in the morning ready to go to Ocean Park to see the pandas,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park has implemented dispersion measures, in which around 100 tickets are given out every 15 minutes. Each visitor is only allowed to stay in the area for 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the debut of An An and Ke Ke, the new panda twins will greet the public in the first quarter next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Sunday, the new tourism minister, Rosanna Law, said the panda naming competition had allowed the public to participate in a meaningful way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the winner of the competition, which received some 20,000 entries, had given good reasons why the original names should be kept.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister described the names as approachable adding it was good there was no need to change them.

    'No worries over undersubscribed bonds'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The finance chief on Sunday said there is no need for concern after the latest offering of retail infrastructure bonds, totalling HK$20 billion, fell short of its target.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 128,000 investors signed up for the bonds during the offering period that ended on Friday, with the final issuance size expected to be around HK$17.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said people should not worry about the undersubscription of the latest round of bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Institutional investors have oversubscribed for the bonds by three or four times, so we don't have to worry about the amount raised from bonds this year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently there are many investment options. We can also see that in future, many high-quality companies will come to Hong Kong to list, so the investment market will be vibrant."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government previously told lawmakers that it had doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion, from its forecast of a little more than HK$48 billion announced in February's budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said it might take some time for the government to achieve a fiscal balance, but cautioned the process should not be done too quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe it will take several years to achieve a fiscal balance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've spoken to credit rating agencies and they agreed that major economies have been experiencing financial deficits during the pandemic. They're against achieving a fiscal balance aggressively and within a short period of time, such as one or two years, by significantly cutting spending. This would not only hurt people's livelihoods, but would also cause the economy to contract, which is counterproductive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance chief said on his weekly blog that the government is committed to coordinating different mega events to "achieve maximum synergy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past two weeks, Hong Kong has held a number of fashion and design events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said designers and entrepreneurs from all over the world that have come to Hong Kong for large-scale international arts and culture galas "highly recognised" the capability of the SAR in curating and coordinating such events.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added these events allowed people in the arts and creative industries to more easily reach out to potential partners.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing chief Winnie Ho said officials could reward informants who alert authorities to poor quality sub-divided units (SDUs), when the flats are subject to a future regulatory regime.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is now collecting public views on its proposal to require each SDU to be no less than less than eight square metres in size, or 86 square feet, as well as having features like at least one window and an individual toilet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials propose that landlords who violate the requirements in future could be subject to a maximum three-year jail term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the reward system might be needed to dig out "hidden" sub-standard flats, but she stressed officials are also gauging public views over the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the public has seen the proposed standards and finds them reasonable, and she described the penalty as rather heavy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that everyone won't have to wait until informant and reward systems - that everyone agrees to follow the new rules, register the flats," she said on a TVB programme that aired on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll see how effective the new system is - and we'll see if we need to offer rewards, in addition to the regular reporting system."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that the Rating and Valuation Department has received two complaints so far from sub-divided flat tenants who said they were forced out by landlords because of the proposed regime, and officials will handle different complaints regarding rental issues.

 The two giant pandas gifted to Hong Kong by the central government will retain their original names, An An and Ke Ke, which symbolise peace, stability, and endless possibilities for the future of the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government and Ocean Park organised a naming competition in October for these national treasures, and received over 22,600 suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a greeting ceremony at Ocean Park on Saturday, it was announced that the judges had selected the suggestion to keep the original names of the five-year-old pandas, as the Chinese pronunciation of "An" and "Ke" together resembles the word "encore," symbolising ongoing good fortune for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it is so meaningful. There is more of a sense of belonging by keeping their original names," said a woman surnamed To.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman surnamed Li said she fears people might confuse the new An An with the previous panda of the same name, who passed away in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's fine, but some people might think of the old An An. That An An lived in Hong Kong for a very long time, so we were really sad when he passed away. It should be fine to reuse the name because the new panda is used to this name anyway. It should help him adjust a lot easier," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his speech at the ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said he is ecstatic for the pair to officially meet the public on Sunday, adding that the pandas will serve as tourism ambassadors for both the nation and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This initiative aims to create a panda craze across the city and bring giant pandas to different corners of Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will continue to seize the opportunities presented by the giant pandas, actively collaborating with various sectors to organise more related activities and launch locally themed panda products, providing visitors with a unique panda experience and boosting Hong Kong's tourism and retail industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said that the giant pandas exemplify the nation's successful conservation efforts, and he affirmed that the SAR is dedicated to collaborating with experts from the mainland to advance panda conservation initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will work with Ocean Park to advance panda conservation and outreach efforts. Various educational activities will be organised to allow more friends from both local and international communities to learn about the achievements and strengths of the nation and Hong Kong in conservation, reversing the trends of species extinction, and promoting biodiversity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that Hong Kong is home to the largest number of giant pandas outside the mainland, with a total of six, including also Ying Ying, Le Le and their newborn twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, many people also gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui to take photos with the 2,500 giant panda sculptures in the first stop of the "Panda Go! Fest HK" exhibition.

    'Tai Lam Tunnel fee adjustment plans are balanced'

<img alt="Transport chief Mable Chan says the bureau is actively improving transport facilities that connect to the Tai Lam Tunnel. Photo courtesy of Mable Chan's blog" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782506_2_20241209083606.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New transport chief Mable Chan said on Saturday that further fee reductions at the Tai Lam Tunnel are not possible, as additional vehicle flow will lead to congestion during peak hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her blog, she said the bureau is actively improving transport facilities that connect to the tunnel, to ensure the takeover can be executed smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government announced on Thursday it plans to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel after it takes control of the infrastructure in the New Territories on May 31 next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles would pay HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during normal hours, and HK$18 during non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for commercial vehicles – tolls are down from current level of between HK$64 and HK$79 to HK$43 throughout the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the time-varying tolls, in which vehicles will pay different fees according to "peak", "normal" and "non-peak" hours, mean the fees for all vehicle types will be largely reduced, with "non-peak" hour fees set at the lowest possible price.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Road pricing is an important transport management measure to regulate vehicular flow. Tai Lam Tunnel, including its control areas, is 10 kilometres long, which is the length of five Tsing Ma Bridges. The maintenance cost is not low," she wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tunnels are an important asset of the government. We have to abide by our strict fiscal discipline, and uphold the users pay principle," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the plans will help the tunnel reach its full capacity.

    Pokémon Go trainers embark on city safari in HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pokémon enthusiasts from around the world are in Hong Kong for the city's inaugural "Pokémon Go City Safari" event, where the popular mobile app will take users to landmarks and historic places in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Niantic, the game's creators, said the two-day event that started on Saturday is meant to immerse both locals and tourists in the city's rich culture and architecture, while enjoying the augmented reality game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lisa Broadwell, from Sweden, has been playing the game since 2019, and she said these events are ideal for those who enjoy discovering new cities in unique and innovative ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I like the walk and catch aspect of Pokémon Go so this event seemed perfect to able to walk around, see things and just be walking and catching and seeing the sites as I go along. It fits my style of playing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still a bit jet-lagged. We came from America, came from Las Vegas. It was a 15 and a half hours flight, so we're still trying to get our bearings of where we are or what we are doing," said Jim Haughey, who often travels for these events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elaine Hui, director of APAC regional marketing at Niantic, said Hong Kong's unique qualities made it stand out when they were selecting a venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to find a city that is really easy to travel, and I think Hong Kong has that quality. On the other hand, we want to have something special for this city, and Hong Kong has that quality, too," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have East and West. They have very new, tall buildings, very iconic buildings, but they also have neighbourhoods, which are a little bit older, but with a lot of history. That's why we think Hong Kong is a good place."

    Subdivided tenants' rights protected by law: minister

<img alt="Housing minister Winnie Ho stressed that the basic housing unit policy is not yet finalised. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782497_1_20241207130131.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Saturday the Rating and Valuation Department has received two complaints of landlords forcing tenants of subdivided units to move out so they can be renovated to meet government requirements.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his policy address in October, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to replace substandard subdivided units with so-called "basic housing units". These must be no less than 8 square metres, or 86 square feet, and have an individual toilet and at least one window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Ho said tenants' rights are protected under the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tenant's security of tenure is protected. The tenancy contract is regulated for two years plus an additional two years. If water and electricity bills are separate, landlords are not allowed to overcharge for them. The tenant's fees for these services cannot be higher than the service charges that the landlord pays to water and electricity companies," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho stressed that the basic housing unit policy is still under consultation, and further adjustments may be made before the bill is tabled at the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Ho said the decision to have the South Island Line (West) adopt the smart transit system cut six years from the construction time, allowing the government to advance the redevelopment of Wah Fu public housing estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government announced on Friday that the estate's last remaining residents now have to leave by 2034/35, six years ahead of schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday the transport chief announced that the railway will use the Smart and Green Mass Transit System, rather than an underground heavy rail system. The green system, which runs above ground, will save almost six years," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We originally set aside land in the estate for an underground station... and could only move residents after the station was built. But now that land is freed up, and we can put up buildings immediately, speeding up the redevelopment," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government announcement also laid out clearance and rehousing arrangements for the first phase of the redevelopment of Choi Hung Estate. Residents of Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House will need to move out before April 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said redevelopment decisions are made according to the condition of the estate and its urgency.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the government is yet to discuss building heights, plot ratios and road networks of the redeveloped Choi Hung estate.

    Stress tests to tweak Kai Tak transport links

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's new transport minister vowed on Saturday to ensure that the new Kai Tak Sports Park's transport links is capable of meeting every possible eventuality.
 <br>
  <br>
  The arena and sports ground will host a stress test involving 12,000 people on Sunday as the bureau assesses the facility's readiness for large events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme, Mable Chan, who took office on Thursday, said the tests are intended to ensure that the preparation work at the park is completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from us, the various transport operators including the MTR, buses, and taxis will be involved. We hope that through the various stress tests, we will step up our mobilisation, our preparation, and make ourselves better prepared for different scenarios," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So when the sports park is commissioned, we will have a better and holistic preparation to cater for different scenarios, and give our best to make this (a) success and give the best service to locals and visitors," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the bureau will adopt a two-pronged approach to meet the public's expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it would adopt new technologies and would also strive to have an innovative mindset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the contractor for the Northern Link project will be finalised next year - depending on the final arrangements and designs.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the "smart and green" mass transit system to be used in Kai Tak and East Kowloon, Chan said the bureau had received more than 30 expressions of interest from local, mainland and overseas companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government will hold a tender next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed that the new system can serve as a medium capacity transport linking the public with conventional rail systems, even though it won't have the passenger capacity of traditional heavy networks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the government will monitor fare levels for the new systems.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The No. 3 alarm fire in Aberdeen was put out at 8.55pm on Friday, almost five hours after it started.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the blaze broke out at a shipyard on Shum Wan Road at 4.11pm, and was upgraded to a No. 3 alarm around 30 minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters pointed out that because many of the vessels under repair at the shipyard were fibreglass boats, that exacerbated the spread of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added that the sheer size of the shipyard also made it difficult to bring the fire under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 220 firefighters and rescue workers were brought in to fight the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four fire boat monitors, four jets and breathing apparatus teams were also deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  61 people had to be evacuated, but no injuries were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Lau, who owns a shipyard in the area, said she suffered major losses as a result of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I am very sad. How would you feel if you lost everything in less than an hour? How would you feel?"
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Cheung, whose shipyard was unscathed, said the situation could’ve been worse if the fire broke out at night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only positive thing is that the fire broke out in the afternoon. If it had been now, at night… this place wouldn't be saved in time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At night time, everybody would have left the shipyard, and it would be too late to call the police."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they're still probing the cause of the fire.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Friday issued a warning about a stress-relieving toy that comes with a syringe, urging shops to remove the item from their shelves immediately.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the toy could hurt children and parents should stop their kids from playing with it right away.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, authorities said they inspected toy shops across Hong Kong after receiving a complaint, but have not found anything so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Customs will continue to closely monitor the market situation and step up patrols. If found, the department will take resolute enforcement action," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  A video circulating online shows a person using a syringe to inflate a mini baby doll, creating a bubble effect.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chief Executive has appointed Kennedy Wong as the chairman of the Council of the Baptist University (HKBU), and Michael Ngai as the head of the City University (CityU) Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  John Lee has also reappointed Lam Tai-fai as the chairman of the Polytechnic University (PolyU) Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appointments will take effect from January 1, for a term of three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKBU, CityU and PolyU are important assets of Hong Kong, providing constant impetus for Hong Kong's development into an international post-secondary education hub, and commanding high expectations from the government and the public," the CE, who's the chancellor of these universities, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new appointees are all prominent leaders in society. They have been dedicated to serving the community in different fields over the years. They possess outstanding capabilities and rich experience, and have made remarkable contributions to Hong Kong's education sector."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that he believes the new appointees will steer the universities to new heights.

 At least nine people were evacuated over a fire in Aberdeen on Friday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out at a shipyard on Shum Wan Road at around 4.10pm, and was upgraded to a No 3 alarm half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least three jets as well as two breathing apparatus teams were deployed to the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating online showed large plumes of thick smoke billowing into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Members of the public who are being affected by the smoke and an unusual odour carried by the wind are advised to close their doors and windows and stay calm," the Fire Services Department said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court on Friday rejected a bid by an inmate jailed for inciting secession to challenge the authorities' decision denying him early release under the city's homegrown national security law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ma Chun-man, also known as “Captain America 2.0” for dressing up as the comic book character at anti-government protests in 2019, was jailed for five years for promoting “Hong Kong independence”.
  <br>
  <br>
  After serving two-thirds of his sentence in March, Ma was denied an early release normally granted for good behaviour in prison, in line with the provisions of Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commissioner of Correctional Services made the decision two days after the new security law took effect, saying he was "not satisfied that an early release of the prisoner will not be contrary to the interests of national security".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma filed a judicial review, arguing it was unfair and that the commissioner should have taken into account his “legitimate expectation” for early release.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written judgement handed down on Friday, judge Alex Lee ruled that the commissioner's decision was a "holistic, predictive and evaluative exercise based on a consideration of all the relevant factors".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma also failed to explain how his "legitimate expectation" of an early release would affect the national security assessment, the judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am unable to see how the fact that a prisoner based on the past practice of the CSD [Correctional Services Department] has a 'legitimate expectation' for early release may either increase or reduce the national security risk that might arise from his or her early release," Lee wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling means Ma will need to serve his full term until November next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The last remaining residents of the Wah Fu public housing estate in Pok Fu Lam that is set to be redeveloped will have to leave their homes several years earlier than envisaged, with officials planning to bring forward the third and final clearance and rehousing phase of the project.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tenants of Wah Chui House and Wah King House were originally expected to have vacated their homes by 2040/41, but the new plan announced on Friday is for these units to be empty by 2034/35.
  <br>
  <br>
  The residents involved will be able to move into the first buildings finished at the new Wah Fu Estate, Housing Authority officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first clearance phase, involving five other blocks, is still set to take place between 2026 and 2030 at the latest and the second phase, covering 11 blocks, is to be carried out by 2030/31.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they can bring the third phase forward thanks to the government’s decision to use a "smart and green mass transit system" for the future South Island Line (West), instead of the heavy rail project originally planned. This change will allow sites at the estate to be freed up sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The estate, next to Waterfall Bay, was built in 1967 and the 18 blocks are home to some 9,000 households.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, officials also announced clearance and rehousing arrangements for the first phase of the redevelopment of Choi Hung Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said residents of Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House will need to move out before April 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elderly tenants affected can apply to live in blocks scheduled for redevelopment in the second or third phase of the project, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi Hung Estate, with its 11 blocks, was built in the 1960s. It is home to about 17,500 people.

    More subsidised dental services on the way
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782399_1_20241206163049.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday said it will roll out a series of projects to help people access dental services, with a focus on those most in need.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care suggested in a report that the administration should strengthen dental care for grassroots residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Primary Dental Co-care Pilot Scheme to be implemented in the first quarter of next year, the government will provide a subsidy of HK$200 for those aged 13 to 17 to access services such as teeth assessment and scaling in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinics can set their own fees, but these must be transparent. Around 370,000 teenagers are predicted to benefit from the scheme each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, from the second quarter of next year, people with financial difficulties can enrol in the Community Dental Support Programme to get subsidised services such as check-ups, fillings, tooth extraction and painkillers from non-profit organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who do not have to pay for medical expenses will be fully subsidised by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients approved by the Hospital Authority to have their medical fees partly waived, living allowance recipients aged 65 to 74, and people with a referral from social workers will only have to pay around 10 percent of the fees involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 40,000 quotas will be available under the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee said the government is working with NGOs to enable more underprivileged people to see a dentist.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have rounds of meetings with all relevant NGOs in Hong Kong, and most of them express very keen interest in collaborating with the government, but at the same time they do express some constraints such as manpower," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Upon knowing that we are going to have more supply of dental health professionals, they [NGOs] are more ready and feel more comfortable to work with us."
  <br>
  <br>
  An online queuing system for general public sessions at Department of Health dental clinics will also be available from December 30.

    Giant red ball popping up across Hong Kong

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge bright red ball is popping up in various places in Hong Kong from Friday until next Sunday as part of "the world’s longest-running street artwork".
 <br>
  <br>
  Since its debut in 2001, the enormous sphere has criss-crossed the globe, visiting cities including Paris, Chicago, London and Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong marks its 48th stop and it will make appearances at 10 spots across the SAR, starting with the Central Piers and ending on The Peak.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has already drawn curious spectators for selfies, but Anna preferred to sketch it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just a one-off opportunity to come and draw it. I draw, I sketch all across Hong Kong, so I love to capture scenes in Hong Kong and this is just a rare opportunity to do something different. It's only here today," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always interesting. I think any art project anywhere is interesting and it's always good to support the arts and you want more to come here."
  <br>
  <br>
  American artist Kurt Perschke, the creator of the RedBall project, said he was happy to have the art work showcased in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The project has been in Europe, in the US, all over in Sydney. I think one of the things that I've been excited about to bring it to Hong Kong is to see how the Hong Kong people respond to the piece and to see how we can explore and have fun with the city of Hong Kong, which is such a dynamic and amazing city. I've wanted to bring it here for a long time," he said.
