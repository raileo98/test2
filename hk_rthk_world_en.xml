  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's ruling coalition has lost its majority after snap elections, Japanese media projected early on Monday, in what would be a major blow to new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba, 67, called Sunday's election only days after taking office on October 1, aiming to bolster his position and that of his scandal-hit Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost continuously for seven decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But national broadcaster NHK and other media outlets reported in the hours after polls closed that the LDP – in the party's worst result since 2009 – together with its long-term junior coalition partner Komeito had fallen short of the 233 seats needed for a majority in Japan's lower house.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Voters in the world's fourth-largest economy have been rankled by rising prices and the fallout from a party slush fund scandal that helped sink previous premier Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP remains the top party in Japan's parliament, and a change of government is not expected. But the results create political uncertainty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Falling short of a majority makes it difficult for Ishiba to get his party’s policies through parliament, and he may need to find a third coalition partner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP’s coalition retains a majority in the less powerful upper house. Public broadcaster NHK reported that the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are receiving severe judgement," Ishiba told NHK earlier on Sunday while it was still unclear whether the coalition would secure enough seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Voters "expressed their strong desire for the LDP to do some reflection and become a party that will act in line with the people's will," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Footage from the LDP headquarters showed gloomy faces as projections based on exit polls indicated Ishiba's justice and agriculture ministers were likely to lose their seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda, made huge gains to 148 seats, from its previous 98.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We accomplished our goal of preventing the ruling coalition from a majority, which was a major achievement,” Noda said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noda called the election a rare chance for a change of government, and said he seeks to lead a coalition with other opposition groups to do so. But his party has had trouble finding partners, and some voters were skeptical about the opposition’s ability and inexperience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Ishiba, potential additional partners include the Democratic Party of the People, which calls for lower taxes, and the conservative Japan Innovation Party.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   DPP head Yuichiro Tamaki said he was open to “a partial alliance.” Innovation Party chief Nobuyuki Baba has denied any intention to cooperate. As of early Monday, DPP had 28 seats and the Innovation Party 38.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Experts say a CDPJ-led government is not in the picture because of its lack of viable policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “If they take power and try to change the economic and diplomatic policies of the current government, they will only end up collapsing right away,” said Izuru Makihara, a University of Tokyo professor of politics and public policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Realistically, Ishiba's ruling coalition would seek a partnership with either the Innovation Party or the Democratic Party of the People”, he said. (Agencies)

  <img alt='Georgian president Salome Zurabishvili has accused Moscow of orchestrating a special operation that resulted in the "total falsification of the election".
Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776472_1_20241028030850.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Georgian opposition on Sunday called for protests and the European Union demanded an investigation into "irregularities" after a disputed legislative vote that showed a win for the ruling party.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pro-Western President Salome Zurabishvili accused Moscow of being behind the election fraud, calling it a "Russian special operation".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Amid angry opposition claims over the result, Zurabishvili called for a rally on Monday. Jailed former president Mikheil Saakashvili also called for mass protests.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Union had warned that Saturday's vote could determine Tbilisi's chances of joining the bloc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   EU council president Charles Michel wrote on X that Georgian authorities should "swiftly, transparently and independently investigate and adjudicate electoral irregularities and allegations thereof.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These alleged irregularities must be seriously clarified and addressed," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After meeting with opposition leaders in Tbilisi, Zurabishvili said there had been a "total falsification of the election".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are witnesses and victims of a Russian special operation, a modern form of hybrid war against the Georgian people," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   International observers said Saturday's election was "marred by an uneven playing field, pressure and tension". An EU parliament mission also expressed concern about "democratic backsliding", saying it had seen instances of "ballot box stuffing" and the "physical assault" of observers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saakashvili said on Facebook that opposition lawmakers should renounce their parliamentary seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Now is the time for mass protests. We must show the world that we are fighting for freedom and that we are a people who will not tolerate injustice," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official tallies from more than 99 percent of precincts showed the ruling Georgian Dream party winning 54 percent of the vote, with the main pro-Western opposition coalition on 37.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The result gives Georgian Dream 91 seats in the 150-member parliament – enough to govern but short of the supermajority it had sought to pass a constitutional ban on all main opposition parties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our victory is impressive," Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said in a statement, accusing the opposition of "undermining the country's constitutional order" by questioning his party's victory. (AFP)

    Iran mulls response as Israel says it hit Iran hard

  <img alt="Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says Israel's attack on Iran should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776444_1_20241027180156.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel's airstrikes "hit hard" Iran's defences and missile production, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, as Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the country was considering its response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With warfare raging in Gaza and Lebanon, direct confrontation between Israel and Iran risks spiralling into a regional conflagration. But a day after the airstrikes, there was no sign they would spark another round of escalation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, heavy fighting in Lebanon between Israeli forces and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which sharply intensified over recent weeks, continued on Sunday with an Israeli airstrike killing eight people in a residential block in Sidon, medics said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The air force attacked throughout Iran. We hit hard Iran's defence capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed at us," Netanyahu said in a speech, calling the attack "precise and powerful" and saying it met all its objectives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel’s army chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said the strike on Iran had showed what the Israeli response to its enemies would be.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We struck strategic systems in Iran, which carries great importance, and we will now see how things develop. We are prepared for all scenarios in every arena.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Islamic Republic has not signalled how it will respond to Saturday's long-anticipated strikes, which involved scores of fighter jets bombing targets near the capital Tehran and in the western provinces of Ilam and Khuzestan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The heavily armed arch-enemies have engaged in a cycle of retaliatory moves against each other for months, with Saturday's strike coming after an Iranian missile barrage on Oct 1, much of which Israel said was downed by its air defences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Khamenei said Israel's calculations "should be disrupted".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack on Iran, which killed four soldiers and caused some damage, "should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated", he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   ranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran was not looking for war but would give an "appropriate response".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US President Joe Biden called for a halt to escalation, which has raised fears of a wider Middle East war arising from the year-old Israeli-Hamas conflict in Gaza and Israel's thrust into south Lebanon to stop Hezbollah rocketing northern Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Iran was no longer able to use its allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon against Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The two groups "are no longer an effective tool" of Tehran, he said in a speech.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gallant added that Hamas was no longer functioning as a military network in Gaza and that Hezbollah's senior command and most of its missile capabilities had been eliminated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hamas has repeatedly said it is still able to function militarily, and Israel has recently conducted major new operations in devastated north Gaza against what it calls regrouping Hamas militants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah has said its command structure remains intact and that it retains significant missile capabilities. (Reuters)

  <img alt="Evo Morales is vying for the nomination of the ruling party in August 2025 presidential elections. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776469_1_20241028013441.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former Bolivian president Evo Morales said gunmen fired a hail of bullets at his car Sunday as he travelled to a radio interview in the central city of Cochabamba, wounding his driver.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The car in which I arrived has 14 bullet holes," said Morales, adding: "This was planned. The idea was to kill Evo."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The radio station that hosted the interview, Kawsachun Coca, released a video that it said was of the bullet-ridden pickup truck that Morales had been in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The windshield had three bullet holes and the driver had blood on his head.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales blamed the current president, Luis Arce, a former ally and cabinet minister of his with whom he has fallen out, for the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Lucho has destroyed Bolivia and now he wants to eliminate our process by killing Evo," Morales, using the president's nickname, said of his own attempt to regain the presidency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales, a former coca grower who is now 65, served as president from 2006 until 2019. He was highly popular in the Andean country until he tried to bypass the constitution to seek a fourth term.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was forced to resign after losing the support of the military following an election marked by allegations of fraud, and fled to Mexico.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales returned to Bolivia in 2020 seeking political resurrection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He and Arce are both vying for the nomination of the ruling MAS party in August 2025 presidential elections, although Morales is legally barred from running again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales is being investigated for rape, human trafficking and human smuggling over his alleged sexual relationship with a 15-year-old member of his political youth guard in 2015.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Supporters of Morales have protested by blocking major roads throughout the country for two weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, the government had criticised Morales for "destabilising" the country with two weeks of road blockades that have jammed up supplies of food and fuel around the country. It accused him of trying to "interrupt democratic order".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government in a statement also said some groups allied to Morales were armed and warned about violence, citing 14 police officers wounded trying to break up the blockades. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's ruling coalition may fall short of a parliamentary majority, exit polls for Sunday's general election showed, raising uncertainty over the make-up of the government of the world's fourth-largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll by national broadcaster NHK showed the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan for almost all of its post-war history, and junior coalition partner were set to win between 174 and 254 of the 465 seats in the lower house of Japan's parliament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan is predicted to win 128 to 191 seats. The outcome may force the LDP or CDPJ into power-sharing agreements with other parties to form a government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll by Nippon TV showed the ruling coalition would win 198 seats to the CDPJ's 157, both well short of the 233 seats needed to reach a majority, as voters punished Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's party over a funding scandal and inflation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a tough fight for the LDP," Shinjiro Koizumi, the LDP's election chief, told NHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba called the snap poll immediately after being elected to head the party last month, hoping to win a public mandate for his premiership. His predecessor Fumio Kishida quit after his support cratered due to anger over a cost of living crunch and a scandal involving unrecorded donations to lawmakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The uncertainty comes nine days before U.S. voters choose a new president and as Japan faces economic headwinds and increasingly tense relations with neighbouring China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP has held an outright majority since it returned to power in 2012 after a brief spell of CDPJ rule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Political wrangling could roil markets and be a headache for the Bank of Japan, if Ishiba chooses a partner that favours maintaining near-zero interest rates when the central bank wants to gradually raise them.
   <br/>

   Japanese shares fell 2.7% last week on the benchmark Nikkei index. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A truck driver rammed his vehicle into a crowd of people at a bus stop in central Israel on Sunday, injuring at least 24 people before he was "shot and neutralised", police said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Preliminary police findings showed the driver also hit a bus that had stopped at the same location to drop off passengers, the police said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least 24 people were injured in the incident, police said, without clarifying whether it was an attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The force however said civilians at the site of the incident "shot the truck driver and neutralised him".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier on Sunday the Magen David Adom emergency service said the incident occurred at Aharon Yariv Boulevard in Ramat HaSharon, north of the commercial hub Tel Aviv.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Of those injured, at least 16 people had been transported to nearby hospitals, MDA said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers and ambulances rushed to the scene, where Israeli television channels showed police cordoning off the area as medics helped the injured and a helicopter hovered above.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident comes as Israel holds ceremonies to mark the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the Hamas attack on October 7 last year that sparked the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mining giants BHP and Vale have signed a deal with Brazil's government to pay nearly US$30 billion in damages for a 2015 dam collapse that triggered the country's worst environmental disaster.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the signing of the deal over the November 5, 2015 collapse of a tailings dam at a mine in the southeastern town of Mariana, which triggered a giant mudslide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The river of mud swamped villages, rivers and rainforest, killing 19 people on its way to the sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope the mining companies have learned their lesson: it would have cost them less to prevent (the disaster), much less," Lula said at the ceremony attended by representatives of Brazil's Vale and Australia's BHP, co-owners of the Brazilian company Samarco that operated the iron mine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement, which Lula declared to be the biggest environmental payout in modern history, comes on the fifth day of a separate mega-trial in London over BHP's role in the dam's failure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than 620,000 complainants, including 46 Brazilian municipalities and several Indigenous communities, are seeking an estimated 36 billion pounds (US$47 million) in damages in the civil trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP denies responsibility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company said on Friday that the agreement reached in Brasilia did not end the lawsuits pending against the companies, nor prevent others being taken.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dam's failure released a torrent of over 40 million cubic meters of highly toxic sludge, the equivalent of 12,000 Olympic swimming pools, which coursed through the Doce River all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, over 600 kilometres away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 600 people were left homeless.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scientists say the mouth of the Doce River and parts of the southeast Atlantic coastline are still contaminated with metals from the spill, affecting the area's population of fish, birds, turtles, porpoises and whales.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP and Vale had already agreed in 2016 to pay 20 billion reais (about US$3.5 billion at today's rate) in damages, but the negotiations were reopened in 2021 due to what the government called their "non-compliance" and the slow progress of Brazil's justice system in resolving the dispute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Friday's agreement in Brazil, which is subject to approval by the country's Supreme Court, covers the companies' past and future obligations to assist people, communities and ecosystems affected by the disaster. (AFP)

    G7 meeting takes aim at Russian sanction breaches

  <img alt="In December 2022, the G7, the EU and Australia agreed to pressure purchasers of Russian oil not to breach a price ceiling in a bid to curb Russian petroleum sales and revenues. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776397_1_20241027071814.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Finance ministers of the G7 nations vowed on Saturday to step up efforts to prevent Russia from evading sanctions imposed over the war with Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We remain committed to taking further initiatives in response to oil price cap violations," the group said in a statement following a meeting in Washington. Those further steps were not spelled out in detail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In December 2022, the G7 together with the European Union and Australia agreed to pressure purchasers of Russian oil to not go above a certain price ceiling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement was intended to limit Russian petroleum sales and revenues without curbing exports so sharply that it would cause global oil prices to soar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But some countries have continued to import Russian crude oil without observing the price ceiling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7 finance ministers also said they would take additional measures aimed at "increasing the costs to Russia of using the shadow fleet to evade sanctions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials say Russia has used its fleet of shadow tankers, many of them old, unmarked and poorly maintained, to skirt sanctions by transporting oil without properly declaring their cargo or itineraries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tankers sometimes load or transfer their cargo at sea to avoid unwanted attention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States and the EU have sanctioned several of these ships and their owners, notably Russia's government-owned maritime company Sovcomflot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7 ministers said they intended "to intensify our efforts to prevent financial institutions from supporting Russia's evasion of our sanctions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, Russian financial institutions have developed a network of foreign subsidiaries to facilitate the purchase or sale of sanctioned goods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Joining the G7 ministers in the meeting on Saturday were the heads of the seven countries' central banks, plus top officials of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7, which groups seven of the world's most advanced economies, announced on Friday it had reached an agreement to provide a loan of around US$50 billion to Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The loan will be repaid not by Ukraine but with the interest -- roughly US$3 billion a year -- generated by Russian assets seized and frozen after the war began in February 2022. (AFP)

    Death toll from Trami approaches 100 in Philippines

  <img alt="Vast swathes of the Bicol region in the northern Philippines remain under water and many people are still missing or stranded. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776364_1_20241026201337.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rescuers in the Philippines raced on Saturday to reach people still stranded in areas made inaccessible by flooding from Tropical Storm Trami, which has killed at least 97 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami battered the main island of Luzon and forced nearly half a million people to flee their homes as heavy rain caused widespread floods and landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the hardest-hit Bicol region, residents trapped on the roofs and upper floors of their homes were still awaiting desperately needed assistance, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The floods have yet to subside. Calls asking for help are still pouring in," said Bicol regional police director Andre Dizon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We need to rescue them as soon as possible because starvation can be a problem. We're hearing reports that children are already getting sick."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the region's Camarines Sur province, food and drinking water were in increasingly short supply as some areas remained completely submerged and difficult to access, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Ferdinand Marcos visited the province on Saturday to inspect the damage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our main problem here is that many areas are still flooded," he told government officials during a briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have flood control systems but the amount of water is unmanageable. This is climate change. This is all new, so we have to come up with new solutions too," Marcos added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami's death toll rose on Saturday as rescuers retrieved more bodies from floodwaters and landslide sites, mostly from the Bicol region and Batangas province, south of Manila.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police have recorded 36 deaths in Bicol, most due to drowning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number of confirmed dead in Batangas has risen to 54, provincial police chief Jacinto Malinao said, with at least 21 people missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two were reported dead in separate incidents of electrocution and drowning in Cavite province, police said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Five more deaths have been confirmed in other provinces, bringing the total to 97, according to a tally based on official police and disaster agency sources.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Batangas, two hours south of the capital, rescuers were using backhoes and shovels to dig through mud as high as three metres in a desperate search for the missing in areas hit by landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cadaver-sniffing dogs have also been deployed to assist the operations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reporters who visited the province on Friday saw roads blocked by felled trees, vehicles half-submerged in mud and homes severely damaged by flash flooding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are still hoping for the best," said Malinao, the police chief.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will not stop until all bodies are retrieved."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The national disaster agency said on Saturday that about 495,000 people have been displaced by the flooding, which has submerged hundreds of villages in swathes of the northern Philippines. (AFP)

   A suicide bomber detonated at a checkpoint in western Pakistan on Saturday, killing eight people and wounding five more, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bomber set off the blast from the back of a motorbike rickshaw near the town of Mir Ali in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a local police officer said on condition of anonymity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four police officers were killed alongside two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians in the attack near the border with Afghanistan, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan has seen an increase in militancy since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in 2021, with Islamabad claiming hostile groups are now using the neighbouring country for shelter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Among the five injured personnel, the condition of three is critical, and they have been transferred to a local military hospital," the police officer said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A local government official who also did not want to be named confirmed the same toll of dead and wounded.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack was claimed by a little-known militant group calling itself "Aswad ul-Harb."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another checkpost near the Afghan border was raided this week by the Pakistani Taliban, killing 10 police officers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year, the country saw more suicide attacks than any year since 2014, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were 29 suicide attacks registered, killing 329 people in Pakistan's deadliest year in a decade. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   At least 50 people have been killed in a single attack by Sudanese paramilitaries who have besieged and raided villages in al-Jazira state, activists said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been at war with Sudan's regular army since April 2023 but have in recent days intensified their violence against civilians in al-Jazira, south of the capital Khartoum, after their commander in the state defected to the army.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The villages of al-Sariha and Azraq have been under attack" since Friday morning, the resistance committee in Hasaheisa, one of the hundreds of volunteer groups coordinating aid in Sudan, said in a statement late on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In al-Sariha alone, the attack killed 50 and wounded more than 200, the resistance committee added, reporting a total "inability to evacuate the wounded from the village due to the shelling and snipers" from the RSF.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a near-total communications blackout, tolls are impossible to verify and often hard to gather.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The resistance committee said that the nearby village of Azraq had been placed under a "total siege, suffering the same violations as al-Sariha," although it was not possible to provide a death toll.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the Sudanese doctors' union called on the United Nations to press for safe humanitarian corridors into villages that "are facing genocide at the hands of the Rapid Support militia."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The doctors' union added that rescue operations had become impossible and that "the army is incapable of protecting civilians."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to medical sources in several villages, nearly all health facilities capable of receiving emergency cases have been forced shut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates of 150,000 dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It has also caused what the UN calls the world's largest displacement crisis, with more than seven million uprooted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In June, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States ambassador to the UN, said Sudan is the planet's "largest humanitarian crisis."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Famine was declared in July in the Zamzam camp for displaced people near the town of El-Fasher, in Sudan's western Darfur region bordering Chad.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last Sunday the army announced that the RSF's al-Jazira commander Abu Aqla Kaykal had abandoned the paramilitaries, bringing "a large number of his forces" with him, in what it said was the first high-profile defection to its side.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Activists reported at least 20 people killed in subsequent paramilitary attacks in eastern al-Jazira. They also said an air strike by the Sudanese Armed forces on a mosque in the state capital, Wad Madani, killed 31 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, neighbouring Chad denied helping to arm the paramilitaries after the governor of Sudan's Darfur region, Minni Minnawi, accused them of doing so.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Chad has no interest in amplifying the war in Sudan," said Chadian Foreign Minister Abderaman Koulamallah, pointing out that Chad was "one of the rare countries upon which this war has had major repercussions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sudanese authorities have previously charged that Chad was facilitating the delivery of weapons from the United Arab Emirates to Sudan, which both Chad and the UAE have denied.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The International Monetary Fund's director for Africa, Catherine Pattillo, said this week that the war in Sudan was likely to cause heavy economic damage to its already struggling neighbours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "And then to be confronted with the refugees, the security issues, the trade issues, is very challenging for their growth," she said. (AFP)

  <img alt="King Charles had faced calls to apologise personally for Britain's role in the slave trade. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776357_1_20241026182212.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The 56-member Commonwealth agreed the "time has come" for discussions about the legacy of the "abhorrent" transatlantic slave trade on Saturday, in a landmark joint statement that raised the prospect of future reparations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gathering for a summit in Samoa, leaders held lengthy and occasionally tense talks over one of the most sensitive aspects of their shared and troubled past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bloc brings together Britain and most of its former colonies, many of which are still scarred by the brutal trade that saw an estimated 10-15 million slaves ripped from Africa over four centuries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   African, Caribbean and Pacific nations have pressed for Britain – and other European powers – to pay financial compensation for slavery, or to make political amends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a closing statement, Commonwealth leaders noted calls for "reparatory justice" for the "abhorrent" transatlantic trade and agreed that "the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Britain and other colonial powers have occasionally apologised for slavery in broad terms, they have baulked at the idea of paying financial reparations, which could come with a hefty price tag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the summit, London tried to avoid making explicit commitments, while trying to prove the Commonwealth was still relevant and could work together.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The meeting's conclusion was delayed for hours as leaders and officials tried to hammer out a compromise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That compromise text may stop short of what some former colonies wanted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The time has come to have a real dialogue about how we address these historical wrongs," Prime Minister Philip Davis of the Bahamas told the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The horrors of slavery left a deep, generational wound in our communities, and the fight for justice and reparatory justice is far from over."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But experts said the summit could be historic nonetheless.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The commitment to conversations on reparatory justice wedges open the door for dialogue," said Kingsley Abbott, of the University of London's Institute of Commonwealth Studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Commonwealth" he said, "should see this as an opportunity to lead on a potentially historic process, and to do so with vision and courage."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Britain – still staking out its place in the world after empire and leaving the European Union – the summit had high stakes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the delegates were Prime Minister Keir Starmer and King Charles, his first summit as monarch and as head of the Commonwealth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The British royal, whose family benefited from the slave trade over centuries, had faced calls to apologise personally.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stopped well short of that on Friday, asking delegates to "reject the language of division."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I understand, from listening to people across the Commonwealth, how the most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "None of us can change the past. But we can commit, with all our hearts, to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right inequalities that endure."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Charles left to return to London before the final summit communique had been agreed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Commonwealth leaders found more common cause on the "existential" issue of climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They agreed to an "Ocean Declaration," which recognises national maritime boundaries even if sea levels continue to rise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They also agreed to protect at least 30 percent of the ocean and to restore at least 30 percent of degraded marine ecosystems by 2030.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What the ocean declaration seems to do and to say is that once your marine boundaries are fixed, they are fixed in perpetuity," said outgoing Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Patricia Scotland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Commonwealth leaders also agreed to name Ghana's foreign minister Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey as the new secretary general.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A former lawmaker, she has served as foreign minister for the past seven years, notably steering Ghana's two-year tenure on the UN Security Council, ending December 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She has backed the drafting of a free trade agreement among Commonwealth member states and has previously said she stands for reparations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Truly humbled by the overwhelming support of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in selecting me as the incoming Secretary-General of the Commonwealth" she posted on social media.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The work indeed lies ahead!" (AFP)

  <img alt="Shigeru Ishiba could become Japan's shortest-serving prime minister in the post-war period.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Candidates in Japan's super-tight election made last-ditch appeals to voters on Saturday, with opinion polls suggesting the ruling coalition might fall short of a majority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Such a bombshell outcome in Sunday's vote would be the worst result for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) since 2009, and potentially a knockout blow to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba – a fan of trains, 1970s pop idols and making model ships and planes – only last month took the helm of the LDP, which has governed Japan for almost all of the past seven decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a tough internal contest, the 67-year-old former defence minister became premier on October 1. Days later, he called the snap parliamentary elections, promising a "new Japan."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba pledged to revitalise depressed rural regions and to address the "quiet emergency" of Japan's falling population through family-friendly policies such as flexible working hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he has since rowed back his position on issues including allowing married couples to take separate surnames.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also named only two women ministers in his cabinet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rising prices have rankled voters, and also dogging Ishiba is the fallout from a party slush fund scandal that helped sink his predecessor, Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll on Friday by the Yomiuri Shimbun daily suggested that the LDP and its coalition partner Komeito might struggle to get the 233 lower house seats needed for a majority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba has set this threshold as his objective, and missing it would undermine his position in the LDP and mean finding other coalition partners or leading a minority government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Local media speculated that Ishiba could potentially even resign immediately to take responsibility, becoming Japan's shortest-serving prime minister in the post-war period. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel announced the launch of "precise strikes" on military targets in Iran on Saturday, in retaliation for attacks against it, as Iranian state media reported several explosions around the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel - right now the Israel Defense Forces (Israeli military) is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran," the military said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel had vowed, following Iran's October 1 missile attack, to hit back.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hostilities between Iran and Israel soared since Israel launched it's offensive in Gaza last October, which has so far killed over 42,000 Palestinians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel has since broadened the scope of its operations to Lebanon, vowing to secure its northern border after nearly a year of cross-border attacks by Lebanese group Hezbollah.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilised," the Israeli military said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Military spokesman Daniel Hagari in a separate statement called on the people to be "alert and vigilant".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian state television said on Saturday "strong explosions" were heard around the capital, though it did not specify the cause of the blasts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Minutes ago, the sound of strong explosions were heard from around Tehran, the source of these sounds is not yet clear," a state TV presenter said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian media said no fire or explosions had been reported at a main oil refinery near Tehran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States said strikes by its ally Israel on military targets in Iran are "an exercise of self-defence" following the attack earlier this month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a possible indication of the scope of Saturday's strike, Syrian state news agency SANA said Syrian air defences had intercepted what it described as "hostile targets" near the capital city, Damascus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our anti-aircraft defence is confronting hostile targets in the skies around Damascus," SANA said on Telegram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also reported "sounds of explosions" in the vicinity of Damascus, though the origin of those blasts was unclear. (AFP)

  <img alt='Kevin Jordan, (centre), called the decision "extremely disappointing."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A man whose home had to be demolished because of coastal erosion lost a landmark legal claim on Friday against the UK government that accused it of failing to meet obligations to protect citizens from the effects of climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kevin Jordan, whose seaside home on the Norfolk coast in eastern England had to be knocked down, was one of two private claimants who brought the case, along with environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Co-claimant Doug Paulley, a disability activist, lives in a care home in northern England and says hotter summers affect his health and puts him at increased risk of serious harm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They both claimed the government's climate adaptation aims policy, drawn up by the previous Conservative government, failed to comply with the country's 2008 Climate Change Act.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The claim also said the policy failed to assess impacts on protected groups under equality law and that it breached the human rights of the two individual claimants due to the lack of provision for the specific risks they faced.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a judge at the High Court in London ruled on Friday that the government's plans were lawful – a decision described by Jordan as "extremely disappointing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Friends of the Earth said its legal team will "study the detail of this judgement before we decide whether to lodge an appeal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A robust and comprehensive adaptation plan is urgently needed to help protect us from increasingly severe storms, floods and heatwaves – particularly marginalised groups, such as older and disabled people, and those living in areas most at risk from climate change," it added, urging the new Labour government to act.

    Putin: It's our affair if Russia uses N Korean troops

  <img alt="Vladimir Putin has not denied US claims that North Korea had sent troops to Russia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776213_2_20241025205551.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that it was Russia's business whether or not it decided to use North Korean troops, and that if Ukraine wanted to join Nato then Moscow could do what it wanted to ensure its own security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States said on Wednesday that it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine, a move that the West is casting as a significant escalation of the Ukraine war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ukraine's military intelligence service said that the first North Korean units trained in Russia had been deployed in the Kursk region, a Russian border area where Ukrainian forces took a chunk of Russian land in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we have to decide something, we will decide... but it is our sovereign decision whether we will apply it, whether we will not, whether we need it," Putin told Russian state television. "This is our business."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin said that the West repeatedly said that it was up to Ukraine how it ensured its security – "with or without Nato".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The sooner they realise the futility of such an approach in relations with Russia, the better it will be for everyone, and perhaps, above all, for themselves," Putin said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday said Russia could send North Korean troops into battle as early as Sunday and urged international pressure on the Kremlin and Pyongyang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "According to intelligence reports, on October 27-28, Russia will use the first North Korean military in combat zones," the Ukrainian leader said on social media, calling for "tangible pressure" to be placed on Russia and North Korea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement during Putin's visit to Pyongyang in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Article 4 of the agreement says: "If one of the parties is subjected to an armed attack by any state or several states and thus finds itself in a state of war, the other party will immediately provide military and other assistance with all means at its disposal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin on Thursday did not deny US claims that North Korea had sent troops to Russia but said it is up to Moscow how to run its mutual defence clause with Pyongyang and accused the West of escalating the Ukraine war. (Reuters/AFP)

    Trami leaves towns submerged, 66 dead in Philippines

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Philippine rescue workers battled floodwaters on Friday to reach residents still trapped on the roofs of their homes as Tropical Storm Trami moved out to sea after killing at least 66 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tens of thousands remained displaced after fleeing floods driven by a torrential downpour that dumped two months' worth of rainfall in just two days in some areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Many are still trapped on the roofs of their homes and asking for help," Andre Dizon, police director for the hard-hit Bicol region, said. "We are hoping that the floods will subside today, since the rain has stopped."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Accessibility remained a major issue for rescuers on Friday, particularly in Bicol, President Ferdinand Marcos said at a press briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There were landslides in areas that didn't have landslides before... so I guess the soil is completely saturated, the water has nowhere to go," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The cities of Naga and Legazpi were reporting "many casualties but we haven't been able to get in yet," Marcos added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As Trami departed the Philippines in the early hours, the storm's death toll swelled as fresh reports of victims emerged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Batangas province south of the capital Manila, police staff sergeant Nelson Cabuso said six unidentified bodies had been found in Sampaloc village.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The area was hit by a flash flood yesterday. Our people are still in the area to check if there are other casualties," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number of confirmed dead in the province stood at at least 34.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Manila was seemingly spared the kind of heavy flooding that accompanied Typhoon Gaemi in July, a subdivision south of the capital was seen to be largely submerged. (AFP)

  <img alt="The continuing fallout from a slush fund scandal that angered voters is adding to Shigeru Ishiba's woes. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776169_1_20241025145940.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba hit out at "biased" media reports related to a party scandal, as a fresh survey suggested that his ruling coalition could fall short of a majority in elections on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This would be the worst result for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) – which has governed Japan for almost all of the past seven decades – since it last lost power from 2009 to 2012, as well as a major blow to Ishiba himself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Adding to Ishiba's woes is the continuing fallout from a slush fund scandal within the LDP that angered voters and helped torpedo his predecessor, Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba promised to not actively support LDP politicians caught up in the scandal running in the election, although they are still standing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But according to media reports, the party has still provided US$132,000 each to district offices headed by these figures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is truly frustrating that such reports come out at a time like this," Ishiba said in a campaign speech on Thursday. "Those candidates will not use the money."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We cannot be defeated by those with biased views," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Opposition leaders pounced on Ishiba's comments, including Yoshihiko Noda, a popular former prime minister who heads the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), the second-biggest in parliament.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pope Francis urged the world's 1.4 billion Catholics to abandon the "mad pursuit" of money and instead devote themselves to their faith in a new encyclical letter, the highest form of papal teaching, released on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Francis' fourth encyclical over his 11-year papacy largely abstains from talking about political issues, a departure from his earlier writings, which also addressed themes such as global climate change and "trickle-down" economic policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Dilexit nos" (He loved us) instead encourages believers to strengthen their religious lives. The world is living in an "age of superficiality," the pope says, and Catholics and other Christians "need to rediscover the importance of the heart".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In a world where everything is bought and sold, people's sense of their worth appears increasingly to depend on what they can accumulate with the power of money," Francis writes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The love of Christ has no place in this perverse mechanism, yet only that love can set us free from a mad pursuit that no longer has room for a gratuitous love," says the pontiff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 142-page text focuses on spiritual themes, rather than calls for concrete political action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pope's 2015 letter "Laudato Si'" (Praise Be) urged the world to care for the environment and has been credited by some world leaders with influencing discussions ahead of the 2016 Paris Agreement. His 2020 letter "Fratelli Tutti" (Brothers All) called for a reconsideration of economic policies in the aftermath of the global coronavirus pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new letter instead offers reflections on a Catholic spiritual practice promoted by a 17th century French nun. Sr. Margaret Mary Alacoque, who reportedly experienced several visions of Jesus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Christians should emulate Jesus' love by also caring for those in need, the pope says. "There is no greater way for us to return love for love," he states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Release of the papal document comes as Francis is leading a month-long summit of global Catholic leaders at the Vatican, which is expected to release its own text on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Discussions around most of the divisive issues originally part of the summit's considerations, such as the possibility of letting women be ordained as Catholic clergy, have now been put on hold. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   At least 1.1 million people on India's eastern coast hunkered down in storm shelters ahead of a powerful cyclone set to hammer the low-lying region early Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cyclone Dana is likely to hit the coasts of West Bengal and Odisha states -- home to around 150 million people -- as a "severe cyclonic storm", India's weather bureau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It predicts winds gusting up to 120 kilometres per hour to cause "major damage" to thatch-roofed houses, which are common on the coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Downpours began lashing areas of neighbouring West Bengal state, prompting officials there to be on high alert, while Odisha already saw strong winds and rain on Thursday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have closed schools, cancelled more than 200 trains, suspended flights and warned fishermen not to venture out to sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India's navy said two ships were "standing by with supplies and rescue and diving teams".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The eye of the storm is predicted to make landfall early Friday, near the coal-exporting port of Dhamra.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Government disaster response teams drove the streets, broadcasting warnings from loudspeakers urging people to take shelter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Crashing waves are expected to inundate swathes of coastal areas, with water predicted to surge up to two metres above usual tide levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India’s eastern coasts have long been prone to cyclones, but the number of intense storms is increasing along the country’s coast, with global warming driven by planet-heating gases causing them to become more extreme and unpredictable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year was India’s deadliest cyclone season in recent years, killing 523 people and costing an estimated US$2.5 billion in damage. (AP/AFP)

    Jailed British nurse Lucy Letby loses appeal

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former British nurse and convicted child serial killer Lucy Letby on Thursday lost an attempt to appeal against her conviction for trying to murder a newborn baby, amid questions over the fairness of her trials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby, 34, was found guilty of murdering seven children and attempting to murder seven more between June 2015 and June 2016 while working in the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital in Chester, northern England, making her Britain's worst serial child killer of modern times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was convicted of an eighth count of attempted murder at a retrial earlier this year, after the original jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge that Letby tried to kill a baby girl by removing her breathing tube.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prosecutor Nick Johnson told Manchester Crown Court that, little more than an hour after the child was born, a senior doctor found the baby's breathing tube dislodged and Letby standing there "doing nothing".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby's lawyer Benjamin Myers told London's Court of Appeal on Thursday that Letby "maintains and has maintained she is not guilty of the offences".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He argued that the retrial was an abuse of process as Letby could not have a fair trial because of extensive coverage of her convictions, which featured "intense hostility towards her" and comments made by the Crown Prosecution Service and police.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There was no way in which the jury in trial two were going to have the publicity and the comment and the hostility ameliorated," Myers said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge William Davis refused Letby's application for leave to appeal against the conviction from her retrial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby attended the hearing by videolink from prison and sat impassively as the judge stated the court's reasons for refusing her application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The outcome of the first trial undoubtedly led to an unusually large amount of publicity and online debate," Davis said. "That is because, on its face, the case was extraordinary."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby's attempt to overturn her convictions from the first trial was refused in May. She can now only challenge those convictions if the Criminal Cases Review Commission refer those cases back to the Court of Appeal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since her trials, Letby's conviction has come under a spotlight, following criticism by some experts of medical and statistical evidence presented by the prosecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some media have questioned whether she might be the victim of a miscarriage of justice, while a public inquiry into her crimes continues.  (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping on Thursday told the Brics summit in the Russian city of Kazan that world peace and development are still facing formidable challenges and urged the group to be a "stabiliser" to ensure global security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Addressing other leaders of Brics nations on the final day of the summit, Xi noted that China is doing what it can to prevent the conflict in the Middle East from spreading.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will continue to advance the ceasefire efforts in Gaza and to start new initiatives to make sure that the war will not extend to Lebanon," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also said that the "common march of the Global South towards modernity is a major event in world history".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to show collective wisdom and strength to make our contribution and show the responsibilities to build a community of shared future for mankind. We have to uphold peace and achieve common security," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be the stabiliser to ensure security and also to continue our efforts to solve problems to ensure global security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brics grew out of meetings between China, Russia, and India, who then began to meet more formally, eventually adding Brazil, then South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. (Additional reporting by AFP, Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tropical Storm Trami has killed at least 26 people and forced more than 150,000 to flee their homes in the Philippines, officials said on Thursday, as it made landfall on the northeastern coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, locally known as severe tropical storm Kristine, dumped heavy to torrential rain on the main island of Luzon, triggering widespread flooding and landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With maximum sustained winds of 95 kph (59 mph), the storm was moving westward across the mountainous northern region of Cordillera towards the South China Sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters warned of heavy to intense rainfall, flooding, landslides and storm surges for some northern provinces.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the deaths from the storm over the past few days were due to drowning and landslides in the central Bicol region, including Naga city where 14 were reported dead on Thursday, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami made landfall in the northeastern town of Divilacan in Isabela province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government ordered businesses and schools in the path of the storm to close in anticipation of heavy rain and floods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 163,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centres, the civil defence office said, most of whom were in Bicol as residents fled their homes after floodwaters reached as high as the roofs of bungalow houses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, a powerful cyclone is expected to barrel into India's eastern coast early on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dana is expected to cross the coasts of the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal between midnight Thursday and Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The states expect to evacuate around 300,000 people each, and Odisha has already moved 50,000 people to relief shelters. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korea "won't sit idle" over the North's deployment of thousands of troops to help Russia fight Ukraine, President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Thursday, slamming it as a "provocation".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency has claimed that about 3,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia training, likely to deploy to the frontlines against Ukraine soon, with thousands more troops to be sent by December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato and Washington have confirmed that Pyongyang's soldiers are now training in Russia, warning that if they were to join the fight against Kyiv, it could mark a dangerous escalation of the grinding war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "South Korea won't sit idle over this," Yoon said after talks with visiting Polish President Andrzej Duda, adding that the two countries agreed North Korea's deployment was "a provocation that threatens global security beyond the Korean Peninsula and Europe".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Poland's Duda spoke to Yoon on Thursday, after which the two leaders "strongly condemned North Korea's nuclear and missile development and provocations“.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korea has previously denied deploying forces to Russia, while Moscow has not confirmed it, but has defended its military cooperation with Pyongyang. (AFP)

  <img alt="The strike has halted activity at two Seattle-area factories that assemble the Boeing 737 MAX and 777. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776000_1_20241024133808.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Boeing workers in the Seattle region decisively rejected the US aerospace giant's latest contract offer on Wednesday, extending their nearly six-week strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Almost two-thirds – 64 percent – of the members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 rejected the contract, the union said on social media platform X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest Boeing offer had included a 35 percent wage hike, but did not reinstate a pension plan sought by many employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 33,000 hourly workers with the IAM have been on the picket line since September 13, when workers overwhelmingly rejected a Boeing proposal for a new four-year contract to replace the expiring pact.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike has halted activity at two Seattle-area factories that assemble the 737 MAX and 777.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Workers had sought a 40 percent wage increase to make up for years of tepid salary growth that have not kept pace with inflation and that employees complain leave them unable to afford living in one of the most costly regions of the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After 10 years of sacrifices, we still have ground to make up, and we're hopeful to do so by resuming negotiations promptly," Jon Holden, president of the Seattle union, said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is workplace democracy – and also clear evidence that there are consequences when a company mistreats its workers year after year," Holden said.
   <br/>

   "Ten years of holding workers back unfortunately cannot be undone quickly or easily, but we will continue to negotiate in good faith until we have made gains that workers feel adequately make up for what the company took from them in the past," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A Boeing spokeswoman said Wednesday night the company had no comment on the vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extension of the strike adds to the troubles facing Boeing and its new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who earlier Wednesday expressed measured optimism the latest contract would be ratified. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping has urged China and India to strengthen communication and cooperation during talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Kazan, Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first bilateral meeting in five years between the two leaders on Wednesday came days after the countries reached a deal on their contested border.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi said the two sides should resolve conflicts and differences and realise each other's development dreams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   State media also quoted the president as saying China and India should "shoulder international responsibilities, set an example for developing countries to seek strength through unity, and contribute to a multi-polar world and democratisation of international relations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Modi, for his part, said mutual trust will guide ties with China, welcoming the consensus over the border issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "India-China relations are important for the people of our countries, and for regional and global peace and stability," Modi said on X. "Mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity will guide bilateral relations."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi and Modi last held formal bilateral talks in October 2019 in the southern Indian town of Mamallapuram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The president also met other leaders on the sidelines of the Brics summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his meeting with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, Xi said an early ceasefire and ending the war in Gaza are key to easing regional tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And in talks with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Xi said Beijing stands ready to work with Cairo to push for an early end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and ease tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also welcomed Egypt's participation in the Brics summit for the first time as a full member.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World leaders called for peace in the Middle East and Ukraine at the summit meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin said he welcomed offers to mediate in the Ukraine conflict.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin also said the summit's agenda covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, as well as settling regional conflicts and moving to expand the Bric group of countries. (Agencies)

    Turkey strikes Kurdish militants after deadly attack

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Turkey said it launched strikes on Kurdish militants in Iraq and Syria on Wednesday after blaming them for an attack that killed five people at a defence firm near Ankara.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A further 22 people were wounded in the attack, which the government said was "very likely" carried out by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hours later, "an air operation was carried out against terrorist targets in the north of Iraq and Syria," the defence ministry said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A total of 32 targets belonging to the terrorists were successfully destroyed," it said, adding that operations were continuing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Listed as a terror group by Turkey and its Western allies, the PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. It has a number of bases in Kurdish regions of Iraq and Syria.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the attack that sparked the strikes, a huge explosion rocked the headquarters of state-run Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) some 40 kilometres north of Ankara shortly after 3:30 pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It sent clouds of smoke into the air as the sound of gunfire rang out, Turkish media reported, with the incident quickly denounced by Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya as a "terror attack."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was in Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin, called it a "heinous" attack on Turkey's defence industry "targeting the survival of our country," in a message on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yerlikaya said three of the injured were in critical condition and that the two attackers, "a woman and a man," had been "neutralised."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no immediate claim for the attack but Yerlikaya said: "The way in which this action was carried out is very probably linked to the PKK."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said efforts to identify the perpetrators of the attack were ongoing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Defence Minister Yasar Guler also pointed the finger at "PKK villains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As they always do, they tried to disturb our nation's peace through a despicable and dishonourable attack... we will make them suffer for what they have done," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkey's vice president Cevdet Yilmaz said four of the victims were TAI employees while the fifth was a taxi driver. Media reports earlier said the assailants had killed him and taken his taxi to carry out the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An unconfirmed report by private channel NTV said a "group of terrorists" had burst into the building, one of whom "blew himself up" while other outlets reported exchanges of fire for more than an hour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haberturk TV said there was a "hostage situation," with another media pundit saying "a number of hostages" had been rescued.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkish authorities imposed a blackout of live images from the scene.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabah newspaper published what it said was a CCTV image from the entrance showing a black-clad young man with a moustache carrying a rucksack and what appeared to be an assault rifle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As night fell, dozens of ambulances could be seen waiting in convoy near the site, their blue lights flashing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of Turkey's top defence firms and a major arms producer, TAI employs 15,500 people and has a vast production site covering an area of five million square metres, its website says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack drew condemnation from across Turkey and beyond, with Putin offering Erdogan his "condolences in connection with the terror attack" at the start of their meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Statements of condemnation and condolences to the families of the victims also poured in from Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Tehran and Washington and Nato leadership.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack came as Turkey's political establishment appeared to be leaning towards a political, negotiated solution to the decades-long conflict with the Kurdish militants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The timing was not lost on the main pro-Kurdish party, Dem, the third largest force in parliament, which said it was "noteworthy that the attack took place just as Turkish society was talking about a solution and the possibility of dialogue."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It took place a day after the head of the far-right MHP, which belongs to Erdogan's ruling coalition, invited jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to address parliament to announce his movement's dissolution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984, claiming tens of thousands of lives, with Ocalan held in solitary confinement on a prison island since 1999. (AFP)

    Pelicot trial calls for rape law changes in France

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   France may introduce changes to its rape law to include consent for the first time, after a mass rape trial shook the country, challenging the limits of existing legislation and prompting some leading politicians to call for change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dominique Pelicot has admitted to drugging his wife and recruiting dozens of men online to rape her while she was unconscious and 50 men are facing trial alongside him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They are accused of taking turns on the drugged and inert body of Gisèle Pelicot while her husband recorded the horror for his swelling private video library.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite video evidence against them, at least 35 of the defendants have denied the rape charges, claiming that Dominique Pelicot tricked them into believing they were taking part in a sex game, or that Gisele Pelicot was feigning sleep.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dominique Pelicot denied this, telling the court his co-defendants knew exactly what the situation was.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case has prompted deep soul-searching in France, with consent at the heart of the matter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am determined that things change in this society," Gisele Pelicot told the Avignon court on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gisele Pelicot insisted from the start that the trial should be open to the public, and has encouraged other women who have been sexually assaulted to come forward.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wanted all women who are rape victims to say to themselves 'Mrs Pelicot did it, so we can do it too'," she said. "It's not us who should feel shame, but them (the perpetrators).”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   France’s new Justice Minister Didier Migaud recently said he is in favour of updating the law, as has President Emmanuel Macron, after France blocked the inclusion of a consent-based rape definition in a European directive in 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I believe it is beyond understanding for our fellow citizens to refuse to include consent in the definition of rape," Migaud told lawmakers earlier this month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 2023 survey by one of France's main polling institutes, IFOP, found that nine out of 10 people polled wanted France to support the EU directive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Consent-based rape law already exists in Sweden, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and more than a dozen other European countries, with the rise of the feminist #MeToo movement prompting legislative reform in some jurisdictions since 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, French criminal law defines rape as a penetrative act or oral sex act committed on someone using "violence, coercion, threat or surprise." It makes no clear mention of the need for a partner's consent and prosecutors must prove the intention to rape to secure a guilty verdict, five legal experts said. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping on Wednesday called on member countries to build Brics for peace and act as guardians of common security in an address at their summit in Kazan, Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also spoke about three principles to help defuse the Ukraine crisis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his speech, the president urged Brics countries to advocate peaceful co-existence and harmony between civilizations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said Brics members should support sustainable development, and that China is willing to leverage its advantages to expand cooperation with the bloc in green industries, clean energy and green minerals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Ukraine, Xi urged Brics nations to uphold the three principles of no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party, with an aim towards de-escalating the crisis as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin has welcomed offers by Brics leaders to mediate in the conflict, his spokesman said Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many countries "expressed a desire to contribute more actively" to resolving the conflict, state media cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters on the sidelines of the summit. (Xinhua & agencies)

    Tokyo Metro shares rocket higher on debut

  <img alt="Proceeds from the Tokyo Metro IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775777_1_20241023103553.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tokyo Metro shares soared more than 40 percent on their debut on Wednesday after its government owners raised US$2.3 billion in Japan's biggest initial public offering since 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In early trade Tokyo Metro shares were at 1,745 yen (US$11.5), up 45 percent from their issue price of 1,200 yen, with reports saying the issue was 15 times oversubscribed among investors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Proceeds from the IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan that killed 18,000 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The listing reduces government ownership, split between the country and Tokyo city, to around 50 percent. Many Japanese rail operators are already privatised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To attract investors, perks for buying more than 200 shares included tickets to the Tokyo Metro museum and golf range, as well as free tempura toppings at its noodle stands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The IPO is Japan's largest since tycoon Masayoshi Son's tech and telecoms conglomerate SoftBank Group raised a national record of US$23.5 billion by listing its mobile unit in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   London built the first public underground railway, but in 1927 Tokyo became the first Asian city with a subway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each day around 6.5 million people ride the Metro's nine lines, which are part of a vast transport network serving the capital and its sprawling suburbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four other subway lines are run separately by the Tokyo government, alongside private services and East Japan Railway's overground routes such as the Yamanote Line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The network's cleanliness and efficiency contrasts with the often creaking infrastructure of other big cities like London, Paris and New York, where many operators are deep in debt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tokyo Metro posted a net profit of 46.3 billion yen for the fiscal year that ended in March 2024, up 67 percent from a year earlier. This year it is aiming to increase this to 52.3 billion yen. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a big US push for a ceasefire in Gaza, met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday after Washington called for an end to the war in Lebanon "as soon as possible".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken began his meetings in Israel as Hezbollah launched rockets into Tel Aviv and Haifa, and Israeli air strikes pummelled parts of Beirut's southern suburbs, including an air strike that caused a multi-storey building to entirely collapse and sent a fresh wave of panicked residents fleeing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His meetings with Netanyahu and other top officials also come as Israel weighs its response to Iran's October 1 missile attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Diplomatic efforts have so far failed to bring an end to both the year-long war in the Palestinian territory Gaza and to its spillover conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah said on Tuesday there would be no negotiations while fighting continues, and claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Netanyahu's holiday home on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington hopes the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar – Israel’s most wanted man, blamed for triggering the year of warfare by planning the deadly attacks on October 7 last year on Israel territory – will provide a new opportunity for peace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Israel has so far shown no sign of relenting in its military campaigns even after assassinating several leaders of Iran's allies Hamas and Hezbollah, which lost its powerful secretary-general Sayed Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken's week-long trip to the Middle East will also take him to Jordan and Qatar. US officials say he is focusing on plans for rebuilding and governing Gaza after the war, necessary for reaching a ceasefire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington has long said it ideally wants Gaza reunited with the West Bank under a government run by the Palestinian Authority, which now exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli occupied West Bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken also plans to speak to Israeli leaders about the expected strike on Iran and discourage any move that could massively escalate regional conflict, an official on the plane with him said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Gaza war began after Hamas-led fighters attacked Israeli communities on October 7 last year, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed 42,718 Palestinians, Gaza health authorities say. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping and other world leaders have arrived in the Russian city of Kazan for the Brics summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi was greeted at the airport by Russian officials upon his arrival on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He later met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hailed ties between the two countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, and the international situation is chaotic and intertwined," Xi told Putin, praising the "profound friendship" between Beijing and Moscow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ties have "injected strong impetus into the development, revitalisation and modernisation of the two countries" and have "made important contributions to upholding international equity and justice," Xi said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the two sides "have found the right way for neighbouring major countries to get along with each other which features non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party," according to Xinhua News Agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa are among the leaders joining the Brics gathering in Kazan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is also undertaking his first trip to Russia since April 2022 to attend the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov touted the summit as the largest foreign-policy event ever held by Russia, with 36 countries attending and more than 20 of them represented by heads of state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Putin, the three-day meeting also offers a powerful way to demonstrate the failure of US-led efforts to isolate Moscow over the war in Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Brics alliance, which initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has expanded rapidly to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and a few others have expressed an interest in joining. (Agencies)

  <img alt="North Korean state media have not commented on Pyongyang's purported troop deployment to Russia. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775650_1_20241022150649.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   North Korea has not sent troops to Russia to help Moscow fight Ukraine, one of its United Nations representatives said on Monday, dismissing Seoul's claims as a "groundless rumour".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency had said that Pyongyang sent a "large-scale" troop deployment to help its ally, claiming that 1,500 special forces were already training in Russia's Far East and ready to head soon for the frontlines of the Ukraine war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for the so-called military cooperation with Russia, my delegation does not feel any need for comment on such groundless stereotyped rumours," a North Korean representative said at a committee meeting during the UN General Assembly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's claims were "aimed at smearing the image of the DPRK and undermining the legitimate, friendly and cooperative relations between two sovereign states," the representative told the meeting, held late on Monday in New York.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korean state media have not commented on the purported troop deployment, and Russia has also not confirmed the troop deployment, but defended its military cooperation with the North.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After Seoul summoned Moscow's ambassador in South Korea to complain, the envoy "stressed that cooperation between Russia and North Korea... is not directed against the interests of South Korea's security".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Neither Nato nor the United States have confirmed the deployment, but both have cast it as a potentially dangerous escalation in the long-running Ukraine conflict.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have seen reports the DPRK has sent forces and is preparing to send additional soldiers to Ukraine to fight alongside Russia," Robert Wood, US ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If true, this marks a dangerous and highly concerning development and an obvious deepening of the DPRK-Russia military relationship," Wood said. (AFP)

    Hurricane Oscar leaves six dead in Cuba

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hurricane Oscar left six people dead after hitting Cuba over the weekend during a major power blackout, authorities said on Monday, as electricity was restored to most of the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lights went out for the country's 10 million people on Friday after the collapse of the nation's largest power plant crippled the whole grid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   By Monday afternoon, nearly 90 percent of customers in Havana – home to some two million people – had power again, the capital's electricity company said in a report published by state-run news portal Cubadebate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course I'm happy!" Olga Gomez, a 59-year-old housewife in Havana, said after the lights came back on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have an elderly senile mother of 85 and an autistic son. It's very difficult when there's no power," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many residents outside Havana, however, remained without electricity, according to the authorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba was still bathed in darkness on Sunday when Hurricane Oscar made landfall in the eastern part of the country as a Category 1 storm, causing several deaths and damage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Regrettably, according to preliminary information, six lives have been lost," President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a televised remarks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The storm caused severe damage in the eastern province of Guantanamo, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oscar weakened into a tropical storm as it moved inland but was still expected to bring "significant, life-threatening flash flooding along with mudslides," the US National Hurricane Center warned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Roofs and the walls of houses were damaged, and electricity poles and trees felled, state television reported. (AFP)

    UN resolution basis for Lebanon ceasefire 'not enough'

  <img alt='US special envoy Amos Hochstein has called for additional measures to ensure UN resolution 1701 was implemented "fairly, accurately and transparently". Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775538_1_20241021212807.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US special envoy Amos Hochstein said on Monday that the United States was working on a formula to end the conflict between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah for good, and that merely committing to a previous UN resolution would not be enough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 states that only the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers should be deployed in southern Lebanon, while demanding the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It may have ended the last round of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in 2006, but the Iranian-backed Shi'ite movement did not end its presence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Attention has focused on the resolution again during the latest Israel-Hezbollah war that erupted last month after nearly a year of cross-border fire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hochstein, visiting Lebanon for the second time in two months, was holding talks with Lebanese officials in a new US mediation push to bring peace to the Middle East after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Both sides simply committing to (UN resolution) 1701 is not enough," Hochstein told a press conference in the capital Beirut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the resolution remained as a basis for ending the conflict, additional measures were needed to ensure it was implemented "fairly, accurately and transparently".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are working with government of Lebanon, the state of Lebanon, as well as the government of Israel to get to a formula that brings an end to this conflict once and for all," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's assault on Hezbollah has raised fears of a wider regional conflict between Israel and Hezbollah's patron, Iran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After what he called a "very constructive" meeting with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a close ally of Hezbollah who has been engaging in diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, Hochstein said:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The United States wants to end this conflict absolutely as soon as possible. That is what President Biden wants, that is what we all are working towards." (Reuters/AFP)

    Moldova votes in favour of EU membership

  <img alt="The “No” vote in favour of Moldova's EU membership appeared to be ahead until the last few thousand votes were counted. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775551_1_20241022004607.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Moldovans voted, by a razor-thin majority, in favour of securing the country’s path toward European Union membership by 2030, electoral data showed on Monday, after the pro-Western president accused “criminal groups” of trying to undermine the vote in the former Soviet republic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The “No” vote appeared to be ahead until the last few thousand votes were counted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With 99.41 percent of votes counted in the EU referendum held Sunday, the “Yes” vote stood at 50.39 percent and the “No” vote at 49.61 percent, according to the Central Electoral Commission.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the presidential race that was held at the same time, President Maia Sandu won the first round with 42 percent of the vote in a field of 11, short of an outright majority. She will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who outperformed polls with around 26 percent of the vote, in a runoff on November 3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Monday, Sandu reiterated claims that unprecedented voter fraud and foreign interference had undermined the voting, calling it a “vile attack” on Moldova’s sovereignty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Unfortunately, the justice system failed to do enough to prevent vote-rigging and corruption," she told a news conference. “Here, too, we must draw a line, correct what went wrong, and learn the lesson. We heard you: we know we must do more to fight corruption.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moldovan authorities claim that Moscow has intensified a “hybrid war” campaign to destabilise the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections and backing a major vote-buying scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russia has repeatedly denied interfering, and, in turn, called on Sandu to "present evidence" of election interference in the country of 2.6 million people and alleged "anomalies" in Moldova's vote count.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU defended Sandu, with president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen hailing the outcome of the referendum in a post on X: "In the face of Russia's hybrid tactics, Moldova shows that it is independent, it is strong and it wants a European future!"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moldova applied to join the EU in the wake of the outbreak of Russia’s war with Ukraine in February 2022, and was granted candidate status, alongside Ukraine. Membership negotiations were agreed to start in June. (Agencies)

   Britain's King Charles was accused of "genocide" by an Indigenous senator at Australia's Parliament House on Monday, moments after he delivered a speech in which he paid his "respects to the traditional owners of the lands".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Charles, on his 16th official visit to Australia and his first major foreign trip since being diagnosed with cancer, had finished speaking when independent senator and Indigenous activist Lidia Thorpe shouted that she did not accept Charles' sovereignty over Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You committed genocide against our people," she said. "Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us – our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want treaty."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thorpe, who has disrupted previous events protesting over the colonisation of Australia, was stopped from approaching the king, who spoke quietly to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the podium but was otherwise unfazed. Thorpe was then escorted out of the chamber.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The protest was an outlier among a stream of tributes to Charles and Queen Camilla from dignitaries and well-wishers in the crowds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Albanese praised Charles for his long advocacy about the threat of climate change and spoke about the respect Australians had for their monarch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visit to parliament followed a trip to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra where the royal couple met more than a thousand well-wishers including Hephner, a nine-year old alpaca in a suit with a crown perched atop his fluffy white head.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hephner, named after Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, waited for hours alongside owner Robert Fletcher and long lines of others outside the memorial for the chance to greet the royal couple on their one-day tour of the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He has many outfits and this is one we've saved specifically for today," said Fletcher. "One king meets another king."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hephner's patience paid off. On a 30-minute walk to greet the crowds, Charles stopped to pat the alpaca, pulling back with a laugh when Hephner snorted in his face.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The royal couple continue their visit to Australia in Sydney on Tuesday, before heading to Samoa for a meeting of countries in the British Commonwealth. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korea on Monday summoned the Russian ambassador to criticise what it claimed as Pyongyang's decision to send thousands of soldiers to support Moscow's war in Ukraine, the foreign ministry there said, calling for their immediate withdrawal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 1,500 North Korean special forces soldiers are already in Russia acclimatising and likely to head to the front lines soon, Seoul's spy agency said on Friday, with additional troops set to depart soon, Pyongyang's first such deployment overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea has long claimed the nuclear-armed North is supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, and Seoul expressed alarm over the troop deployment, which comes after Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a military deal in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul expressed its "grave concerns regarding North Korea's recent dispatch of troops to Russia and strongly urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean forces", vice foreign minister Kim Hong-kyun told Russian ambassador Georgiy Zinoviev.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency released detailed satellite images showing the first batch of 1,500 North Korean special forces from the elite "Storm Corps" had arrived in Vladivostok on Russian military vessels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move "poses a significant security threat not only to South Korea but to the international community", Kim said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For his part, Russian ambassador Zinovyev "stressed that cooperation between Russia and North Korea... is not directed against the interests of South Korea's security", the embassy said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday that it hopes all parties will work to de-escalate the situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “China’s position is consistent and clear,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said during a regular briefing in Beijing, as he urged parties involved to “commit themselves to a political solution".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato, which has not yet confirmed the North Korean troop deployments, said that it "would mark a significant escalation" in the conflict, chief Mark Rutte said on X. (AFP/Reuters)

    Cuba's power grid collapses again as storm hits

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cuba's electrical grid collapsed again on Sunday, the fourth such failure in 48 hours, with a hurricane making landfall to compound the island's misery and threaten further havoc on its infrastructure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba earlier on Sunday had said it was making headway restoring service after multiple false starts, though millions of people remained without electricity more than two days after the grid's initial collapse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Restoration work began immediately," the country's energy and mines ministry said on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hurricane Oscar made landfall on the Caribbean island on Sunday, bringing strong winds, a powerful storm surge and rain to parts of eastern Cuba and threatening to further complicate the government's efforts to reestablish service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba's meteorological survey warned of "an extremely dangerous situation" in eastern Cuba, while the US National Hurricane Center reported winds of 120 kilometres per hour as the storm made its way across the island.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On the forecast track, the center of Oscar is expected to continue moving across eastern Cuba tonight and Monday, then emerge off the northern coast of Cuba late Monday and cross the central Bahamas on Tuesday," the Hurricane Center said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government canceled school through Wednesday – a near unprecedented move in Cuba – citing the hurricane and the ongoing energy crisis. Officials said only essential workers should report to work on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The repeated grid collapses marked a major setback in the government's efforts to quickly restore power to exhausted residents already suffering from severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The multiple setbacks in the first 48 hours also underscored the complexity of the work and the still precarious state of the country's grid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba had restored power to 160,000 clients in Havana just prior to the grid's Sunday collapse, giving some residents a glimmer of hope.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But housewife Anabel Gonzalez, of old Havana, a neighborhood popular with tourists, said she was growing desperate after three days without power.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My cell phone is dead and look at my refrigerator. The little that I had has all gone to waste," she said, pointing to bare shelves in her two-room home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Energy and mines minister Vicente de la O Levy told reporters earlier on Sunday he expected the grid to be fully functional by Monday or Tuesday but warned residents not to expect dramatic improvements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was not immediately clear how much the latest setback would delay the government's efforts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba's national electrical grid first crashed around midday on Friday after the island's largest power plant shut down, sowing chaos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The grid collapsed again on Saturday morning, state-run media reported
   <br/>
   <br/>
   By early evening on Saturday, authorities reported some progress restoring power before announcing another partial grid collapse. (Reuters)

    Pope creates 14 new saints at Vatican ceremony

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pope Francis created a new group of saints on Sunday, canonising 14 individuals including the "martyrs of Damascus", killed in Syria during the Ottoman Empire and symbols of Christian persecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Francis presided over the canonisation ceremony in Saint Peter's Square in the presence of thousands of Catholic faithful from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We enrol them among the saints, decreeing that they are to be venerated as such by the whole Church," proclaimed Francis, after reciting each name.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canonisation is the final step towards sainthood in the Catholic Church, following beatification.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Three conditions are required -- most crucially that the individual has performed at least two miracles. He or she must be deceased for at least five years and have led an exemplary Christian life.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the group are 11 individuals known as the "martyrs of Damascus", who have become saints some 160 years after their death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The eight Franciscan friars and three lay Maronites -- all siblings -- from a monastery were assassinated by Druze militants in July 1860 in the Syrian capital, then under Ottoman rule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They were beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1926.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Damascus is home to one of the oldest Christian communities in the world but its Christian population has dwindled to only about two percent today, according to the Vatican.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many citizens, Christian and otherwise, have left the city since the start of Syria's civil war in 2011.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The martyrdom of the Damascus group canonised on Sunday "is not very different from the situation of many Christians in the Middle East today", wrote Vatican News, the official news portal of the Vatican.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The other three individuals, who died early in the 20th century, founded religious communities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They are Italian missionary Giuseppe Allamano, Italian nun Elena Guerra and the Canadian Marie-Leonie Paradis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In May, Pope Francis announced he would canonise Italian teenager Carlos Acutis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The London-born adolescent spent his life spreading his faith online, earning the moniker "God's Influencer", before dying from leukaemia in 2006.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The date of that canonisation has not yet been set but it could take place in 2025, the Church's Jubilee year, when more than 30 million pilgrims are expected to descend on Rome. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto on Sunday took over as president of the world's third-largest democracy after sweeping the country's election with policies like free meals for schoolchildren and with the outgoing leader's son as his running mate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 73-year-old former special forces commander won the February 14 contest with nearly 60 percent of the vote and has spent the past nine months building a formidable parliamentary coalition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prabowo, wearing a traditional black hat and navy suit with a woven maroon and golden sarong, officially became Indonesia's eighth president on Sunday morning after he was sworn in during a ceremony at Indonesia's parliament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Xi Jinping congratulated him on taking office.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his message to Prabowo, Xi said China and Indonesia have traditionally been friendly neighbours, and the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year will create opportunities for further bilateral cooperation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vice President Han Zheng, as Xi's special representative, attended the inauguration.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new Indonesian leader, who unsuccessfully ran for the presidency twice before, said in a speech to lawmakers after taking his oath of office that he would be president for all Indonesians, even those who did not vote for him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said there were internal issues in the country that had to be grappled with, including corruption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Do we realise that our people and our children are malnourished? So many of our people don't have good jobs. So many of our schools are neglected," Prabowo said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ladies and gentlemen, we have to be courageous looking at all of this, and we have to be courageous solving all these problems."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was joined in the swearing-in ceremony by his running mate, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, 37, the eldest son of outgoing President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Flower boards set up outside the presidential palace congratulated Prabowo and Gibran, and thanked Jokowi for his decade as president.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jokowi supporters also attended celebrations to bid farewell to Indonesia's outgoing leader.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anneta Yuniar, a bystander who had excitedly waved at Jokowi's motorcade as it slowly made its way past supporters before the ceremony, said she would miss Jokowi but that Prabowo was a strong leader.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Prabowo will continue the development that Jokowi started. There's continuity. It's what I want," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jokowi has left an indelible mark on the nation of 280 million, presiding over a period of strong economic growth and massive infrastructure development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Critics also say, though, his rule has been marked by a rise in old-time patronage and dynastic politics, and they warn about diminished integrity in courts and other state institutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indonesian police and military have put in place strict security measures, deploying at least 100,000 personnel across the city, including snipers and anti-riot units. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Chinese Consulate in Myanmar’s second-largest city has been slightly damaged by an explosive device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The blast occurred at the consulate office in central Mandalay, south of the sprawling Royal Palace, around 7pm on Friday, local media said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were no casualties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the Myanmar military blamed "terrorists" for the explosion that damaged roof tiles on the two-storey consulate, adding that security forces were investigating in order to arrest anyone found responsible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No public claims of responsibility were made for the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, a resident living near the consulate in Mandalay’s Chanmyathazi township said security around the site has since been tightened, with nearby roads closed after the explosion.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Mexican navy announced on Saturday it had seized more than 8.3 tonnes of drugs in the Pacific Ocean, a record for a single operation at sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Navy personnel seized 8,361 kilogrammes of illicit cargo, which represents the largest amount of drugs seized in a maritime operation, unprecedented in history," said a statement from the Ministry of the Navy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It did not specify the type of the drugs, but said they were valued at 2.099 billion pesos (US$105 million).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Twenty-three people were arrested during the bust which took place southwest of the port of Lazaro Cardenas, off the western coast of Mexico.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drugs were distributed in six small boats and one of the vessels was a submersible, which implied a "complex" action on the part of the sailors, added the ministry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The largest drug seizure in Mexico's history was 23 tonnes of Colombian cocaine in November 2007.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mexico has for decades been the hub of drug trafficking to the United States, with a large number of cartels fighting for control of the trade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The state of Michoacan, off the coast of which the seizure took place, is the scene of clashes between criminal gangs, including the powerful Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful and violent criminal groups. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The regional assembly of Portugal's Azores Islands approved the creation of the largest protected marine area in the North Atlantic to reach international conservation goals well ahead of time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The approval places the archipelago at the forefront of global ocean conservation that aims to achieve the goals set by the United Nations of protecting 30 percent of the Earth's land and sea by 2030 under a global pact adopted last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The network will encompass almost 300,000 square kilometres and ensure the preservation of underwater mountain ranges and vulnerable marine ecosystems, including deep-sea corals, hydrothermal vents and marine species.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have acted in advance of the international conservation goals for 2030 with the creation of the largest marine park in the North Atlantic, with fully protected areas and highly protected areas," Bernardo Brito e Abreu, adviser to the Azorean government on maritime affairs said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He explained that half of the network would be designated as a fully protected area, which means fishing activities are not allowed. In the other half, designated as a highly protected area, only very selective fishing will be allowed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The nine-island archipelago is an autonomous region roughly 1,500 km west of mainland Portugal and home to unique marine biodiversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Azores government chief Jose Manuel Bolieiro said the region was leading by example at national, European and international levels in the management and protection of its waters and "making a significant contribution to Portugal meeting the international targets for the decade". (Reuters)

    Record high Colombian cocaine production in 2023: UN

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Colombia, the world's biggest cocaine exporter, set a new record last year for production of the drug and cultivation of the coca leaf it is made from, a United Nations report said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Coca leaf cultivation was 10 percent higher last year than in 2022, while cocaine production rose 53 percent from 1,738 tonnes to 2,600, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These were the highest numbers since the UN started monitoring in 2001. Most Colombian cocaine is destined for the United States and Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Coca leaf production now spreads over 253,000 hectares (625,100 acres) in the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The trend has been upward since 2014 despite a US-based war on drugs worth millions of US dollars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The areas of Colombia with the biggest increase in 2023 were the Cauca and Narino departments, both bastions of dissidents groups of the FARC guerrilla army that disbanded in 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 20 percent of the total area under coca cultivation in Colombia is on land belonging to communities of African descent, 10 percent on Indigenous reserves and 18 percent in protected forest areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Colombian city of Cali will host the COP16 global summit on biodiversity for two weeks starting on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Colombia's first-ever leftist President Gustavo Petro has accused US anti-drug policies of causing a "genocide" of Latin Americans for focusing on "repression" rather than prevention and public health. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on Friday night near Jabalia in the territory's north killed 33 people at a refugee camp.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal announced "33 deaths and dozens of wounded" while a medical source at the Al-Awda hospital said earlier that it had registered 22 dead and 70 wounded after the strike on the Tal al-Zaatar camp for Palestinian refugees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked for comment about overnight strikes in the area, an Israeli army spokesperson said they were "looking into it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On October 6, Israel launched a new offensive in northern Gaza, including around Jabalia, saying it was targeting Hamas fighters who were regrouping there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since then, scores of people have been killed in the area, which had already been hit hard by fighting earlier in the year-long war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The UN humanitarian affairs agency said on Friday night that it continued "to sound the alarm about the increasingly dire and dangerous situation that civilians in northern Gaza are facing. Families there are trying to survive in atrocious conditions, under heavy bombardment." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cuba on Friday experienced a nationwide blackout after the island's main power plant failed, causing the country's electricity grid to collapse, the energy ministry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The system was left without power nationwide" after the unexpected shutdown of the Antonio Guiteras power plant, Lazaro Guerra, director general of electricity at the ministry of energy and mines, told state television.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When the thermoelectric plant shut down "the system collapsed," he said, adding the government was working to restore service as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero announced the island was in the throes of an "energy emergency," with severe supply shortages leaving some provinces without power for up to 20 hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government on Thursday suspended all non-essential public sector activities in order to prioritize electricity supply to homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba gets its power from eight ageing thermal power plants, as well as seven floating plants leased from Turkish companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The island nation has been under a severe embargo by the United States since 1958. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   An SUV driver who ran over a cyclist following an altercation in central Paris has been charged with murder after a court hearing, a source close to the case said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 52-year-old driver of the SUV is accused of having deliberately targeted the cyclist, 27, on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another judge will now rule whether he should be held in custody ahead of trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuesday's incident in Paris's wealthy 8th district comes as tensions rise in the battle for street space in the congested capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tense exchanges between cyclists and drivers are commonplace in the city centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The driver, whose teenage daughter was also in the car, was arrested on the spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, the motorist and the cyclist were seen having an angry dispute by the side of the road.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   French associations promoting cycling have condemned the incident, with "Paris en Selle" calling it "an unacceptable tragedy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year, 226 cyclists died on French roads. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Kyiv said on Friday it had received the bodies of 501 servicemen killed fighting Russian forces, mainly in eastern Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The exchange of prisoners and bodies of killed military personnel remains one of the few areas of cooperation between Moscow and Kyiv since Russia attacked in 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As a result of repatriation measures, 501 bodies of fallen Ukrainian defenders were returned to Ukraine," the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The announcement represents one of the largest repatriations of killed Ukrainian servicemen since the beginning of the war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the remains were returned from the eastern Donetsk region, said the agency. Russian forces have been advancing steadily there since their capture of the industrial hub of Avdiivka in February.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several state bodies had helped coordinate the return including the defence forces, the agency added, acknowledging the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Representatives of law enforcement agencies and forensic experts will identify the victims," the coordination centre said in its statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After identification, the bodies of our defenders will be handed over to their families for a proper burial." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday confirmed its leader Yahya Sinwar had been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, a day after Israel announced his death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We mourn the great leader, the martyred brother, Yahya Sinwar, Abu Ibrahim," Qatar-based Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya said in a recorded video statement broadcast by Al Jazeera.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinwar became Israel's most wanted man after the October 7, 2023 attack, the deadliest in Israeli history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his statement, Hayya said Hamas would not release the hostages it seized from Israel during the attack until the war in Gaza ends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The hostages "will not return... unless the aggression against our people in Gaza stops," the senior Hamas official said, as he called on Israel to withdraw from Gaza and release Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hayya said the militant group would take strength from Sinwar's killing, which he said has set him among "the leaders and symbols of the movement who preceded him." (AFP)

   British Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Beijing on an official two-day visit, with the UK's new Labour government seeking to demonstrate its willingness to engage in a pragmatic and strategic approach to ties with China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lammy's visit is only the second by a British foreign secretary in six years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the two sides would focus on implementing the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries during the phone talks in August, and have in-depth communication on enhancing strategic mutual trust and strengthening dialogue and cooperation in various fields.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lammy's visit includes a meeting with his counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing on Friday before visiting Shanghai to meet British businesses operating in China. (Xinhua/Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said South Korea is a foreign and hostile nation, state media KCNA reported on Friday, with photos showing Kim conferring with high-ranking soldiers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim discussed the use of "offensive forces" against the South as retaliation for any move that infringes on its sovereignty, the report said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no elaboration on what forces might be used.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The report comes a day after KCNA said North Korea amended its constitution to designate the South as a "hostile state".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim has increasingly lashed out at South Korea this year, accusing Seoul of colluding with Washington to seek the collapse of his regime and has pushed for a clear break with decades of policy engagement with the South, including the scrapping of unification as a goal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The reclusive state blasted road and rail links with South Korea this week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Those actions underscored "not only the physical closure but also the end of the evil relationship with Seoul," KCNA quoted Kim as saying.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul has said that if North Korea were to inflict harm upon the safety of its people, "that day will be the end of the North Korean regime."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim made the remarks while inspecting the headquarters of the 2nd Corps of the North Korean army on Thursday, KCNA said, a major military unit that includes several forward-deployed brigades with heavy weapons aimed at the South.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the visit, he also said the changed nature of the South Korea-US alliance and their different, more developed military manoeuvres, highlight the importance of a stronger North Korean nuclear deterrent. (Reuters)

    Biden heads to Germany to discuss Middle East

  <img alt="US President Joe Biden gets ready to board Air Force One in Maryland. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775044_1_20241017214236.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US President Joe Biden took off  onThursday on a swift farewell trip to Germany, for talks with allies to shore up Ukraine's increasingly desperate fight against Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was also expected to discuss the escalating crisis in the Middle East, as Israel said it was investigating whether Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar had been killed in a military operation in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a flying 24-hour visit to Berlin, the US leader will meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, before they are both joined for talks by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was originally due in Germany last week for a multi-day visit that would have included a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a major summit of Kyiv's allies, but he postponed it as Hurricane Milton barrelled towards Florida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The White House said the shorter, rescheduled visit to the key Nato ally would "further strengthen the close bond the United States and Germany share as allies and friends and coordinate on geopolitical priorities, including Ukraine's defence against Russian aggression and events in the Middle East."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was also keen to make the visit to thank Scholz for facilitating a prisoner exchange deal with Russia earlier this year that freed US reporter Evan Gershkovich, US officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the focus will be on Ukraine, with Biden, who dropped out of the 2024 White House race in July, keen to consolidate Western military aid for Kyiv in his final three months in office.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Allies are nervously watching the November 5 US presidential election to see if it brings a return of Donald Trump, who has opposed the current level of US support for Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump has also repeatedly pledged to push through a peace deal if elected -- even before taking office -- that Kyiv fears would involve it giving up chunks of land to Moscow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zelensky told allies in Brussels on Thursday that Ukraine must be in a position of strength before any peace talks with Russia, as he explained his "victory plan" to EU leaders and NATO defence chiefs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than two and a half years into the war, Kyiv is slowly but steadily losing territory in its eastern Donbas region and under mounting pressure to forge an exit strategy -- which it says must start with ramped-up Western support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden announced a fresh US$425 million arms package including air defense and armored vehicles for Ukraine in a call with Zelensky on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States is by far the biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine's battle against the 2022 Russian invasion, followed by Germany. (AFP)

    Israel confirms killing of Hamas leader

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Israeli military on Thursday announced the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by its forces in southern Gaza the previous day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military "confirms that after a year-long pursuit, yesterday (Wednesday), October 16, 2024, IDF (military) soldiers from the Southern Command eliminated Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Hamas terrorist organisation, in an operation in the southern Gaza Strip," it said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The dozens of operations carried out by the IDF and the ISA (Shin Bet internal security agency) over the last year and in recent weeks in the area where he was eliminated restricted Yahya Sinwar's operational movement as he was pursued by the forces and led to his elimination," the military added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "IDF soldiers of the 828th Brigade (Bislach) operating in the area identified and eliminated three terrorists. The process of identifying the body confirms the elimination of Yahya Sinwar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel accuses Sinwar, 61, of being the mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, along with Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military has said Deif was killed in a strike earlier this year, though the Palestinian group has not confirmed it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, Sinwar took over as the leader of Hamas, following the death of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran on July 31. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hamas attack last year resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people on Israeli soil, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures that include hostages killed in captivity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed 42,438 people, a majority of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN acknowledges the figures reliability. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday said Ukraine must be in a position of strength before any peace talks with Russia, as he explained his "victory plan" to EU leaders and NATO defence chiefs in Brussels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than two and a half years into the war, Kiev is slowly but steadily losing new territory in its eastern Donbas region and under mounting pressure to forge an exit strategy -- which it says must start with ramped-up Western support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ukraine is ready for real diplomacy, but for it, we must be strong," Zelensky said as he headed into talks with the EU's 27 leaders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A forcefully imposed truce instead of fair peace never provided security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Russia will resort to diplomacy only when it sees that it cannot achieve anything by force," Zelensky added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is the plan. This is exactly what's needed, and we must create the right conditions to end this war."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the EU summit Zelensky was to join defence ministers for the first of two days of talks between NATO's 32 member states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While calling it a "strong signal," NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte cautioned ahead of time he was not endorsing Zelensky's "whole plan" -- which calls first and foremost for an immediate invitation to join the alliance, a plea widely seen as unrealistic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zelensky's plan also rejects any territorial concessions, calls for Western allies to lift restrictions on using donated long-range weapons to target Russian military sites, and suggests deploying a "non-nuclear strategic deterrence package" on Ukrainian territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ukrainian leader has travelled in recent weeks to Washington, Paris, Berlin, Rome and London to defend his plan -- unveiled to Ukrainian lawmakers Wednesday -- but it has yet to earn backing from Western capitals. (AFP)

    India slams 'cavalier' Trudeau over separatist murder

  <img alt="Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has come under renewed attack from India over his handling of the killing of a Sikh separatist in Canada. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774958_1_20241017133828.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   India criticised Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday as "cavalier" over his handling of the disastrous diplomatic fallout following the 2023 killing of a Sikh separatist in Canada.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Delhi held firm its defiant stance towards Ottawa -- an approach in sharp contrast to its compliant attitude this week towards the United States, where India is also accused of directing a separate assassination plot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canada has alleged that India arranged the killing of a Sikh separatist, naturalised Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, murdered in the parking lot of a Sikh temple in Vancouver in June 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India has called the allegations "preposterous".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Trudeau, at a parliamentary inquiry on Wednesday, said Canada had "clear indications that India had violated Canada's sovereignty".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canada's top envoy to New Delhi, Stewart Wheeler, who India has ordered to leave by Saturday night, has said Ottawa had provided "credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the Government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India's foreign ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday said they had not seen that evidence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Canada has presented us (India) no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations that it has chosen to level against India and Indian diplomats," he said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nijjar -- who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 -- had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four Indian nationals have been arrested in connection with Nijjar's murder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year, the Indian government briefly curbed visas for Canadians and this week both countries expelled each other's ambassadors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Delhi's response to Washington has been very different, with the US State Department on Wednesday saying India had told it that an intelligence operative accused of directing an assassination plot on American soil was no longer in government service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US prosecutors charged an Indian citizen last November over a foiled attempt in New York to kill an advocate for a separate Sikh homeland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The indictment described an "Indian government employee," who was not publicly named, as recruiting the hitman and directing the assassination plot remotely, including by arranging the delivery of US$15,000 in cash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India's Hindustan Times, quoting an unnamed US official, said on Monday that India not only removed but arrested the employee on "local charges."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The State Department did not confirm the arrest. (AFP)

    US uses stealth bombers to strike Houthi targets

  <img alt="The United States carried out B-2 bomber strikes on weapon storage facilities in areas of Yemen controlled by the Houthi rebels, according to the US military and defence department. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774947_1_20241017121451.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   American long-range B-2 stealth bombers launched airstrikes early on Thursday morning targeting underground bunkers used by Yemen's Houthi rebels, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It wasn't immediately clear what damage was done in the strikes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it is incredibly rare for the B-2 Spirit to be used in the strikes targeting the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin in a statement said the B-2 bombers targeted “five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike also appeared to be an indirect warning to Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor who have twice targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks over the last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,” Austin said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Austin and the US military's Central Command offered no immediate assessment on the damage done.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships travelling through the waterway, which once saw US$1 trillion a year of cargo pass through it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started last October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a US-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the US or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Later on Thursday, the Houthis vowed to retaliate following the strike on the weapons storage facilities in areas controlled by the Iran-backed group.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We confirm that the American aggression will not pass without a response," said a statement from the group's political bureau. (Agencies)

   British singer Liam Payne, a former member of the group One Direction, died on Wednesday aged 31 after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Argentina, police in Buenos Aires said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Liam James Payne, composer and guitarist, former member of the band One Direction, died today after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Palermo," a police statement said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boy band sensation One Direction emerged in 2010 when then-teenagers Payne, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik appeared on the British television contest "The X Factor."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2016, the group announced it was going on an indefinite hiatus, but not splitting up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Payne announced he was working on a solo album that same year, following in the footsteps of other band members. (AFP)

   Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday proposed closer three-way ties with Russia and Mongolia at a meeting with counterparts from the neighbouring countries on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Li said the nation is willing to make contributions to the development and revitalisation of the two countries and the prosperity and stability of the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He told Mishustin that China was willing to strengthen trade and energy ties with Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li added that enhancing cooperation and promoting deeper and practical trilateral cooperation with Russia and Mongolia would better benefit the people of the three countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mongolia is not a member of the SCO, having chosen instead to be an observer state since 2004. The landlocked nation is on the planned route of a major pipeline that Russia wants to build to carry 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas each year from its Yamal region to China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Eurasian leaders have gathered in the Pakistani capital Islamabad for the SCO summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Addressing the event, Li said the SCO is an important platform for safeguarding regional peace and stability and promoting the development and prosperity of all countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his opening remarks, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for the expansion of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Flagship projects like the Belt and Road Initiative of President Xi Jinping, the China-Pakistan economic corridor, which is in its second phase and the international north south transport corridor, should be expanded focusing on developing road, rail and digital infrastructure that enhances integration and cooperation across our region," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in attendance was India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who is the first Indian foreign minister to visit Pakistan in nearly a decade with ties between the nuclear-armed rival neighbours continuing to be frosty. (Agencies)
