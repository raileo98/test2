<div class="itemFullText">
 A DHL cargo plane crashed into a house on Monday morning near Lithuania's capital, killing at least one person.
 <br>
  <br>
  The head of the country's police said plane crashed shortly before landing at Vilnius airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It fell a few kilometres before the airport, it just skidded for a few hundred metres, its debris somewhat caught a residential house," said Police Commissioner-General Renatas Požėla. "Residential infrastructure around the house was on fire, and the house was slightly damaged, but we managed to evacuate people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuanian’s public broadcaster LRT, quoting an emergency official, said two people had been taken to the hospital after the crash, and one was later pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lithuanian airport authority identified the aircraft as a DHL cargo plane arriving from Leipzig, Germany. It posted on the social platform X that city services including a fire truck were on site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flight-tracking data from FlightRadar24, analysed by The Associated Press, showed the aircraft made a turn to the north of the airport, lining up for landing, before crashing a little more than 1.5 kilometres short of the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities did not immediately offer a cause for the crash, which happened just before 5.30 am local time. Weather at the airport was around freezing temperature, with clouds before sunrise and winds around 30 kph.
  <br>
  <br>
  DHL Group, headquartered in Bonn, Germany, did not immediately return a call for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DHL aircraft was operated by Swiftair, a Madrid-based contractor. The carrier could not be immediately reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737 was 31 years old, which is considered by experts to be an older airframe, though that’s not unusual for cargo flights. (AP)

    Far-right candidate surprises in Romania elections

<img alt="Calin Georgescu has emerged as the surprise leader in Romania's presidential election. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780699_1_20241125121617.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A little-known, far-right populist took the lead in Romania’s presidential election on Sunday, electoral data showed, and will likely face leftist Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu in a run-off vote in two weeks, an outcome that has rocked the country's political landscape.
 <br>
  <br>
  Calin Georgescu, who ran independently, led the polls with around 22 percent of the vote, while Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party, or PSD, trailed at 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party, or USR, stood at about 18 percent, and George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, took around 14 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After polls closed, 9.4 million people — about 52 percent of eligible voters — had cast their ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second round of the vote will be held December 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen candidates ran for the presidency in the European Union and Nato member country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president serves a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georgescu, 62, ran independently and was not widely known. He outperformed most local surveys, sending shockwaves through Romania's political establishment as he ascended to poll position.
  <br>
  <br>
  After casting his ballot on Sunday, Georgescu said in a post on Facebook that he voted “For the unjust, for the humiliated, for those who feel they do not matter and actually matter the most.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, said that Georgescu’s unexpected poll performance appears to be a “large protest or revolt against the establishment.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The mainstream political parties have lost the connection with regular Romanians,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georgescu lacks an agenda, Andrei added, and has a vague and populist manifesto with positions that are “beyond the normal discourse."
  <br>
  <br>
  His stances include supporting Romanian farmers, reducing dependency on imports, and ramping up energy and food production.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to his website, Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania's environment ministry in the 1990s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted to his popular TikTok account, where he has amassed 1.6 million likes, depict him attending church, doing judo, running around an oval track, and speaking on podcasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Sunday's vote, many had expected to see Simion, a vocal supporter of US President-elect Donald Trump, face Ciolacu in the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  He campaigned for reunification with Moldova, which this year renewed a five-year ban on him entering the country over security concerns, and he is banned for the same reason from neighbouring Ukraine. (AP)

<img alt="Yamandu Orsi speaks on stage following early results of the presidential run-off between him and the candidate of the ruling conservative coalition Alvaro Delgado. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780693_1_20241125115903.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The presidential candidate of the conservative coalition that has governed Uruguay for the past five years conceded defeat on Sunday after a tight run-off election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The results means the South American nation joined others around the world in rebuking the incumbent party in a year of landmark elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even as the vote count continued, Álvaro Delgado, the centre-right government’s candidate, told supporters at his campaign headquarters in the capital of Montevideo that “with sadness, but without guilt, we can congratulate the winner,” referring to left-wing challenger Yamandú Orsi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fireworks erupted over the stage where Orsi, 57, a working-class former history teacher and two-time mayor from Uruguay's centre-left coalition known as the Broad Front, claimed victory as crowds flocked to greet him.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The country of liberty, equality and fraternity has triumphed once again,” he said, vowing to unite the nation of 3.4 million people after such a tight vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Let's understand that there is another part of our country who have different feelings today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These people will also have to help build a better country. We need them too.”
  <br>
  <br>
  With more than 91 percent of the votes counted, Orsi had close to 50 percent support compared to Delgado’s 46 percent in an election in which nearly 90 percent of voters turned out, according to preliminary data released by the Electoral Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest were blank votes or non-voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  While failing to entice apathetic young voters and generating extraordinary indecision, Uruguay's lacklustre electoral campaigns steered clear of the anti-establishment fury that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere in the world, like in the United States and neighbouring Argentina.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people have been arrested in the United Arab Emirates in connection with the alleged murder of an Israeli citizen, the Emirati interior ministry said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ministry statement did not give details on the suspects or say if they had been charged, but said all legal powers would be used "to respond decisively and without leniency to any actions or attempts that threaten societal stability".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office had denounced the killing of the rabbi, Zvi Kogan, 28, as a "heinous anti-semitic terrorist act" and said Israel would do everything it could to bring those responsible to justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local authorities say Kogan was a resident of the UAE and a Moldovan national.
  <br>
  <br>
  He worked with the New York-based Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement and was reported missing on Thursday. His body was found on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He ran a kosher grocery store in Dubai, where Israelis have flocked for commerce and tourism since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in the 2020 Abraham Accords.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement has held through more than a year of soaring regional tensions unleashed by Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza and its attack of Lebanon, after months of fighting with the Hezbollah militant group, have stoked anger among Emiratis, Arab nationals and others living in the UAE.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Sunday, the UAE’s state-run WAM news agency acknowledged Kogan’s disappearance but pointedly did not acknowledge he held Israeli citizenship, referring to him only as being Moldovan. (Agencies)

<img alt="People mourn over the graves of relatives on Friday, who were killed when gunmen opened fire on passenger vehicles in Kurram.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistani government team mediated a seven-day ceasefire deal between rival sectarian groups on Sunday, halting days of clashes that have killed some 70 people and injured dozens in the northwest of the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The violence began when gunmen attacked convoys of civilian vehicles on Thursday, killing at least 40 people, mostly Shi'ite Muslims.
  <br>
  <br>
  That sparked retaliatory attacks against Sunni Muslim residents and there were pitched battles between armed groups from both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armed Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims have engaged in tribal and sectarian rivalry for decades over a land dispute in Kurram district near the Afghanistan border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both sides have agreed to a week-long ceasefire which is expected to be extended," Muhammad Ali Saif, a member of the mediation team, told Reuters by phone, adding that major clashes had already stopped.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saif, who is the information minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province - where Kurram is located - said both sides also agreed to exchange prisoners, including women and the bodies of those killed in the clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prisoners and bodies would be exchanged with assistance from Pakistani paramilitary forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team flew into Parachinar, Kurram's main city, on Saturday and met Shi'ite and Sunni tribal leaders with the entire district under curfew and armed groups roaming the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saif said news of the ceasefire should also halt smaller skirmishes that had been reported in remote areas of the district.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another member of the mediation team, Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, the police chief of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said Shi'ite leaders were demanding the immediate arrest of those involved in attacking passenger vehicles, as well as compensation for the victims and safety assurances for travelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is yet to identify or publicly name who the attackers were and no one has claimed responsibility. (Reuters)

<img alt="Josep Borrell (pictured) speaks during a press conference after meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri in Beirut. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780634_1_20241124203648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for an "immediate ceasefire" in the Israel-Hezbollah war while on a visit to the Lebanese capital for talks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since September 23, Israel has intensified its air campaign in Lebanon, later sending in ground troops following nearly a year of limited exchanges of fire initiated by Hezbollah in support of its ally Hamas after the Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see only one possible way ahead: an immediate ceasefire and the full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701," Borrell said after meeting Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who has led mediation efforts on behalf of Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Resolution 1701 ended the last Hezbollah-Israel war of 2006 and stated that Lebanese troops and UN peacekeepers should be the only armed forces in the country's south, where Hezbollah holds sway.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also called for Israel to withdraw troops from Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Back in September I came and was still hoping we could prevent a full-fledged war of Israel attacking Lebanon," Borrell said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two months later Lebanon is on the brink of collapse."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the European Union was ready to provide 200 million euros for Lebanon's army, whose deployment in larger numbers along the border forms a crucial point in truce talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  France and Washington have been spearheading ceasefire efforts, with US envoy Amos Hochstein visiting Lebanon and Israel this week to discuss a truce plan based on implementing Resolution 1701.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must pressure the Israeli government and maintain the pressure on Hezbollah to accept the US proposal for a ceasefire," Borrell said, calling for an "immediate" truce. (AFP)

 Raging orange flames and thick black smoke billowed into the sky on Sunday as fire ripped through hundreds of houses in a closely built slum area of the Philippine capital Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manila Fire District said around 1,000 houses were burned in the blaze that is thought to have started on the second floor of one of the homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no immediate reports of casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drone footage shared online by the city's disaster agency showed houses in Isla Puting Bato village of Manila razed to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  The structures housed around 2,000 families, according to the fire department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Village resident Leonila Abiertas, 65, lost almost all her possessions, but managed to save her late husband's ashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only got the urn with the ashes of my husband," a crying Abiertas told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really don't know how I can start my life again after this fire."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire and disaster services deployed 36 trucks and four fire boats while the country's air force sent in two helicopters to help extinguish the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That area is fire-prone since most of the houses there are made of light materials," firefighter Geanelli Nunez told AFP. (AFP)

 A man was shot dead and three members of the security services wounded after gunfire at dawn on Sunday in the neighbourhood in Jordan's capital where the Israeli embassy is located, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Public Security Directorate announced that it dealt with an incident of gunfire at a patrol operating in the Rabieh area in the capital, Amman, at dawn on Sunday," the official Petra news agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said a gunman opened fire on a patrol and was later surrounded by security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man "started firing gunshots at the security force, which in turn applied the rules of engagement, which resulted in the killing of the perpetrator", the agency added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said three public security personnel were injured during the incident and were receiving treatment. (AFP)

    Climate summit US$300bn deal 'a paltry sum'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The world approved a bitterly negotiated climate deal on Sunday but poorer nations most at the mercy of worsening disasters dismissed a US$300 billion a year pledge from wealthy historic polluters as insultingly low.
 <br>
  <br>
  After two exhausting weeks of chaotic bargaining and sleepless nights, nearly 200 nations banged through the contentious finance pact in the early hours in a sports stadium in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the applause had barely subsided in Baku when India delivered a full-throated rejection of the dollar-figure just agreed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount that is proposed to be mobilised is abysmally poor. It's a paltry sum," said Indian delegate Leena Nandan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This document is little more than an optical illusion. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nations had struggled to reconcile long-standing divisions over how much rich nations most accountable for historic climate change should provide to poorer countries least responsible but most impacted by Earth's rapid warming.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra said COP29 would be remembered as "the start of a new era for climate finance".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sleep-deprived diplomats, huddled in anxious groups, were still revising the final phrasing on the plenary floor hours before the deal passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  At points, the talks appeared on the brink of collapse, with developing nations storming out of meetings and threatening to walk away should rich nations not cough up more cash.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the end -- despite repeating that no deal is better than a bad deal -- they did not stand in the way of an agreement, despite it falling well short of what they wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final deal commits developed nations to pay at least US$300 billion a year by 2035 to help developed countries green their economies and prepare for worse disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is up from US$100 billion under an existing pledge but was slammed as offensively low by developing nations who had demanded much more.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This COP has been a disaster for the developing world," said Mohamed Adow, the Kenyan director of Power Shift Africa, a think tank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a betrayal of both people and planet, by wealthy countries who claim to take climate change seriously."
  <br>
  <br>
  A group of 134 developing countries had pushed for at least US$500 billion from rich governments to build resilience against climate change and cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN climate chief Simon Stiell acknowledged the deal was imperfect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country got everything they wanted, and we leave Baku with a mountain of work still to do. So this is no time for victory laps," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States and EU have wanted newly wealthy emerging economies like China -- the world's largest emitter -- to chip in.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final deal "encourages" developing countries to make contributions on a voluntary basis, reflecting no change for China which already provides climate finance on its own terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy nations said it was politically unrealistic to expect more in direct government funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump, a sceptic of both climate change and foreign assistance, returns to the White House in January and a number of other Western countries have seen right-wing backlashes against the green agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal posits a larger overall target of US$1.3 trillion per year to cope with rising temperatures and disasters, but most would come from private sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy countries and small island nations were also concerned by efforts led by Saudi Arabia to water down calls from last year's summit in Dubai to phase out fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main texts proposed in Baku lacked any explicit mention of the Dubai commitment to "transitioning away from fossil fuels".
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of countries had accused Azerbaijan, an authoritarian oil and gas exporter, of lacking the experience and will to meet the moment, as the planet again sets temperature records and faces rising deadly disasters. (AFP)

    Sudan army says recaptures key state capital

<img alt="Since April 2023, the war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 11 million. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780565_1_20241123223549.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sudanese army said on Saturday it had retaken a key state capital south of Khartoum from rival paramilitaries who had held it for the past five months.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Sennar state capital of Sinja is a strategic prize in the 19-month-old war between the regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces as it lies on a key road linking army-controlled areas of eastern and central Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army said that Sinja had been "liberated... from the terrorist militia."
  <br>
  <br>
  It posted footage on social media that it said had been filmed inside the main base in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sinja has returned to the embrace of the nation," the information minister of the army-backed government, Khaled al-Aiser, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aiser's office said armed forces chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan had travelled to the city of Sennar, 60 kilometres to the north, on Saturday to "inspect the operation and celebrate the liberation of Sinja."
  <br>
  <br>
  The RSF had taken the two cities in a lightning offensive in June that saw nearly 726,000 civilians flee, according to UN figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Human rights groups have said that those who were unwilling or unable to leave have faced months of arbitrary violence by RSF fighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinja teacher Abdullah al-Hassan spoke of his "indescribable joy" at seeing the army enter the city after "months of terror."
  <br>
  <br>
  "At any moment, you were waiting for militia fighters to barge in and beat you or loot you," the 53-year-old said by telephone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides in the Sudanese conflict have been accused of war crimes, including indiscriminately shelling homes, markets and hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The RSF has also been accused of summary executions, systematic sexual violence and rampant looting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The paramilitaries control nearly all of the vast western region of Darfur as well as large swathes of Kordofan in the south. They also hold much of the capital Khartoum and the key farming state of Al-Jazira to its south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since April 2023, the war has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 11 million – creating what the UN says is the world's largest displacement crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the eastern state of Gedaref – where more than 1.1 million displaced people have sought refuge – Asia Khedr, 46, said she hoped her family's ordeal might soon be at an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll finally go home and say goodbye to this life of displacement and suffering," she said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain and Ireland faced travel chaos on Saturday as a winter storm battered northwest Europe with strong winds, heavy rain, snow and ice.
 <br>
  <br>
  Storm Bert left at least 60,000 properties in Ireland without power and closed roads and some ferry and train routes on both sides of the Irish Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Media footage showed flooding in the west of Ireland, while floods prompted rail closures in Northern Ireland and snow impacted travel across Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heaviest snow hit Scotland and parts of northern and central England, with dozens of flood alerts in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK Met Office issued warnings for snow and ice for those regions, warning there was a "good chance some rural communities could be cut off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scottish hills could see up to 40 centimetres of snow, while winds approaching 113 kilometres per hour were recorded in parts of Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferry operator DFDS cancelled services on some routes until Monday, with sailings from Newhaven and Dover in southern England to Dieppe and Calais in France severely affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flights were disrupted at Newcastle Airport due to heavy snow, with some flights diverted to Belfast and Edinburgh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avanti West Coast, which runs rail services between England and Scotland, advised customers not to attempt travel beyond the northern English city of Preston, as it cancelled numerous trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Highways also issued a "severe weather alert," warning of "blizzard conditions" affecting Yorkshire and northeast England, with a number of road closures announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Met Eireann, the Irish National Meteorological Service, had also issued a yellow warning for "very strong winds and heavy rain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The worst impacted areas for power outages in Ireland were in western and northwestern counties, according to ESB Networks, which runs the country's electricity system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Crews and contractors are deployed and restoring power in impacted areas where it is safe to do so," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 4,000 properties across Britain were without power by mid-Saturday -- the majority in southwest England – with the National Grid operator saying power had been restored to "many homes and businesses."
  <br>

  Blackburn Rovers Championship football fixture against Portsmouth was postponed because of the storm. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lebanon said an Israeli air strike in the heart of Beirut that brought down a residential building and jolted residents across the city killed at least 11 people on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The attack in the capital was followed by others in the city's southern suburbs after calls by the Israeli military to evacuate the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has not commented on the strike in central Beirut, while Hezbollah has yet to mention it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue operations were underway in the area on Saturday morning, with an excavator removing the rubble of the eight-storey building, and a fire truck and civil defence rescuers stationed nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The strike was so strong it felt like the building was about to fall on our heads," said Samir, 60, who lives in a building facing the one that was destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he fled his home in the middle of the night with his wife and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw two dead people on the ground... The children started crying and their mother cried even more," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli strike, which hit the working-class Basta neighbourhood, killed at least 11 people and wounded 63, Lebanon's health ministry said, adding it had also left behind "a large amount of body parts that are being identified."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The final death toll will be determined after DNA tests are carried out," the ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The state-run National News Agency said Israeli jets had launched six missiles at the structure, causing "widespread destruction in buildings" nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pre-dawn attack in Basta was not preceded by an evacuation warning from Israel's military.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Lebanese security source said on condition of anonymity that the strike had "targeted a leading Hezbollah figure," though it was unclear if they were killed. The official did not name the figure. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea has decided not to attend a memorial ceremony set to take place in Japan to honour wartime forced labour victims, including many Koreans, its foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing unspecified disagreements with Tokyo.
 <br>
  <br>
  The East Asian neighbours have long been at odds over historical issues linked to Japan's brutal colonial occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including sexual slavery and forced labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, a network of mines on a Japanese island infamous for using conscripted wartime labour was added to Unesco's World Heritage register, after South Korea voiced objections to its listing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul had dropped its initial objections "on the condition that Japan faithfully implements the recommendation... to reflect the 'full history' at the Sado Gold Mine site."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo had agreed to host a memorial event every year – its first edition set to be held on Sado Island on Sunday – to honour the forced labour victims, as a condition for South Korea's consent to the Unesco listing.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Saturday, Seoul said the country would "not attend the Sado mine memorial ceremony, scheduled for November 24, taking into account various circumstances surrounding the event."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was insufficient time to reconcile differing positions between the diplomatic authorities of both countries, making it unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable agreement before the ceremony," it added, without elaborating further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo said earlier this week that Akiko Ikuina, a parliamentary vice minister at Japan's foreign ministry, will attend the ceremony as the government's representative, according to Seoul's Yonhap news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was met with criticism from some local media outlets in Seoul, as she has visited the Yasukuni Shrine – a site considered highly sensitive in South Korea due to the enshrinement of some of Japan's war criminals there. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 32 people were killed and 47 wounded in sectarian clashes in northwest Pakistan, an official said on Saturday, two days after attacks on Shi'ite passenger convoys killed 43.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sporadic fighting between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims in the mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan has killed around 150 over the past months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fighting between Shi'ite and Sunni communities continues at multiple locations. According to the latest reports, 32 people have been killed which include 14 Sunnis and 18 Shi'ites," a senior administrative official said on condition of anonymity on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, gunmen opened fire on two separate convoys of Shi'ite Muslims travelling with a police escort in Kurram, killing 43 while 11 wounded are still in "critical condition", officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In retaliation, Shi'ite Muslims on Friday evening attacked several Sunni locations in the Kurram district, once a semi-autonomous region, where sectarian violence has resulted in the deaths of hundreds over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Around 7 pm (1400 GMT), a group of enraged Shi'ite individuals attacked the Sunni-dominated Bagan Bazaar," said a senior police officer stationed in Kurram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After firing, they set the entire market ablaze and entered nearby homes, pouring petrol and setting them on fire. Initial reports suggest over 300 shops and more than 100 houses have been burned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local Sunnis "also fired back at the attackers," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Javedullah Mehsud, a senior official in Kurram said there were "efforts to restore peace ... (through) the deployment of security forces" and with the help of "local elders." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union, United States and other wealthy countries at the COP29 climate summit have agreed to raise their offer of a global finance target to US$300 billion per year by 2035, sources said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The summit had been due to finish on Friday but ran into overtime as negotiators from nearly 200 countries – who must adopt the deal by consensus – tried to reach agreement on the world's climate funding plan for the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shift in position came after a US$250 billion proposal for a deal, drafted by Azerbaijan's COP29 presidency on Friday, was panned by developing countries as insultingly low.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear if the wealthy countries' revised position had been communicated to developing countries at COP29, and whether it would be enough to win their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five sources with knowledge of the closed-door discussions said the EU had agreed they could accept the higher number. Two of the sources said the United States, Australia and Britain were also on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  A European Commission spokesperson and an Australian government spokesperson both declined to comment on the negotiations. The US delegation at COP29 and the UK energy ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates were awaiting a new draft text of the deal on climate finance on Saturday after negotiators worked through the night to bridge wide gaps in their positions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The COP29 talks have laid bare the divisions between wealthy governments constrained by tight domestic budgets and developing nations reeling from the soaring costs of storms, floods and droughts fuelled by climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new goal is intended to replace developed countries' previous commitment to provide US$100 billion in climate finance for poorer nations per year by 2020. That goal was met two years late, in 2022, and expires in 2025. (Reuters)

    Fears for Gaza hospitals as fuel and aid run low

<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Friday that hospitals have only two days' fuel left before they must restrict services, after the United Nations warned aid delivery to the war-devastated territory is being crippled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The warning came a day after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant more than a year into the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN and others have repeatedly decried humanitarian conditions, particularly in northern Gaza, where Israel said on Friday it had killed two commanders involved in Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza medics said an overnight Israeli raid on the cities of Beit Lahia and nearby Jabalia resulted in dozens killed or missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marwan al-Hams, director of Gaza's field hospitals, told reporters all hospitals in the Palestinian territory "will stop working or reduce their services within 48 hours due to the occupation's (Israel's) obstruction of fuel entry".
  <br>
  <br>
  World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was "deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of 80 patients, including 8 in the intensive care unit" at Kamal Adwan hospital, one of just two partly operating in northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late Thursday, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Muhannad Hadi, said, "The delivery of critical aid across Gaza, including food, water, fuel and medical supplies, is grinding to a halt."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that for more than six weeks, Israeli authorities "have been banning commercial imports" while "a surge in armed looting" has hit aid convoys. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Armed robbers snatched jewels worth millions from a work by famed Parisian goldsmith Joseph Chaumet and classed a national treasure in a brazen heist at a French museum.
 <br>
  <br>
  Motorbike-riding thieves arrived at the Hieron Museum in Paray-le-Monial in central France at around 4:00 pm (1500 GMT) on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three entered the building and one stood guard outside, mayor Jean-Marc Nesme said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group fired several shots before heading for the museum's star exhibit, a three-metre work executed in 1904 depicting the life of Christ in precious metals, jewels and ivory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known as "Via Vitae", it is classed as a national treasure by France's culture ministry, with an estimated value of up to seven million euros (US$7.3 million), mayor Nesme said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intruders sawed through the armoured glass protecting the piece with a power tool before snatching gold and ivory figurines as well as emerald decorations from the piece.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gigantic piece comprises 138 figures encrusted with diamonds and rubies set in marble of various shades and alabaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they fled on their motorbikes, the gang sowed spikes across the road to hobble two pursuing vehicles, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a great loss for Paray-le-Monial and for national heritage", mayor Nesme said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff and around 20 visitors present on the museum's ground floor had been "traumatised" by the violent intrusion, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hieron Museum, one of France's oldest for sacred art, has previously been targeted by thieves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two gold crowns were stolen in 2017, while there was another attempted robbery in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's theft came a day after several precious objects including ornate snuffboxes were stolen from a central Paris museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad daylight robbery saw thieves break into a display case with axes and baseball bats in full view of visitors and staff at the Cognacq-Jay museum. (AFP)

    COP29 draft proposes rich nations pay US$250bn a year

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new draft of a global climate agreement released on Friday at COP29 in Azerbaijan proposes that developed countries provide US$250 billion annually by 2035 to help poorer countries fight global warming.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time a concrete number has been formally proposed at the UN climate talks in Baku, and comes on the final day of a summit dominated by divisions over money.
  <br>
  <br>
  The text sets an ambitious overall target to raise a total of US$1.3 trillion a year by 2035, with the money from rich governments at the core of funding that would be coupled with private-sector investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nearly 200 nations at COP29 had struggled to agree on a new goal that boosted assistance for developing nations to cut emissions and adapt to climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing pledge committed wealthy nations most responsible historically for global warming to provide US$100 billion a year in climate finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  An influential negotiation bloc of 134 developing nations including China has demanded at least five times that figure from developed countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major contributors such as the European Union had said such demands were politically unrealistic and that private-sector money must play a large part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many countries have also pushed at COP29 for a redoubling of efforts to cut planet-heating emissions, something opposed by the Arab Group of nations which does not want fossil fuels singled out. (AFP)

    Nearly 5 tonnes of cocaine seized at Antwerp port

<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgian authorities said on Friday they had seized almost five tonnes of cocaine stashed in shipping containers at Antwerp port, as part of a cross-border investigation into a drug trafficking ring.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said eight people were detained following searches carried out in Belgium and the Netherlands earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The inspections led to the seizure of 185,000 euros (US$193,000) in cash as well as weapons, jewellery, luxury handbags, watches and 4.78 tonnes of cocaine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe focused on a criminal organisation involved in trafficking cocaine to Belgium from South America, Central America and Canada, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group allegedly facilitated the clearing of suspicious containers in the port of Antwerp and, in return for payment, provided logistical assistance to other organisations, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antwerp's port is one of the major gateways for drugs smuggled from South America to the European market, and busts in and around the vast facility occur frequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cocaine seizures there hit a record 116 tonnes last year. (AFP)

    Australian teen dies from suspected methanol poisoning

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian teenager died on Thursday after drinking alcohol contaminated with methanol in Laos, Thai police and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, the fourth foreign national now suspected to have died in the incident.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bianca Jones, 19, fell ill last week in Vang Vieng, a town in the Southeast Asian nation popular with foreign backpackers that is about two hours north of the capital Vientiane by road.
  <br>
  <br>
  She died on Thursday after being taken to a hospital in neighbouring Thailand on November 13, police in the city of Udon Thani said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The physician who examined her said the cause of death was a methanol poisoning, from fake liquor," Phattanawong Chanphon, a police official in the Thai city, told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount of methanol in her body was high, leading to swelling of the brain."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian media said Jones was the fourth foreign tourist to die after consuming the contaminated alcohol, following two Danes and an American.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is every parent's worst fear and a nightmare no one should have to endure," Albanese told parliament on Thursday. "All Australians offer them our deepest sympathy in this time of heartbreak."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones' friend Holly Bowles, also 19, is in critical condition and on life support, her father Shaun Bowles told reporters outside Bangkok Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurious liquor is a problem in Laos, with the governments of Australia and Britain warning citizens to be cautious when taking drinks there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Methanol is a toxic alcohol that is used industrially as a solvent, pesticide, and alternative fuel source, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bowles and Jones stayed at the Nana Backpackers Hostel in Vang Vieng last week and drank at the hostel’s bar before they went out for the evening, Australian media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  They failed to check out on November 13, when hostel staff rushed the pair to the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vietnamese manager of the hostel has been detained for questioning, the Laos tourist police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No charges have been made, however, as police are still "investigating," an official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. (Agencies)

    Duct-taped banana sells for US$6.2m at auction

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A piece of conceptual art consisting of a simple banana, duct-taped to a wall, sold for US$6.2 million at an auction in New York on Wednesday, with the winning bid coming from a prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Comedian," by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was a phenomenon when it debuted in 2019 at Art Basel Miami Beach, as festivalgoers tried to make out whether the single yellow piece of fruit affixed to a white wall with silver duct tape was a joke or cheeky commentary on art collectors. At one point, performance artist David Datuna took the banana off the wall and ate it, saying he felt "hungry" while inspecting it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece attracted so much attention that it had to be withdrawn from view. But three editions sold for between US$120,000 and US$150,000, according to the gallery handling sales at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five years later, Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON, has now paid more than 40 times that higher price point at the Sotheby’s auction. Or, more accurately, Sun purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives him the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it "Comedian".
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece attracted  attention at the auction at Sotheby's, with attendees in the crowded room holding up phones to take photos as two handlers wearing white gloves stood at both sides of the banana, which was bought from a Bangladeshi fruit seller on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, according to The New York Times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bidding started at US$800,000 and within minutes shot up to US$2 million, then US$3 million, then $4 million, and higher, as the auctioneer, Oliver Barker, joked "Don't let it slip away."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Don’t miss this opportunity," Barker said. "These are words I've never thought I'd say: Five million dollars for a banana."
  <br>
  <br>
  The final hammer price announced in the room was US$5.2 million, which did not include the about US$1 million in auction house fees, paid by the buyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Sun said the piece "represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community". But he said the latest version of "Comedian" will not last long.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additionally, in the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sotheby’s calls Cattelan "among Contemporary Art’s most brilliant provocateurs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has persistently disrupted the art world’s status quo in meaningful, irreverent, and often controversial ways," the auction house said in a description of "Comedian".
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for other works such as a golden toilet called "America", Cattelan has explained the banana work as a critical commentary on the art market, which he has criticised in the past for being speculative and failing to help artists. (AP/AFP)

 The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant, as well as a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, the court said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In their decision to grant the warrants, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for starvation in Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  The warrant for Al-Masri lists charges of mass killings during the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that triggered the Gaza war, including rape and the taking of hostages. The prosecution indicated it would continue to gather information with respect to his reported death.
  <br>
  <br>
  ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced on May 20 that he was seeking arrest warrants for alleged crimes connected to the Hamas-led attacks on Israel and the Israeli military response in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza. Israel has said it killed Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, in an airstrike but Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied this.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett said the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were a "mark of shame" for the court. Israel's main opposition leader Yair Lapid also denounced the court's move, calling it "a reward for terrorism".
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu or Gallant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli and Hamas leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court does not have its own police force to carry out arrests and relies on its member states for that. ICC members include all European Union countries, Britain, Japan, Brazil, Australia and Canada, and in the Middle East region the Palestinian territories and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC said Israel's acceptance of the court's jurisdiction was not required. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain has imposed a travel ban and an asset freeze on Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos under its global anti-corruption sanctions regime, the British government said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dos Santos, whose father Jose Eduardo dos Santos ruled Angola for 38 years until 2017, has faced corruption accusations in Angola and elsewhere for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Africa's first female billionaire denies the allegations and says she is the target of a long-running political vendetta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said dos Santos misappropriated more than 50 million pounds (US$63.19 million) for her own financial benefit while she run Angolan state oil firm Sonangol.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said she misappropriated more than 300 million pounds while she was director of telecoms company Unitel .
  <br>
  <br>
  Dos Santos lost an appeal to overturn an order freezing up to 580 million pounds of her assets in September as part a lawsuit at London's High Court brought by Unitel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global police agency Interpol confirmed in 2022 it had issued a red notice for dos Santos, who says she lives in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British government has added seven other designations targeting other individuals under the same global anti-corruption case. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Texas authorities have offered the incoming Trump administration land on the border with Mexico to build "deportation facilities" in support of the president-elect's plan for the mass removal of undocumented migrants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Incoming president Donald Trump said this week he planned to declare a national emergency on border security and use the US military to carry out the mass deportation of undocumented migrants after taking office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the Texas General Land Office announced that commissioner Dawn Buckingham has offered him more than 1,400 acres (570 hectares) of public land on the US southern border "to aid his administration in carrying out their deportation plans".
  <br>
  <br>
  The plot of land is a ranch along the Rio Grande river -- serving as a border between the United States and Mexico -- in Starr county. It was acquired by the office in late October, the statement from the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a letter dated Tuesday, Buckingham said she had authorized a 1.5-mile easement on the ranch to allow "the Texas Border Wall to be built" after the land was acquired.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her office was "fully prepared" to work with US federal agencies to "allow a facility to be built for the processing, detention, and coordination of the largest deportation of violent criminals in the nation's history."
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump has repeatedly railed against undocumented migrants during the election campaign, blaming them for "poisoning the blood" of the country and highlighting violent crimes perpetrated by members of the migrant community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before his first term as president, he had pledged to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, but the project was never completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, said he would "marshal every lever of power to secure the border", according to US broadcaster ABC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities estimate that about 11 million people are living in the United States illegally -- many fleeing violence or economic troubles in their countries and looking for a better life in America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's deportation plan is expected to impact around 20 million families. (AFP)

    Former UK deputy PM John Prescott dies aged 86

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 John Prescott, deputy prime minister to Britain's Tony Blair during his 10 years in government, has died aged 86 after a battle with Alzheimer's, his family said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prescott, who served under Blair from 1997 to 2007, was known as a plain-speaking politician who bridged the divide between the traditional left-wing and the modernisers in the Labour Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dubbed an old-school political "bruiser", he famously punched a member of the public during an election campaign in 2001, after he had been hit by an egg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, it would have all been better if it hadn't happened," Blair said at the time. But added: "John is John".
  <br>
  <br>
  Prescott was born on May 31, 1938, in a seaside house in Wales. His father was a railway signalman, his mother a maid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aged 17, he went to sea as a steward on a luxury cruise ship where boxing bouts were organised among the crew to entertain the passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He went into politics after coming ashore and he attended Oxford's Ruskin College, which offered courses for mature students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prescott entered parliament in 1970 and worked his way up the ranks, becoming a key player in the Labour Party's historic three election victories from 1997 to 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  He acted as a peace broker in the often fraught relationship between Blair and his future successor, Gordon Brown, and was later called "Two Jags" after he used his ministerial car for a 200 yard journey, which he said was needed to prevent his wife's hair from being blown about in the wind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blair said he was devastated by the news.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics; one of the most committed and loyal; and definitely the most unusual," he said. "There was nothing about John which fitted conventional wisdom. (Reuters)

    Indian tycoon Adani charged in US over fraud

<img alt="Gautam Adani has been rocked in recent years by corporate fraud allegations and a stock crash. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780208_1_20241121114142.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Billionaire Indian industrialist Gautam Adani has been charged with paying hundreds of millions of dollars of bribes and hiding the payments from investors, US prosecutors said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With a business empire spanning coal, airports, cement and media, the chairman of Adani Group has been rocked in recent years by corporate fraud allegations and a stock crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The close ally of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow Gujarat native, is alleged to have agreed to pay more than US$250 million in bribes to Indian officials for lucrative solar energy supply contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deals were projected to generate more than US$2 billion in profits after tax, over roughly 20 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  None of the multiple defendants in the case, including Adani, are in custody, the prosecutor's office told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors say one of Adani's alleged accomplices meticulously tracked bribe payments, using his phone to log the bungs offered to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This indictment alleges schemes to pay over US$250 million in bribes to Indian government officials, to lie to investors and banks to raise billions of dollars, and to obstruct justice," said US Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Gautam Adani and seven other business executives allegedly bribed the Indian government to finance lucrative contracts designed to benefit their businesses... while still other defendants allegedly attempted to conceal the bribery conspiracy by obstructing the government's investigation," said the FBI's James Dennehy.
  <br>
  <br>
  A self-described introvert, Adani keeps a low profile and rarely speaks to the media, often sending lieutenants to front corporate events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adani was born in Ahmedabad, Gujarat state, to a middle-class family but dropped out of school at 16 and moved to financial capital Mumbai to find work in the city's lucrative gem trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a short stint in his brother's plastics business, he launched the flagship family conglomerate that bears his name in 1988 by branching out into the export trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  His big break came seven years later with a contract to build and operate a commercial shipping port in Gujarat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adani Group's rapid expansion into capital-intensive businesses previously raised alarms, with Fitch subsidiary and market researcher CreditSights warning in 2022 it was "deeply over-leveraged."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023 a bombshell report from US investment firm Hindenburg Research claimed the conglomerate had engaged in a "brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hindenburg said a pattern of "government leniency towards the group" stretching back decades had left investors, journalists, citizens and politicians unwilling to challenge its conduct "for fear of reprisal." (AFP)

    US defends decision to supply landmines to Ukraine

<img alt="The US-supplied mines can self-destruct or render themselves inactive after losing battery charge – in theory limiting the risk to civilians. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780181_1_20241121091910.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US decision to send anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine – in a major policy shift – was triggered by a change in Russian battlefield tactics favouring infantry over mechanised units, US Defence Secretary Loyd Austin said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "They don't lead with their mechanised forces any more," Austin told reporters while on a visit to Laos. "They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanised forces."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainians "have a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Joe Biden's reversal of his previous curbs on US landmines comes just days after Washington gave Ukraine the green light to use US-made long-range missiles on targets within Russia, as the outgoing administration aims to give Kyiv the upper hand before President-elect Donald Trump enters office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden in 2022 said the United States would mostly ban its use of landmines, at the time specifically drawing a contrast with Russia's use of the weapons in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reversal comes amid concerns about the incoming Trump administration's lack of support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is entering office having repeatedly criticised US assistance for Ukraine, claiming he could secure a ceasefire within hours – comments that have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about Ukraine's ability to withstand the Russian attacks without American support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Russia and the United States – neither of which are signatories to the UN Mine Ban Treaty – have been criticised for their past use of anti-personnel mines in the past. Ukraine is a signatory of the treaty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Austin said the US-supplied mines would be so-called "nonpersistent" mines that can self-destruct or render themselves inactive after losing battery charge – in theory limiting the risk to civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Moscow and Kyiv are jockeying to secure battlefield advantage before Trump assumes office next January.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week, Kyiv fired US-supplied ATACMS missiles at Russian territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree lowering the threshold for when Russia could use nuclear weapons. (AFP)

    President Xi Jinping begins state visit to Brazil

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called for "more voices" to end the Ukraine war and a ceasefire in Gaza, as he conducted a state visit to Brazil's capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said Xi wanted to see "more voices committed to peace to pave the way for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis" and "a ceasefire and an end to the war at an early date" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the appeal during a state visit to Brasilia, where he was hosted by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Brasilia have advanced a joint roadmap for peace in Ukraine that has been endorsed by Moscow but rejected by Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a world plagued by armed conflicts and political strife, China and Brazil put peace, diplomacy and dialogue first," Lula said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's appeal for a halt to fighting in Gaza - where Israel is pressing an offensive against Hamas - echoed one he and the other G20 leaders made during a summit held Monday and Tuesday in Rio.
  <br>
  <br>
  That summit's joint statement called for a "comprehensive" ceasefire in both Gaza and Lebanon, where Israel is also waging an offensive against the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's state visit to Brasilia showcased closer relations between the biggest economies in Asia and Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders signed 35 cooperation accords on areas including agriculture, trade, technology and environmental protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China-Brazil relations "are at their best in history" and the two countries are now "reliable friends," according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula said he looked forward to welcoming Xi to Brazil again next July for a Brics summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit to Brazil's capital comes fresh off his attendance at a G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, and an Apec summit last week in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese leader figured prominently at both summits, in contrast with outgoing US President Joe Biden, who cut a spectral figure as fellow leaders looked past him, politically, to the coming presidency of Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  That difference also spoke to China's ascendant role as a trade partner and investor in Latin America, and expectations that America under Trump will erect trade and migration barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula welcomed Xi with full honours, greeting him on the red carpet as horse-mounted guards rode past, a military brass band played their national anthems, and lines of children waved Chinese and Brazilian flags. (Agencies)

 Pope Francis on Wednesday said he will canonise Carlo Acutis next April, setting the eagerly awaited date for the late teenager to become the Catholic Church’s first millennial and digital-era saint.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis made the announcement at the end of his weekly general audience on Wednesday, saying he would proclaim the church's youngest contemporary saint during the Jubilee of Adolescents at the Vatican on April 25-27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials later confirmed the canonisation Mass would occur on April 27 at the Vatican.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acutis, who was born to Italian parents in London, was a web designer who died of leukaemia in Italy in 2006 at the age of 15. Francis beatified him in 2020 in Assisi, where his tomb draws a steady stream of pilgrims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touted as the “patron saint of the internet,” Acutis used his natural tech talent to create a website to catalog miracles and took care of websites for some local Catholic organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis announced in May that he had approved a second miracle attributed to Acutis’ intercession, paving the way for Wednesday’s announcement. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Wednesday called on its Western allies not to fuel tensions inside the country, after a string of embassies in Kyiv announced they would close, citing the threat of a "massive air attack" on the capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  The warnings of fresh strikes come as Moscow looks to retaliate against Ukraine for firing US-supplied long-range missiles at Russian territory for the first time and with the Kremlin accusing outgoing US President Joe Biden of dragging out the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has already ramped up a wave of deadly missile strikes in recent days, targeting residential areas and Ukraine's energy grid. Air alerts blare out across the country daily.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States led the wave of closures, saying it was shutting its Kyiv office to the public after having received "specific information of a potential significant air attack" on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not provide further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece, Hungary, Italy and Spain – all Nato members – followed suit, announcing the closures of their diplomatic premises in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian officials criticised the rare move and called on its allies not to spread yet more fear among Ukrainian society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv said the "information" the US was referring to looked to be a "psychological operation" launched by Moscow in a bid to destabilise the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remind you that the threat of strikes by the aggressor state has unfortunately been a daily reality for Ukrainians for over 1,000 days," Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nerves are already frayed in Kyiv after almost three years of war, and Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has injected fresh uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has repeatedly criticised US support for Ukraine and claimed he could broker a ceasefire within hours – comments that have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about Ukraine's ability to withstand the Russian attacks without American support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Ukraine and Russia are jockeying for the upper hand on the battlefield before he re-enters the White House in January. (AFP)

<img alt='US Director Joel Souza - author of the "Rust" movie, talks during an AFP interview at Camerimage film festival in Torun, Poland.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Western "Rust" will get its world premiere on Wednesday at a Polish film festival, three years after its cinematographer was killed in a tragic on-set shooting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hollywood star Alec Baldwin was accused of violating basic gun safety rules in the 2021 death of Halyna Hutchins, but his involuntary manslaughter trial collapsed earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hutchins's mother refused to attend the premiere "when there is still no justice for my daughter".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologise to me and take responsibility for her death," Olga Solovey said Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, will introduce the movie at the Camerimage film festival -- known for celebrating cinematography -- in Torun, northern Poland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the "massive devastation" of the shooting left him an emotional wreck.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Rust' just became this sort of insane hurricane," he told AFP. "You're just left to sort of pick up the pieces."
  <br>
  <br>
  The filmmaker admitted that he agonised over whether to complete the movie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely on the fence... There was a time when I thought I just didn't want to make movies anymore," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said what convinced him to finish it was learning that Hutchins's husband wanted her final work to be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Camerimage said it was also Hutchins's "dream" to have her work shown at the festival, but that "Baldwin will not be there".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Emmy-winning actor was holding a revolver during a rehearsal on set in New Mexico when a live round was fired, fatally wounding 42-year-old Hutchins.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a tragic irony, the film centres on an accidental killing -- a parallel that Souza called "unsettling".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a strange one to unpack. When people hear about it, they generally fall silent for a few moments because they can't believe" it, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Souza and Baldwin developed the script from research Souza was doing on the youngest person ever to be hanged in the Old West.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rust" tells the story of an outlaw who rides to rescue his 13-year-old grandson from execution for an accident being treated as murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter for accidentally loading Baldwin's prop gun with a live round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baldwin's own trial spectacularly collapsed in July when it emerged that prosecutors had not turned over a batch of bullets that detectives had found during their investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Filming was halted by the fatal incident, but completed last year on location in Montana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hutchins, a former journalist who grew up in Ukraine, had been named as one of the industry's rising stars in 2019 by American Cinematographer magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the tragedy prompted some calls for banning firearms from sets altogether, new Hollywood guidelines now specify that only an armourer can hand a weapon to an actor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said Baldwin was handed the gun on set by the film's first assistant director, who later pleaded guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Souza said "the safety bulletin doesn't go quite far enough. I think they should mandate that no real weapons be used."
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Rust" premiere is not the only controversy at the festival, whosejury is presided over this year by Oscar winner Cate Blanchett.
  <br>
  <br>
  French director Coralie Fargeat pulled her movie starring Demi Moore, "The Substance" -- which won best screenplay at Cannes -- "after discovering the highly misogynistic and offensive words" of festival founder Marek Zydowicz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zydowicz was forced to apologise after appearing to suggest that including more women cinematographers might lead to "mediocre film production" in the line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remarks, for which Zydowicz later apologised, also led Oscar-winning director British director Steve McQueen, a double Oscar winner for "12 Years A Slave", to also stay away in protest at what he called the "deeply offensive words". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Thai woman was sentenced to death on Wednesday for poisoning a friend with cyanide, in the first of her 14 murder trials.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sararat Rangsiwuthaporn, 36, an online gambling addict, is accused of swindling thousands of dollars from her victims before killing them with the chemical.
  <br>
  <br>
  A court in Bangkok convicted her on Wednesday for fatally poisoning her friend Siriporn Kanwong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two met up near Bangkok in April last year to release fish into the Mae Klong river as part of a Buddhist ritual.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siriporn collapsed and died shortly afterwards and investigators found traces of cyanide in her body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were then able to link Sararat to previously unsolved cyanide poisonings going back as far as 2015, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The court's decision is just," Siriporn's mother, Tongpin Kiatchanasiri, told reporters following the verdict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to tell my daughter that I miss her deeply, and justice has been done for her today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said Sararat funded her gambling addiction by borrowing money from her victims -- in one case as much as 300,000 baht (nearly US$9,000) -- before killing them and stealing their jewellery and mobile phones.
  <br>
  <br>
  She lured 15 people -- one of whom survived -- to take poisoned "herb capsules", they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sararat faces 13 more separate murder trials, and has been charged with around 80 offences in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her ex-husband -- a police lieutenant-colonel -- was given 16 months in prison and her former lawyer two years for complicity in Siriporn's killing, the lawyer for the victim's family said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand has been the scene of several sordid and high-profile criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this year, six foreigners were found dead in a luxury Bangkok hotel after a cyanide poisoning believed to be connected to debts worth millions of baht. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean super producer behind the chart-topping girl band NewJeans resigned from her label Wednesday, following a protracted legal battle with BTS's agency HYBE that has rocked the country's K-pop industry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Min Hee-jin announced her departure in a statement following what she called a "hellish dispute with HYBE" and vowed legal action against the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The saga began in April, when HYBE launched an audit of subsidiary ADOR -- NewJeans' label -- and attempted to push Min out, accusing her of breach of trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move sparked a sprawling legal and PR battle, with Min accusing HYBE of copying her star-making formula for a competing girl band, which has seen the boardroom workings of K-pop hashed out in South Korean courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Min slammed HYBE's action against her as a "witch hunt" in a statement Wednesday, saying she would take "necessary legal actions" against the company and individuals over the dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she would embark on "new K-pop journey" in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Min, who joined the industry in the early 2000s, is widely regarded as one of the most successful producers in K-pop, having worked with stars such as Girls' Generation, EXO and SHINee.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans, a K-pop phenomenon that made its debut in 2022 and whose members are all under 20, is among HYBE's most successful K-pop groups along with BTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has topped global charts, including the Billboard 200, and broke the Guinness World Record last year for "Fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify".
  <br>
  <br>
  The members of NewJeans have publicly shown full support for Min and demanded that she be reinstated as ADOR's CEO at a livestream in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The girl group also sent a formal legal notice to HYBE last week, demanding six specific actions, including reinstating Min, and warning that failure to meet them could lead to the termination of their exclusive contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  ADOR said in a statement Wednesday that it was "regrettable that Min unilaterally notified us of her resignation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "ADOR will continue to provide our fullest support to NewJeans to help them grow and thrive even further," it said. (AFP)

    Death-row drug convict to be sent back to Philippines

<img alt="Family members of drug trafficking inmate Mary Jane Veloso hold placards pleading for help. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780123_2_20241120193418.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Wednesday that a deal has been reached for Indonesia to send home a Filipino death-row drug convict who was nearly executed by firing squad but got a reprieve due to years of pleadings from Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  Marcos thanked Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and his government for granting a longstanding Philippine request for Mary Jane Veloso to be brought back home to serve her sentence in her country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Mary Jane Veloso is coming home,” Marcos said in a statement. “Arrested in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death, Mary Jane’s case has been a long and difficult journey.”
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear when Veloso would be flown back to the Philippines, but Marcos said he looked forward to welcoming her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Law, Human Rights and Immigration, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, confirmed that Subianto has given his approval for Veloso's return to the Philippines. That may happen in December, as long as conditions were met, including her continued detention in her country as part of the Indonesian court's sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines should also shoulder the costs of her repatriation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said at a news conference in Manila that Filipino authorities would discuss the legal terms of Veloso's transfer with their Indonesian counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indonesian government has asked the Department of Justice in Manila to formally request Veloso's transfer back to the Philippines, Justice Department spokesperson Mico Clavano said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision, Marcos said, “is a reflection of the depth our nation’s partnership with Indonesia — united in a shared commitment to justice and compassion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso's transfer would remove the possibility of her facing an execution because the Philippines, Asia’s largest Roman Catholic nation, has long abolished the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2015, Indonesian authorities moved Veloso to an island prison where she and eight other drug convicts were scheduled to be executed by firing squad despite objections from the convicts' home countries, including Australia, Brazil, France, Ghana and Nigeria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia executed the eight other convicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso’s case has caused a public outcry in the Philippines, where her family and supporters contend she is innocent and was unaware that 2.6 kilograms of heroin was concealed in her suitcase. The drugs were discovered when she entered Indonesia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso travelled to Indonesia in 2010 where her godsister reportedly told her a job as a domestic worker awaited her. Her godsister also allegedly provided the suitcase where the prohibited drugs were found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine authorities had filed criminal complaints, including for human trafficking, against illegal Filipino recruiters who arranged for Veloso to work in Indonesia, Clavano said. She added that she would serve as a crucial witness in the trial of the suspects when she returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  That Philippine case helped convince Indonesian authorities to delay Veloso's execution and eventually consider her transfer back to her country, Clavano said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos said Veloso’s story resonated with many in the Philippines, as “a mother trapped by the grip of poverty, who made one desperate choice that altered the course of her life."
  <br>
  <br>
  “While she was held accountable under Indonesian law, she remains a victim of her circumstances," Marcos said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines has been a global source of manual labour, including many impoverished women who abandon their families for higher-paying jobs and better opportunities abroad. Alarming abuse, especially of Filipina house helpers, has prompted Philippine authorities to impose restrictions and safeguards but many continue to be exploited.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 59 Filipinos around the world face the death penalty mostly for drug and murder convictions, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump nominated Linda McMahon, former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, on Tuesday to lead the Department of Education, which he has pledged to abolish.
 <br>
  <br>
  He described McMahon as a "fierce advocate for Parents' Rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  McMahon is a co-chair of Trump's transition team ahead of his return to the White House in January. It is tasked with filling some 4,000 positions in the government.

  Regarding McMahon's experience in education, Trump cited her two-year stint on the Connecticut Board of Education and 16 years on the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University, a private Catholic school.
  <br>
  <br>
  McMahon left WWE in 2009 to run for a seat in the US Senate, and has been a major donor to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2021, she has chaired the Centre For The American Worker at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the election campaign Trump promised to do away with the federal education department when he returns to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I say it all the time. I'm dying to get back to do this. We will ultimately eliminate the federal Department of Education," he said in September during a rally in Wisconsin.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Republican convention in Milwaukee, McMahon said she was "privileged to call Donald Trump a colleague and a boss," as well as "a friend."
  <br>
  <br>
  Her ties with Trump go back to her years in the professional wrestling industry -- she said she first met him as chief executive at WWE.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2017, she was confirmed as the head of the Small Business Administration, which is responsible for supporting America's millions of small businesses, which employ around half the country's private-sector workforce.
  <br>
  <br>
  In nominating her, Trump pointed to her experience in business, helping to grow the WWE.
  <br>
  <br>
  After leaving the administration, she served as chair of the pro-Trump America First Action SuperPAC, or political action committee. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Internet Conference officially got underway in Wuzhen of Zhejiang province on Wednesday, with President Xi Jinping calling for faster innovative and secure development of cyberspace to create a better digital future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit — the country's biggest internet forum — focuses on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking via a video link, Xi said the new technology had brought both opportunities and unpredictable challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  “New technologies, like AI, are flourishing. This has greatly enhanced humanity's capacity to understand and shape the world we live in, and at the same time presented us with a series of unpredictable risks and challenges,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China would work with other countries in information revolution and development to harness the internet’s potential for greater global benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China stands ready to work with all countries to seize the historical initiative in information revolution and development, and build a community with a shared future in cyberspace, so that together we can enable the internet to deliver greater benefits to the people and to the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang said the country's cutting-edge technologies had delivered fruitful outcomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So far, China has put in place the world's largest network infrastructure with advanced technology and the internet has been available to 78 percent of the population.” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding proposed four points for building a shared future in cyberspace, including improving global governance, strengthening tech collaboration, promoting fairness and universal benefits in internet use, and upholding laws and regulations for cybersecurity protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concluding his speech, the vice premier and Politburo Standing Committee member expressed hopes for active dialogue during the summit to build a shared future in cyberspace.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Artificial intelligence is playing a bigger role in peacekeeping with real-time AI translation making it easier for nations to communicate, says Unesco’s chair in AI and data science for society.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lampros Stergioulas, who is attending the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, says he hopes this year’s summit can address both the benefits and risks of using AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect to see some agreements about cross-border data exchanges and at least some agreements in principle on data exchange standards that can be used for AI training,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Also] agreement on exchange of information because it's important to have open exchange of these developments, otherwise we will go into very dangerous territory as a planet.”
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit - the country's biggest annual internet forum - focuses on AI and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  On its impact on diplomacy, Stergioulas said AI translation applications can ensure, “diplomatic affairs and dialogue between nations happen in a more immediate and constructive manner.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hague University of Applied Sciences scholar added that AI-powered tools, such as drones and robots, could help support humanitarian missions in conflict and disaster zones.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Drones can be also used to deliver aid and relief and resources to people that need it very quickly. The same with robots in the ground or dangerous zones, for example. We need to build a lot more infrastructure on that and not just focus on the military use," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Stergioulas admitted that the new technology was a double-edged sword, stressing the need for AI ethics and regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example drones used in warfare... there's a lot of development of autonomous weapons and some concerns there really from almost every country and almost every army in the world, so there are some great challenges we need to be aware of,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, Unesco pioneered a globally-accepted AI ethics framework which aims to keep AI safe and secure and under human control.

    SpaceX fails to repeat Starship booster catch

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Donald Trump attended the launch as a guest of Elon Musk. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779999_1_20241120073943.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX's Starship mega-rocket blasted off on its latest test flight on Tuesday, with US President-elect Donald Trump joining Elon Musk to witness the spectacle firsthand in the latest sign of their ever-closer ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican leader was deprived of the chance to see the booster stage caught in the launch tower's "chopstick" arms, an engineering marvel demonstrated by the company last month and one he personally lauded during his election victory speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, the colossal Super Heavy first stage made a more subdued splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Company representatives cited unmet technical criteria, dampening the triumph of an event attended by a bevvy of Trump-world figures, including Donald Trump Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Trump greeted Musk warmly on Tuesday afternoon, sporting a red Maga hat as the pair headed off to watch from the control tower of the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, where the rocket blasted off at 4pm local time (2200 GMT) on the sixth test flight for Starship.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX founder and CEO Musk has been a constant presence at Trump's side since the incoming president's election victory, joining him at a meeting with Argentina's President Javier Milei and even at a UFC bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's decision to travel to Musk's home turf was the latest sign of the growing alliance between the billionaire duo, which has raised questions over possible conflicts of interests given SpaceX's lucrative contracts with Nasa and the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's launch marked the quickest turnaround between test flights for the world's most powerful rocket, a gleaming, 121-metre-tall stainless steel colossus central to Musk's ambition of colonising Mars and making humanity a multiplanetary species.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk aims to launch the first uncrewed missions to the Red Planet as early as 2026, coinciding with the next "Mars transfer window" – a period when the journey between Earth and Mars is at its shortest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa is also counting on a specialised version of Starship to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface later this decade under its Artemis program.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flight six of Starship was seen as a test of whether SpaceX's first booster catch was pure precision or relied on a stroke of luck after Musk – perhaps inadvertently – disclosed how close the last flight came to disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a clip posted to X showcasing his gaming chops in "Diablo IV," sharp-eared fans caught an employee briefing him that the Super Heavy booster was "one second away" from a system failure that could have spelt catastrophe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starship's upper stage will make a partial orbit of Earth, re-enter the atmosphere and splash down in the Indian Ocean a little over an hour later, but this time in the daylight, providing clearer visuals for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key milestones include reigniting Starship's Raptor engines for the first time in space and trialling new heat shield materials. The flight also carries Starship's first ever payload – a stuffed banana – and serves as a swan song for the current generation of Starship prototypes.
  <br>
  <br>
  With twice the thrust of the Saturn V rockets that powered Apollo missions, Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built. Musk has already teased that its successor, Starship V3, will be "3X more powerful" and could take flight within a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight comes as Musk is riding high on Trump's November 5 White House win, having campaigned extensively for the returning Republican leader, as well as donating staggering sums from his own fortune to the cause.
  <br>
  <br>
  His loyalty has paid off. Musk has been tapped to co-lead a new "Department of Government Efficiency" – or Doge, a cheeky nod to the meme-based cryptocurrency Musk loves to promote.
  <br>
  <br>
  That in turn has led to concerns Musk could engage in "self-dealing" as the CEO is poised to straddle the line between government insider and corporate titan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics worry he could sway regulatory decisions to benefit his six companies, including SpaceX and its marquee Starship programme, which has faced launch delays linked to an environmental review the company called "superfluous." (AFP)

 Ukraine fired six US-made ATACMS missiles at Russia’s Bryansk region, Russia’s defence ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine claimed it hit a military weapons depot in Bryansk in the middle of the night, though it didn't specify what weapons it used. The Ukrainian General Staff said that multiple explosions and detonation were heard in the targeted area.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, the Russian defence ministry said the military shot down five Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, and damaged one more.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fragments fell on the territory of an unspecified military facility, the ministry said. The falling debris sparked a fire, but didn’t inflict any damage or casualties, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither side's claims could be independently verified. (AP)

    British farmers protest against inheritance tax

<img alt="Demonstrators listen to speakers during a farmers' protest against changes to inheritance tax rules for land ownership. Photos: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779952_1_20241119211208.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British farmers massed in London on Tuesday, calling on the Labour government to scrap plans to change inheritance tax rules for land ownership, which they say threatens the agriculture sector and food production.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tractors with banners calling the move "the final straw" for the beleaguered sector drove around Parliament Square, while farmers lobbied lawmakers and others called for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's administration to think again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've brought thousands of farmers to London to explain to the government that farmers are food producers, and this ludicrous budget is going to put us all out of business," farmer Olly Harrison told AFP from the protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Farmers just simply will pack up... it's just too much for us -- we've just had enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Although on a smaller scale, the demonstrations are reminiscent of protests when an earlier Labour government incensed rural communities in the early 2000s with a plan to ban foxhunting with dogs in England and Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2002, countryside campaigners estimated that 400,000 people marched through London to oppose the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Farmers Union president Tom Bradshaw, said the latest protests would continue for as long as it takes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They (the government) cannot have a policy in place which has such disastrous human impacts and think we're going to go quiet," he told Sky News television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bradshaw met Environment Secretary Steve Reed on Monday and said afterwards he had shown a "level of understanding".
  <br>
  <br>
  But both sides appear to be digging in, as the new Labour government tries to claw back what it says is a £22-billion (US$28-billion) blackhole in public finances left by the last Conservative administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  In France and other European countries farmers have also been protesting over increased pressure on their revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Central to the row in Britain, where farmers have been struggling due to lack of funding and post-Brexit labour shortages, is how farms could be taxed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farming businesses previously qualified for 100-percent relief on inheritance tax on agricultural and business property, reducing the amounts that farmers and landowners pay when farmland is passed on after a death.
  <br>
  <br>
  From April 6, 2026, however, total exemption from death duties will only apply to the first £1 million (US$1.27 million) of combined agricultural and business property.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any estate valued above that will have to pay a 20-percent tax rate -- half the standard applied to other land and property -- over 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government maintains the actual threshold before paying inheritance tax could be as much as £3 million (US$3.8 million), once exemptions for each partner in a couple and for the farm property are taken into account.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said Monday "the vast majority of farms" will not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the NFU insists that more farms may have to pay the tax when land, property and equipment are taken into account. It points to environment ministry figures that show that 66 percent of farm businesses in England have a net value of more than £1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our numbers suggest that 75 percent of commercial farms, those farms producing this country's food, are caught in the eye of this storm," said Bradshaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farmers fear the financial burden will force farms to be broken up and sold as result of the policy, hitting food production and supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 1,800 farmers lobbied MPs in London on Tuesday, winning support from the opposition Conservative party. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch claimed Labour "clearly doesn't understand or care about rural communities".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tim Farron, environment spokesman for the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats, said direct agricultural subsidies had fallen by 20 percent in real terms since 2015, and 8,100 farms were lost across the country in 2023. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Major EU countries are ready to provide defence and financial aid to Ukraine if the United States reduces support, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking on the 1,000th day of the Russian invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, as foreign ministers from six major European countries held talks in Warsaw dominated by the war and Donald Trump's return to power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top diplomats from France, Germany, Italy and Poland joined the meeting, while Britain's David Lammy and Spain's Jose Manuel Albares took part by video.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I note with appreciation the readiness of the largest European Union countries to assume the burden of military and financial support for Ukraine in the context of a possible reduction in US involvement," Sikorski told reporters after the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warsaw gathering followed a meeting of all EU foreign ministers in Brussels and comes as Trump's return to the White House threatens a drastic change in US policy nearly three years into the Russian attack on Ukraine. (AFP)

 Gisele Pelicot, the French woman drugged by her ex-husband so she could be raped and sexually abused by him and dozens of strangers, said on Tuesday that it was time for a "macho" society to change its attitude on rape.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It's time that the macho, patriarchal society that trivialises rape changes," said Gisele Pelicot in her closing statement at the trial of her ex-husband and dozens of other men on rape charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's time we changed the way we look at rape," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since early September her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot has been in the dock in the southern city of Avignon along with 49 other men. Another defendant is still at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele Pelicot has become a feminist icon by refusing to be ashamed and demanding the trial be open to the public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele, 71, said the marathon hearings marked a trial of "cowardice" on the part of the men who took part in the rapes organised by her husband.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen people take the stand who deny rape, and some who admit it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to say to these men: at what point did Mrs Pelicot give you her consent when you entered the room? At what point do you become aware of this inert body? At what point do you not report it to the police?"
  <br>
  <br>
  None of her abusers alerted the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can hear this gentleman saying 'a finger is not rape'," Gisele Pelicot added, in reference to testimony from another defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have counted around 200 instances of rape, most of them by her husband and more than 90 by strangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele said her former husband "had a lot of fantasies that I couldn't fulfil".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But why did it come to this? I think what he wanted was Mrs Pelicot and not someone else," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As I didn't want to go to a swingers' club, he thought he'd found the solution by putting me to sleep."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've lost 10 years of my life that I'll never make up for," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This scar will never heal."
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial enters its final stages this week. Dominique Pelicot was also set to address the court before the civil parties' deliver their closing arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are then scheduled to give their closing arguments and make their sentencing demands for the defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the couple's three children spoke in court of their heartbreak and grief, with the daughter insisting she has been "forgotten" despite being also abused.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele's daughter, who uses the pen name Caroline Darian, believes she was also assaulted by her father.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case of 71-year-old Dominique Pelicot has sparked horror, protests and a debate about male violence in French society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominique Pelicot has confessed to being a rapist. If convicted, he would emerge from the historic trial with a record as one of France's worst sex offenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the co-defendants, only 14 have admitted the charges of aggravated rape, for which most of them face up to 20 years imprisonment if convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35 others deny having raped Gisele Pelicot and maintain that they thought they were taking part in sex games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele's life was shattered in 2020 when she discovered that her partner of five decades had for years been secretly administering her large doses of tranquilisers to rape her and invite dozens of strangers to join him in their home in the village of Mazan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele Pelicot has said that for years she had strange memory lapses and other health problems and thought she might have had Alzheimer's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many hope that the trial will help victims of sexual violence to finally be listened to and believed, and lead France to inscribe the notion of consent into the definition of rape in French law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One for all," French daily Liberation said on Tuesday, putting a picture of Gisele on its front page and calling the trial "historic."
  <br>
  <br>
  The verdict is expected to be delivered by December 20 at the latest. (AFP)

 The 2024 World Internet Conference, also known as the Wuzhen summit, takes place from November 19 to 22 in Zhejiang province in eastern China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech companies and government officials from around the world gather annually in one of the nation's famous historic water towns - Wuzhen - known for its rivers and canals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched in 2014, China's biggest internet forum brings together global stakeholders to discuss issues, such as tech trends, internet governance and the responsible use of technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a congratulatory note sent to the first Wuzhen Summit, President Xi Jinping said he hoped internet specialists could "improve cooperation and build a safe network", and "reach agreements on global network governance".

    With a theme of "Embracing a People-centred and AI-for-good Digital Future - Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace," this year's summit will focus on artificial intelligence and its impact on the economy and humanity.
    <br>
    <br>
    This year's edition will feature 24 sub-forums on topics such as cybersecurity, digital economy, data governance and the Global Development Initiative.
    <br>
    <br>
    The summit will see the establishment of a special committee on AI, a think tank cooperation programme, and an international digital training institute.
    <br>
    <br>
    There will also be a new award to celebrate outstanding achievements in the field of the global internet.

     What role does Hong Kong play in the Wuzhen talks?
    </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    A number of local tech sector representatives are attending the Wuzhen summit, including IT sector lawmaker Duncan Chiu, who will give a speech about Hong Kong's AI development.

    <br>

     </div>
     <br>
     Chiu told RTHK that the SAR could contribute in many ways with ongoing AI projects in universities and startups.
     <br>
     <br>
     "There are many projects ongoing and in universities, we see there are many teams
     <br>
     working on different application of AI, especially in some vertical sectors, like financial markets and on medical," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "The use of AI for enhancing the research result is also on display in many startup teams in Hong Kong."
     <br>
     <br>
     He added that the city's unique position allows it to bridge global and mainland data guidelines, potentially becoming a leader in cross-border data convergence.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We can do some trials [to test] how to deal with these data safely and usefully and comply to global standards, regulations, laws, and also fit with the mainland law. That will become a very important breakthrough in terms of doing these cross-border data examples," Chiu said.

    Thousands march in NZ Maori rights protest

 Booming Indigenous Maori "haka" chants rang out across New Zealand's capital on Tuesday, as tens of thousands rallied against a conservative push to redefine the nation's founding treaty.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 35,000 demonstrators poured into the city of Wellington, police said, shutting down busy streets as their spirited procession inched its way towards parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bare-chested men draped in traditional feather cloaks were joined by horse riders waving the red, white and black Maori flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children marched alongside adults bearing distinctive full-face Maori "moko" tattoos and clutching ceremonial wooden weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The vibe is beautiful. People of all walks are here to support. It is peaceful and respectful," participant Nick Stewart told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests have been swelling throughout New Zealand after a minor party in the conservative coalition government drafted a bill to redefine the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the bill has almost no chance of passing, its mere introduction has triggered one of New Zealand's largest protests in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many critics -- including some of New Zealand's most respected lawyers -- see it as an attempt to strip long-agreed rights from the country's 900,000 strong Maori population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stand here gathered in our tens of thousands on the steps of parliament to protest this bill for our mokopuna," said Stewart, using a Maori word for future generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds gathered on the lawns outside New Zealand's beehive-shaped parliament building, playing reggae music and giving speeches that urged the government to come out and face them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not the best way to have a conversation. We will not accept unilateral change to a treaty that involves two parties," said Ngira Simmonds, a key advisor to New Zealand's Maori queen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many demonstrators arrived in Wellington after a nine-day "hikoi" -- or protest march -- that began hundreds of kilometres away at New Zealand's northern tip. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Leaders from the Group of 20 major economies on Monday issued a joint statement highlighting the suffering caused by conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, while calling for cooperation on climate change, poverty reduction and tax policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  G20 leaders meeting at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum for a two-day summit tackled an agenda that reflected a shifting global order, trying to shore up multilateral consensus before US President-elect Donald Trump returns to power in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their discussions of trade, climate change and international security will run up against the sharp US policy changes that Trump vows upon taking office, from tariffs to the promise of a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, leaders at the summit were able to reach a narrow consensus on the escalating Ukraine war, focused succinctly on "human suffering" and the economic fallout of the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders' statement also expressed "deep concern about the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip," and called urgently for more aid and protection for civilians along with a comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin did not attend the summit, and Moscow was represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took marathon negotiations over the weekend for diplomats to finalise the joint statement, with debate over climate policy stretching into the dawn hours of Sunday, according to people involved in the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In their statement, leaders agreed the world needs to reach a deal by the end of the United Nations Cop29 climate change summit in Azerbaijan on a new financial goal for how much money rich nations must provide to poorer developing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cop29 officials had called on the G20 leaders for a strong signal to help breach the impasse on climate finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the joint statement said nations need to resolve the issue, they did not indicate what should be the solution at the UN summit set to end on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As host of this year's G20 meetings, Brazil expanded the group's focus on extreme poverty and hunger, while introducing debate on cooperation to fairly tax the world's wealthiest – topics also highlighted in the leaders' joint statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva opened the summit on Monday with the launch of a global alliance to combat poverty and hunger, with backing from more than 80 countries, along with multilateral banks and major philanthropies.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping also took the occasion to announce a raft of measures designed to support the developing economies of the "Global South," from scientific cooperation with Brazil and African nations to lowering trade barriers for least developed countries. (Reuters)

<img alt="President Xi Jinping says Group of 20 leaders should act to help cool the Ukraine crisis. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779796_3_20241119101708.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping urged G20 leaders on Monday to support efforts to de-escalate the war in Ukraine and reach a "political solution," state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The G20 should support the United Nations and its Security Council in playing a greater role, and support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises," Xi said, according to broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for leaders to avoid "spillovers" from battlefields and escalation of fighting, and to help "cool the Ukraine crisis and seek a political solution."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's remarks at the G20 summit in Brazil come shortly after Ukraine reportedly received a US green light to launch long-range missiles provided by Washington against targets inside Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Russia's Foreign Ministry said any use of these missiles by Ukraine to attack Russian territory would mark a radical escalation of the conflict, fundamentally alter the nature of the war and trigger "an adequate and tangible" response from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Xi also called for efforts to shore up multilateral trade systems and warned against politicising economic issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for more international governance and cooperation on AI, saying this should not become "a game of rich countries and the wealthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, the president touted China's support for the developing world and pledged more aid initiatives, including proposing an initiative with three other G20 members to help the Global South gain better access to scientific and technological innovations.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a session on the reform of global governance institutions, Xi warned against protectionism in the name of green and low-carbon development, referring to tariffs on Chinese products like electric vehicles and biodiesel imposed by G20 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve global trade governance and build a world economy characterised by openness," Xi was quoted as saying by Xinhua. (Agencies)

<img alt="Lopburi authorities have tried quelling instances of human-macaque clashes with sterilisation and relocation programs. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779750_1_20241118213246.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in central Thailand said they barricaded themselves into their own station over the weekend, after a menacing mob of 200 escaped monkeys ran riot.
 <br>
  <br>
  The human inhabitants of Lopburi have long suffered from a growing and aggressive monkey population and authorities have built special enclosures to contain groups of the unruly residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Saturday around 200 of the primates broke out and rampaged through town, with one posse descending on a local police station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've had to make sure doors and windows are closed to prevent them from entering the building for food," police captain Somchai Seedee said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was concerned the marauders could destroy property including police documents, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic cops and officers on guard duty were called in to fend off the visitors, the Lopburi police said on Facebook on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around a dozen of the intruders were still perched on the roof of the police station on Monday, photos from local media showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down in the streets, police and local authorities were working to round up individuals, luring them away from residential areas with food.

  While Thailand is an overwhelmingly Buddhist nation, it has long assimilated Hindu traditions and lore from its pre-Buddhist era.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, monkeys are afforded a special place in Thai hearts thanks to the heroic Hindu monkey god Hanuman, who helped Rama rescue his beloved wife Sita from the clutches of an evil demon king.

  <br>
  Thousands of the primates rule the streets around the Pra Prang Sam Yod temple in the centre of Lopburi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The town has been laying on an annual feast of fruit for its population of macaques since the late 1980s, part religious tradition and part tourist attraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their growing numbers, property damage and fights have made for an uneasy coexistence with their human neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopburi authorities have tried quelling instances of human-macaque clashes with sterilisation and relocation programs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Controversial Australian broadcaster and former Wallabies coach Alan Jones has been hit with two additional charges, after being arrested on Monday for a string of alleged historical sex crimes.
 <br>
  <br>
  A police spokesman said the veteran broadcaster was charged with an additional two counts of indecent assault relating to a ninth victim, bringing the total to 26 charges, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault against people that had been employed by Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 83-year-old is a household name across Australia and for years held immense sway through his top-rating radio talk show.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a colourful career, he also coached the national men's rugby team, was a speechwriter for an Australian prime minister, and taught at one of the country's most prestigious schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detectives from a dedicated child abuse squad arrested Jones on Monday while executing a search warrant at his luxury Sydney Harbour apartment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was later released on bail ahead of a court appearance in Sydney.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones has strenuously denied prior allegations of indecent assault which surfaced in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper late last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will allege that the accused knew some of them personally. Some of them professionally," state crime commander Michael Fitzgerald told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest victim was 17 years old at the time of the alleged offending, Fitzgerald said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wish to commend the victims and their bravery in coming forward. They are fully aware, as are the investigators, that the hard work is just beginning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Whether as a sports coach, aspiring politician or radio heavyweight, Jones has spent decades in the public eye.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rose to fame while coaching the Australian rugby side in the 1980s, leading the Wallabies to a rare "grand slam" over England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland.
  <br>
  <br>
  His feats as a coach and administrator earned him a place in Australia's sports hall of fame, where he was inducted in 1989. (Agencies)

    Kremlin warns against use of US long-range missiles

<img alt="Ukraine has long sought authorisation from Washington to use Army Tactical Missile System to hit military installations and airfields inside Russia. File photo: AFP/John Hamilton/US Department of Defence" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779746_1_20241118205717.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday accused US President Joe Biden of escalating the war in Ukraine over reports that he has allowed Kyiv to use long-range missiles supplied by Washington to strike targets inside Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments from Moscow came as Ukraine said a fresh Russian strike on the Black Sea port city of Odesa had killed at least eight people and wounded 18, following a massive weekend attack on the country's creaking energy infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has long sought authorisation from Washington to use the powerful Army Tactical Missile System, known by its initials as ATACMS, to hit military installations – and in particular airfields – inside Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine says it is mainly seeking to use the weapons to prevent Russian aerial bombardments that have levelled entire districts and towns near the front line and decimated energy facilities across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US official spoke about the policy shift on condition of anonymity on Sunday, saying the decision had come in response to Russia's deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to aid its war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps in order to continue fuelling the fire and provoke a further escalation of tensions," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If such a decision was really formulated and announced to the Kyiv regime, then of course it's a qualitatively new spiral of tensions and a qualitatively new situation from the point of view of the US's engagement in the conflict," Peskov added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said President Vladimir Putin had expressed Russia's position clearly in September when the leader said that such a move would put Nato "at war" with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said in September that if Ukraine were to attack Russia with the long-range missiles then Moscow would "take the appropriate decisions based on the threats". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies began arriving on Monday at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum for their annual summit, bracing for a shift in the global order with the return to power of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among them is President Xi Jinping, who arrived in Rio on Sunday for the summit and a state visit to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received the heads of government on a red carpet at the museum where they will meet through Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their discussions of trade, climate change and international security will run up against the sharp US policy changes that Trump vows upon taking office in January, from tariffs to the promise of a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security has been strengthened with troops reinforcing police for the duration of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi has also been meeting with G20 leaders on the sidelines of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the president said Beijing and London "should adopt a rational and objective perspective on each other's development," according to Xinhua News Agency, adding that the two countries should deepen political mutual trust to ensure the steady development of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible, and strengthened dialogue should provide stronger understanding," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first meeting between the leaders of China and the UK since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said "there is no fundamental conflict of interests between China and Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese said there had been "encouraging progress in the stabilisation of our relationship". (Reuters/Xinhua)

<img alt="Sweden took part in Nato's Steadfast Defender exercises in March 2024. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779741_1_20241118201551.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sweden on Monday began sending some five million pamphlets to residents urging them to prepare for the possibility of war, as neighbouring Finland launched a new preparedness website.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both Sweden and Finland dropped decades of military non-alignment to join the US-led military alliance Nato in the wake of Russia's 2022 assault on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of the war, Stockholm has repeatedly urged Swedes to prepare both mentally and logistically for the possibility of war, citing the serious security situation in its vicinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The booklet "If Crisis or War Comes", sent by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), contains information about how to prepare for emergencies such as war, natural disasters, or cyber-attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is an updated version of a pamphlet that Sweden has issued five times since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous version sent out in 2018 made headlines, as it was the first time it had been sent to Swedes since 1961 at the height of the Cold War.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The security situation is serious and we all need to strengthen our resilience to face various crises and ultimately war," MSB director Mikael Frisell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-page document outlines with simple illustrations the threats facing the Nordic nation, including military conflict, natural disasters, and cyber and terror attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It includes tips for preparedness, such as keeping non-perishable food in stock and storing water.
  <br>
  <br>
  MSB said the updated 2024 version had a stronger focus on preparation for war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the next two weeks 5.2 million copies will be sent to Swedish households.
  <br>
  <br>
  The brochure is available in print in both Swedish and English and digital versions are available in several other languages – including Arabic, Farsi, Ukrainian, Polish, Somali and Finnish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweden's former army chief Micael Byden alarmed many of his compatriots in January when he urged them to consider their own preparedness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Swedes have to mentally prepare for war," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Monday, the government in Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometre border with Russia, launched a website gathering information on preparedness for different crises. (AFP)

    Fatalities as typhoon Man-yi lashes the Philippines

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least eight people were killed as super typhoon Man-yi hit the Philippine archipelago over the weekend, unleashing fierce winds and strong rains that triggered landslides and storm surges, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi, the sixth storm to hit the country in a span of one month, made landfall in the eastern province of Catanduanes on Saturday, but weakened as it moved across the main Luzon island and was later downgraded to a typhoon as it exited the landmass on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A family of seven, including an eight-year-old girl, died after a landslide in a northern provincial town in Nueva Vizcaya buried their home, the disaster office in the area said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Daet town in Camarines Norte province, a 72-year-old man was killed in a vehicular accident caused by hanging cables due to the storm's strong winds, the provincial disaster office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One casualty is one casualty too many. So, that is unfortunate," President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told reporters, referring to the death in Camarines Norte. "We will now carry on with the rescue of those isolated areas and the continuing relief for those who have been displaced."
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is approaching Vietnam with maximum sustained winds of 110km per hour and gustiness of up to 135kph.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rice-producing Nueva Ecija province in northern Luzon, farmlands and villages were flooded, worrying farmers such as Danilo Dagdagan due to the impact on crops and livelihood.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The floodwater from the typhoon and the surrounding provinces gushed here because the elevation of the land here is lower," Dagdagan said inside the living room of his flooded home. "It makes our lives difficult, it's hard for us especially for those without sufficient food."
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid has poured in to assist the Philippines in its relief operations, including from the US. (Reuters)

    Biden makes historic visit to Amazon rainforest

<img alt="President Biden stands with local leaders and his daughter Ashley Biden and granddaughter Natalie Biden, as he tours the Museu da Amazonia. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779606_1_20241118034611.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden became the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon rainforest on Sunday, flagging the dangers of global warming often dismissed by President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to scrap measures to fight climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden flew from Lima, Peru, to Manaus, Brazil, the largest city in the Amazon, to meet with local leaders working to preserve the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dressed casually in a blue shirt and pants, the 81-year-old chatted on the tarmac with local dignitaries before boarding a helicopter to fly over the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the helicopter tour, Biden saw severe erosion, ships grounded in one of the Amazon River’s main tributaries and fire damage. He also passed over a wildlife refuge for endangered species of monkeys and birds and the expansive waters where the Negro River tributary flows into the Amazon. He was joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and expert on how climate change is harming the Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden met indigenous leaders - introducing his daughter and granddaughter - and visited a museum at the gateway to the Amazon where indigenous women shook maracas as part of a welcoming ceremony. He then signed a US proclamation designating November 17 as International Conservation Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Amazon is home to indigenous communities and 10 per cent of Earth’s biodiversity. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil. Scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  During brief remarks from the forest, Biden sought to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. He said the US was on track to reach US$11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a six-fold increase from when he started his term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The fight to protect our planet is literally a fight for humanity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with President Xi Jinping. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Strikes by the Israeli military killed dozens in Gaza on Sunday, the civil defence said, while also hitting a Hezbollah stronghold near Beirut's international airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel has been fighting on two fronts since September, intensifying attacks on Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah after nearly a year of cross-border clashes alongside its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  A year after the Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attacks on its south, Israel vowed to stop the Islamist militants from regrouping in the north of the Palestinian territory, launching a major assault there.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest violence in the besieged Palestinian territory, the civil defence agency said Israeli air raids killed at least 46 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadliest strike, in the middle of the night in Beit Lahia in the north, killed 26 people, including women and children, and left at least 59 others buried under the rubble, said civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strike killed 10 people in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, where a separate strike on a house claimed the life of a woman, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli drone strike killed five people in the southern city of Rafah, Bassal said, adding another strike killed three women and a child in the Nuseirat camp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry on Sunday said the overall death toll in more than 13 months of war had reached 43,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the dead are civilians, according to ministry figures, which the United Nations considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Israel's second front in the north, TV footage showed several strikes hit Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, shortly after the Israeli military warned people to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Columns of smoke were seen rising over the capital's southern suburbs, where Lebanon's only international airport is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further south, overnight Israeli air strikes and shelling hit the flashpoint town of Khiam, the Lebanese state-run National News Agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the bombardment, the Israeli army said about 20 projectiles were seen crossing from Lebanon into Israel, and that some of them were intercepted. Emergency services did not immediately report any casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has escalated its bombing of Lebanon since September 23 and has since sent in ground troops, following almost a year of limited, cross-border exchanges of fire begun by Hezbollah militants in support of Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its military on Saturday said Hezbollah had already "paid a big price," but vowed to keep fighting until tens of thousands of Israelis displaced from the north can return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces also shelled the southern area of Lebanon along the Litani River, the NNA said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news agency had earlier reported strikes on the southern city of Tyre, including in a neighbourhood near Unesco-listed ancient ruins. Israel's military said late on Saturday it had hit Hezbollah sites in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Lebanon's east, the health ministry said an Israeli strike in the Bekaa Valley killed six people including three children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hezbollah said it fired a guided missile that set an Israeli tank ablaze in the southwestern Lebanese village of Chamaa.
  <br>
  <br>
  In eastern Lebanon, funerals were held for 14 civil defence staff killed in an Israeli strike on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They weren't involved with any (armed) party... they were just waiting to answer calls for help," said Ali al-Zein, a relative of one of the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese authorities say more than 3,452 people have been killed since October last year, with most casualties recorded since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced the death of a soldier in southern Lebanon, bringing to 48 the number killed fighting Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN-backed assessment on November 9 warned famine was imminent in northern Gaza, amid the increased hostilities and a near-halt in food aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has pushed back against a Human Rights Watch report this week alleging that its mass displacement of Gazans amounts to a "crime against humanity," as well as findings from a UN Special Committee pointing to warfare practices "consistent with the characteristics of genocide."
  <br>
  <br>
  A foreign ministry spokesman dismissed the HRW report as "completely false", while the United States – Israel's main military supplier – said accusations of genocide "are certainly unfounded."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, police said they arrested three suspects after flares shot near the home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the central city of Caesarea, south of Haifa, while he was away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators in Tel Aviv on Saturday reiterated demands that the government reach a deal to free dozens of hostages still held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protest came a week after mediator Qatar suspended its role until Hamas and Israel show "seriousness" in truce and hostage-release talks. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday pummelled Ukraine with a "massive" aerial barrage of missiles and drones, killing at least nine people across the country in the largest attack in months that Kyiv called "hellish."
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow launched 120 missiles and almost 100 drones, targeting Kyiv as well as southern, central and far-western corners of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civilians were killed in the Mykolaiv, Lviv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A hellish night," the spokesman for Ukraine's airforce Yuriy Ignat said on social media, saying Kyiv downed "144 targets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes caused massive power cuts across the country, with fears of a precarious winter to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Kyiv called it one of the biggest attacks in the almost three-year-long Russian assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A massive attack on our country," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past week, the aggressor used nearly 140 missiles of various types, more than 900 guided aerial bombs, and over 600 strike drones," he said, accusing Moscow of trying to "intimidate us with cold and blackouts."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came just two days after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the first time in almost two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is war criminal Putin's true response to all those who called and visited him recently," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said after the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need peace through strength, not appeasement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv had slammed Scholz for calling Putin, as have many in Germany itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Sunday, Scholz reaffirmed his country's support for Ukraine, saying that no decision on ending the war would be taken without Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine can count on us" and "no decision will be taken behind Ukraine's back," the chancellor said at Berlin airport before flying off to a G20 meeting in Rio de Janeiro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has been on the back foot militarily in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow's forces have made steady advances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The election of Donald Trump in the US has raised questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican blazingly critical of US aid to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses heard explosions in the early morning in Kyiv and lose to Sloviansk in the Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow, meanwhile, said it had hit all its targets, claiming it had targeted an "essential energy infrastructure supporting the Ukrainian military-industrial complex."
  <br>
  <br>
  But civilian deaths were reported across Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Kherson said a 51-year-old woman was killed by a drone.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the southern Mykolaiv region, local leader Vitaliy Kim said two women were killed in a night attack and that seven people – including two children – were wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll included two employees of the state railway company Ukrzaliznytsia in the city of Nikopol, who were killed when a depot was hit, the Dnipropetrovsk region's governor Sergiy Lysak and the operator said. Three more people were wounded in the bombing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people were also killed in the Odesa region, where a teenager was wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian drones also made their way to Zakarpattia – a mountainous region rarely hit – with officials saying fragments fell in the village of Pavshyno, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytsky, said a 66-year-old woman was killed in her car in the village of Sheptytsky – some 20 kilometres from the Polish border.
  <br>
  <br>
  That prompted Nato-member Poland to scramble fighter jets and mobilise all available forces on Sunday in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warsaw puts its armed forces on alert whenever attacks against its neighbouring country are deemed likely to create a danger for its own territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia, meanwhile, said a man was killed by a Ukrainian drone in its border Belgorod region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's energy operator DTEK on Sunday announced emergency power cuts in the Kyiv region and two regions in the east.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's relentless aerial bombardment has destroyed half of Ukraine's energy production capacity, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said on Telegram that Russian forces were "attacking electricity generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the harsh Ukrainian winter fast approaching, the country is already suffering from major energy shortfalls, while its outmanned and outgunned forces have been steadily ceding ground to the Kremlin's troops for weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv has implored its Western allies for help to rebuild its energy grid – a hugely expensive undertaking – and to supply its outgunned forces with more aerial defence weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But many in Ukraine fear that Western help will not be as freely given following the imminent return of Trump to the White House in January. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 31st edition of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Week has wrapped up with host nation Peru saying it has furthered three objectives, including fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders also issued a joint declaration, calling for a concerted effort in tackling issues such as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to local and international press at the end of the week-long Apec meeting, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte said she was honoured to have hosted the leaders of the bloc’s 20 other economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also praised the professional work of her colleagues for the past year, saying it has reaped immense rewards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those included the signing of a free trade agreement with Hong Kong, and updating the existing one with China, its biggest trading partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boluarte also reiterated three thematic priorities - trade and investment for inclusive and interconnected growth; innovation and digitalisation to promote transition to a formal economy; and sustainable growth for resilient development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before making her concluding remarks, the Peruvian leader and her counterparts got together one final time for the family photo, a longstanding tradition for the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session offers a chance for the host nation to showcase their traditional attire, but Peru decided to use the occasion to promote their textile products made of alpaca fibre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each leader was given a vicuna wool scarf from a local luxury brand. The price tag? US$1,415.
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours after the summit concluded, the customary Leaders’ Declaration was released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goals were similar to those in past years, including tackling climate change, reforming the World Trade Organisation, and achieving food and energy security.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A drunk man on Sunday was killed by French police outside Paris after threatening officers and shouting "Allahu akbar," an Arabic expression often shouted by Islamist attackers.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to preliminary information, the man brandished what turned out to be a dummy gun, a source close to the case said. He was "very drunk," the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At around 6.00 am (0500 GMT), police were called to an incident which saw an armed man bang on a door in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, one of the police sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man threatened the police "by pointing a handgun and shouting 'Allahu akbar'," a Muslim expression of faith meaning "God is greatest," the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police officer then drew his weapon and shot the man, who died despite the intervention of the emergency services, the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to another police source, the officer fired his weapon three times, and the man was hit once. The entire incident was captured by the police body camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, aged 30, committed an "apology for terrorism" in 2019, according to police sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case has been referred to the police's IGPN internal affairs department, which is a standard procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police officer who shot the man tested negative for drugs and alcohol. (AFP)

    Super Typhoon Man-yi batters Philippines' main island

<img alt='No fatalities have been reported, but there was "extensive" damage to trees and homes. Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779585_1_20241117191753.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Super Typhoon Man-yi slammed into the Philippines' most populous island on Sunday, with the national weather service warning of flooding, landslides and huge waves as the storm sweeps across the archipelago nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi was still packing maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour after making its first landfall late on Saturday on lightly populated Catanduanes island.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1.2 million people fled their homes ahead of Man-yi as the weather forecaster warned of a "life-threatening" impact from the powerful storm, which follows an unusual streak of violent weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi uprooted trees, brought down power lines and smashed flimsy houses to pieces after hitting Catanduanes in the typhoon-prone Bicol region.
  <br>
  <br>
  No deaths have been reported, but there was "extensive" damage to structures on Catanduanes, civil defence chief Ariel Nepomuceno said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi remained a super typhoon as it hit heavily populated Luzon – the country's economic engine – forecasters said, warning of a "potentially dangerous" situation in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significant weakening" was expected as it traversed the mountainous island, the weather service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it said severe flooding and landslides were expected as Man-yi dumped "intense to torrential" rain over provinces in its path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters also warned storm surges of up to more than three metres could swamp vulnerable coastal communities, including in Manila.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panganiban municipality in the northeast of Catanduanes took a direct hit from Man-yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photos and a drone video shared on the Facebook page of Mayor Cesar Robles showed fallen power lines, damaged and destroyed buildings, and trees and corrugated iron sheets strewn on the roads.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pepito was so strong, I have never experienced a typhoon this strong," Robles said in a post, using the local name for Man-yi, as clean-up efforts got underway and people returned home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is still a bit unsafe, there are still bursts of wind and there is much debris."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mother-of-three Marissa Cueva Alejandro, 36, who grew up in Catanduanes and sheltered with a relative during Man-yi, said typhoons were getting stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before, we would only experience (typhoon) signal number three to four, but now typhoons are getting as strong as signal number five," she said, referring to the weather service's five-tiered wind warning system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is the sixth storm in the past month to batter the archipelago nation. At least 163 people died in the previous storms, that also left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather forecaster has hoisted its highest and second-highest typhoon signals over a wide band of provinces stretching from Luzon's east coast, where Man-yi made its second landfall, across to the western side of the island where it will exit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,000 people were in emergency evacuation shelters in Dipaculao municipality in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others have stayed home to protect their property and livestock, or because they were sceptical of the warnings, said Geofry Parrocha, communications officer of Dipaculao disaster agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of our countrymen are really hard-headed. They do not believe us until the typhoon arrives," Parrocha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists emptied out of coastal resorts ahead of the typhoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our facilities are deserted," said Irene Padeo, reservation officer of the L'Sirene Boutique Resort in Baler town in Aurora, as Man-yi neared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our outdoor items have all been packed and taken indoors. We tied down all the rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  On its current trajectory, Man-yi will cross north of Manila and sweep over the South China Sea on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season – most cyclones develop between July and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency said was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951. (AFP)

    Iran 'categorically' denies envoy's meeting with Musk

<img alt="The New York Times has reported that Elon Musk met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779495_1_20241116195555.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's foreign ministry spokesman on Saturday "categorically" denied The New York Times report on Tehran's ambassador to the United Nations meeting with US tech billionaire Elon Musk, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with state news agency IRNA, spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was reported as "categorically denying such a meeting" and expressing "surprise at the coverage of the American media in this regard."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Times reported on Friday that Musk, who is a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani.
  <br>
  <br>
  It cited anonymous Iranian sources describing the encounter as "positive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian newspapers, particularly those aligned with the reformist party that supports President Masoud Pezeshkian, largely described the meeting in positive terms before Baghaei's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the weeks leading up to Trump's re-election, Iranian officials have signalled a willingness to resolve issues with the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the US-backed shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, both countries have communicated through the Swiss embassy in Tehran and the Sultanate of Oman. (AFP)

 An Indian state riven by months of ethnic tensions imposed an internet shutdown and curfew on Saturday after angry protests over the recovery of six bodies of people believed to have been kidnapped by insurgents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manipur in India's northeast has been rocked by periodic clashes for more than 18 months between the predominantly Hindu Meitei majority and the mainly Christian Kuki community, dividing the state into ethnic enclaves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies were suspected to be of those belonging to the Meitei community who went missing in Jiribam district after a gunfight between Kuki insurgents and Manipur police last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three bodies were pulled from a river in Jiribam on Friday while three more were found on Saturday, local media reports said.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the discovery provoked incensed mobs to attack the homes of seven local politicians, but only minor damage had been recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters also burned tyres and blocked roads in the capital city of Imphal on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Manipur government announced a curfew was in effect in part of the city due to the "developing law and order situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The state's home ministry also ordered all internet and mobile data services in Manipur to be shut off for two days in order to bring the latest unrest under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anti-social elements might use social media extensively for transmission of images, hate speech and hate video messages inciting the passions of the public which might have serious repercussions for the law and order situation," a notice said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Internet services were shut down for months in Manipur last year during an outbreak of violence which displaced around 60,000 people from their homes, according to government figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of the state's residents are living in emergency shelters, still unable to return home due to ongoing tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long-standing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities revolve around competition for land and public jobs.
