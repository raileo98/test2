<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian rescuers resumed a search operation on Wednesday for people missing after flash floods and landslides on Indonesia’s main island of Java that killed at least 17 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Waters from flooded rivers tore through nine villages in Pekalongan regency of Central Java province and landslides tumbled onto mountainside hamlets after the torrential rains Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said flooding triggered a landslide that buried two houses and a cafe in Petungkriyono resort area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The disasters all together destroyed 25 houses, a dam and three main bridges connecting villages in Pekalongan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muhari said at least 17 people were dead, nine were missing and 13 injured by Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 300 people were forced to flee to temporary government shelters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The search and rescue operation that was hampered by bad weather, mudslides and rugged terrain was halted on Tuesday afternoon due to heavy rain and thick fog that made devastated areas along the rivers dangerous to rescuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, they searched in rivers and the rubble of villages for bodies and, whenever possible, survivors in worst-hit Kasimpar village, said Budiono, who heads a local rescue office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scores of rescue personnel were searching through a Petungkriyono area where tons of mud and rocks buried two houses and a café to search for at least nine people reported missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos and photos released by National Search and Rescue Agency showed personnel digging desperately in villages where roads and green-terraced rice fields were transformed into murky brown mud and villages were covered by thick mud, rocks and uprooted trees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landslides and floods were also reported in many other provinces, Muhari said. On Monday, a landslide hit five houses in Denpasar on the tourist island of Bali, killing four people and leaving one missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile floodplains. (AP)

<img alt="US President Donald Trump has instructed federal agencies to dismantle their DEI programmes. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788631_1_20250122115054.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration is directing that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave, and that agencies develop plans to lay them off, according to a memo from the Office of Personnel Management.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday that asks government agency chiefs to combat Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies in federal agencies, contracting and the private sector, the White House said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order also encouraged the private sector to "end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences," the White House added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The action outlined in an Office of Personnel Management memorandum came one day after Trump issued a series of executive orders to end diversity programmes, which attempt to promote opportunities for women, ethnic minorities, LGBT people and other traditionally under-represented groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government should by the end of business on Wednesday inform employees of any government offices or units focused exclusively on DEI that their programmes will be shut down and employees placed on leave, the memorandum said.
  <br>
  <br>
  By Thursday, federal agencies are directed to compile a list of federal DEI offices and workers as of Election Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  By next Friday, they are expected to develop a plan to execute a “reduction-in-force action” against those federal workers. (Agencies)

<img alt="From left to right, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong meet at the US State Department. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788617_1_20250122095327.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States, Australia, India and Japan recommitted to working together on Tuesday, after the first meeting of the Quad grouping's top diplomats since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement after the talks in Washington, hosted by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on his first day in the job, the four nations said officials would meet regularly to prepare for an upcoming leaders' summit in India, expected this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio earlier said he said would stress the importance of working with allies "on the things that are important to America and Americans" during the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He posed with Australia's Penny Wong, India's Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Japan's Takeshi Iwaya in front of the flags of their countries before the meeting at the State Department, but did not respond to questions from reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significant that the Quad (foreign ministers' meeting) took place within hours of the inauguration of the Trump Administration," Jaishankar said on X after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This underlines the priority it has in the foreign policy of its member states."
  <br>
  <br>
  The four nations restated their "shared commitment to strengthening a Free and Open Indo-Pacific where the rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty, and territorial integrity are upheld and defended," the joint statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also met separately with the three foreign ministers on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Foreign Minister Wong told a news conference in Washington she had a "very positive discussion" with Rubio on Aukus, a trilateral security partnership that also involves the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has denounced the Quad as a Cold War construct and a political tool for the US to contain China and maintain its hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has also said the Aukus alliance would intensify a regional arms race and undermine peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific. (Reuters)

    Panama complains to UN over Trump canal threat

<img alt="Panamanian authorities have launched an audit of the Hong Kong-linked operator of two Panama Canal ports, aimed at ensuring the efficient and transparent use of public resources. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788620_1_20250122100432.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panama has complained to the United Nations over US President Donald Trump's "worrying" threat to seize the Panama Canal, even as it launched an audit of the Hong Kong-linked operator of two ports on the inter-oceanic waterway.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the government in Panama City referred to an article of the UN Charter precluding any member from "the threat or use of force" against the territorial integrity or political independence of another.
  <br>
  <br>
  The missive distributed to reporters on Tuesday urges Guterres to refer the matter to the UN Security Council, without asking for a meeting to be convened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in his inaugural address on Monday, repeated his complaint that China was effectively "operating" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panamanian comptroller's office that oversees public entities then announced an "exhaustive audit" would be launched to ensure the "efficient and transparent use of public resources" at the Panama Ports Company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company, part of Hutchison Ports, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comptroller's office said the aim was to determine whether the company was complying with its concession agreements, including adequate reporting of income, payments and contributions to the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino has denied that any other nation was interfering in the canal, which he said operated on the principle of neutrality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal is and will remain Panama's," Mulino said in response to Trump's threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Ports Company's concession agreement was extended by 25 years in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States is the canal's main user, followed by China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2000, the waterway has contributed more than US$30 billion to Panama's state coffers, including nearly US$2.5 billion in the last fiscal year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump pledged on Tuesday to hit the European Union with tariffs, adding that a 10 percent duty on Chinese imports could also come as soon as February 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump voiced his latest tariff threats in remarks to reporters at the White House a day after taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They treat us very, very badly. So they're going to be in for tariffs," Trump said of the EU. "You can't get fairness unless you do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  A day earlier, Trump accused the bloc of not importing enough American products, saying he would "straighten that out" by imposing duties or by urging for more oil and gas purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding China, Trump on Tuesday reiterated his threat to impose a 10 percent tariff, saying it was "based on the fact that they're sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked how soon these tariffs could be enacted, he added: "Probably February 1st is the date we're looking at."
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the same date he earlier said he could impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, accusing them of failing to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's economy commissioner vowed this week that the bloc was ready to defend its interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an annual meeting of global elites in Davos, Switzerland, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen declared that Europe was ready to negotiate with Trump, while maintaining that Washington remained an important partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's "first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests, and be ready to negotiate" with Trump, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles, to protect our interests and uphold our values," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, following Trump's announcement of additional tariffs, mainland media accused him of blaming China for Washington's failure to address the fentanyl crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Daily said scapegoating others cannot end the drug crisis in the US, while the Global Times urged Washington not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has spoken out against protectionism, saying no one wins in a trade war. (AFP)

    Trump 'open' to Elon Musk buying TikTok

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would be open to tech billionaire Elon Musk - the owner of social media platform X - buying Chinese-owned app TikTok.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I would be if he wanted to buy it," Trump told reporters when asked if he was open to Musk, the world's richest man and the head of a budget-cutting initiative in the new administration, acquiring the video-sharing platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok is facing down a US law that ordered the company to divest from its Chinese owner ByteDance or be banned in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one of his first acts in office, Trump ordered a pause on enforcing the law that should have seen TikTok effectively made illegal in the country on Sunday, a day before he took office for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive order directed his attorney general to delay the implementation of the law for 75 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  To save the company's US operations, Trump on Monday also floated the idea of a 50-50 partnership between "the United States" and its Chinese owner ByteDance, though he did not provide details on how this could be achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked on Tuesday if his phone had TikTok, which is banned on US government devices, Trump said: "No, but... I think I'll get it right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok briefly shut down in the United States late Saturday as the law's sale deadline approached, leaving millions of dismayed users barred from the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the tacit co-operation of Oracle, its server provider, TikTok restored service in the United States on Sunday crediting Trump's commitment to save the app for making the reversal possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even if existing users can still enjoy TikTok, Apple and Google have still not made the app available in their app stores, therefore denying downloads to new users as well as updates to those who have it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Companies that violate the law, which remains officially in effect, face penalties of up to US$5,000 per user if the app is accessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, a report that Chinese officials were considering selling the company's US operations to Musk's social media platform X was met with a firm denial from TikTok. (AFP)

    Trump highlights billion-dollar AI partnership

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Japanese tech behemoth SoftBank Group soared more than eight per cent on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump announced a major investment to build AI infrastructure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said that ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle are planning a joint venture called Stargate, which he said would build data centres and create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  These companies, along with other equity backers of Stargate, have committed US$100 billion for immediate deployment, with the remaining investment expected to occur over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison joined Trump at the White House for the launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of the project's data centres are already under construction in Texas, Ellison said at the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty will be built, half-a-million square feet each, he said. The project could power AI that analyses electronic health records and helps doctors care for their patients, Ellison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear whether the announcement was an update to a previously reported venture.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March 2024, The Information, a technology news website, reported OpenAI and Microsoft were working on plans for a US$100 billion data centre project that would include an artificial intelligence supercomputer, also called "Stargate", set to launch in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on Trump's second day in office follows the rolling back of former President Joe Biden's executive order on AI, that was intended to reduce the risks that AI poses to consumers, workers and national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oracle shares were up seven per cent on an initial report of the project earlier in the day. Nvidia, Arm Holdings and Dell shares also rose. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's army chief Herzi Halevi said on Tuesday he would resign on March 6, taking responsibility for the security lapse on October 7, 2023, when Palestinian Hamas fighters from Gaza carried out a cross-border attack on Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Halevi, who had been widely expected to step down in the wake of the deadliest single day in Israel's history, said he would complete the Israel Defence Forces' inquiries into October 7 and strengthen the IDF's readiness for security challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear who would replace Halevi, who said he would transfer the IDF command to a yet-to-be-named successor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite public anger over the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has resisted calls to open a state inquiry into its own responsibility for the security breach that resulted in 1,200 Israelis being killed and about 250 hostages taken.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address, Halevi promised a deep and transparent investigation, the details of which would be presented to the defence minister and, as much as permissible, to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of senior military officers have already resigned over October 7, and the head of the military's Southern Command, Major-General Yaron Finkelman, also said he would be resigning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe our prime minister should take example from the personal responsibility that the chief of staff has taken," activist Gil Ashkenazy, 60, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 46,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's war in Gaza, and the heavily built-up territory has been widely demolished by Israeli bombardments and airstrikes. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a fire that engulfed a hotel at a popular ski resort in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday rose to 76, officials said, expressing great "pain" at the tragedy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses said desperate guests had tried to escape using ropes, footage showed bedsheets hanging from the windows, and media reports suggest some had died after trying to jump to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pain is great," Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya told reporters at the resort in Kartalkaya, around 170 kilometres northwest of the capital Ankara.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze broke out at 3:27 am (0027 GMT) in the 12-storey Grand Kartal hotel, which has wooden cladding, Yerlikaya said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 238 guests were registered at the hotel, the minister added. It was a peak time during a two-week school holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkish authorities detained four suspects including the owner of the resort hotel, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister previously announced that six prosecutors had been allocated to investigate the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private broadcaster NTV said that the dead included three people who had jumped from the hotel's windows.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire is believed to have started in the restaurant and spread quickly, though it was not immediately clear what caused it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of the structure backs onto a cliff, making it harder for firefighters to tackle the blaze. (AFP)

    A trade war leaves no winners: Vice Premier Ding

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang warned on Tuesday that no country would emerge victorious from a trade war, in a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos as Donald Trump returned to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, told the forum that a "tug of war" was underway between supporters and opponents of economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Transformation not seen in a century is accelerating across the board with imminent tariff wars and trade wars.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global governance system is undergoing profound adjustments. Human society has once again come to a critical crossroads.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Protectionism leads nowhere, and there are no winners in a trade war," Ding said, without mentioning Trump or the US by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has also been locked in trade disputes with the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU imposed hefty tariffs on electric cars made in China last year. In turn, Beijing targeted European brandies and opened probes into EU subsidies of some dairy and pork products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without mentioning the EU or any country by name, Ding warned against "erecting green barriers that could disrupt normal economic and trade cooperation".
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for a "consistent approach" in addressing climate change and trade policies "so as to prevent economic and trade frictions from impeding the process of green transition".
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe was ready to improve ties with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed that Europe "must engage constructively with China – to find solutions in our mutual interest" despite escalating trade tensions between the two. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 10 people were killed and another 32 injured after a fire broke out at a hotel at a ski resort in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out overnight at the hotel's restaurant in the resort of Kartalkaya in Bolu province, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the victims died after jumping out of the building in a panic, Governor Abdulaziz Aydin told the state-run Anadolu Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private NTV television said some people tried to climb down from their rooms using sheets.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 234 guests staying at the hotel, Aydin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Necmi Kepcetutan, a ski instructor at the hotel, said he was asleep when the fire erupted and he rushed out of the building. He told NTV television that he then helped some 20 guests out of the hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the hotel was engulfed in smoke, making it difficult for guests to locate the fire escape.
  <br>
  <br>
  Television images showed the roof and top floors of the hotel on fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the fire was not immediately known. NTV television suggested that the wooden cladding on the hotel's exterior may have accelerated the spread of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kartalkaya is a popular ski resort in the Koroglu mountains, some 300 kilometres east of Istanbul. The fire occurred during the school semester break when hotels in the region are packed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aydin's office said 30 fire trucks and 28 ambulances were sent to the site. (AP)

<img alt='Donald Trump has directed federal agencies to "investigate and remedy" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788495_2_20250121153340.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese stocks and the yuan tentatively rose on Tuesday, with investors relieved that US President Donald Trump did not announce hefty trade tariffs at his inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump returned to the White House on Monday with an ambitious agenda spanning trade reform, immigration, tax cuts and deregulation. He did not target China in his inauguration speech nor did he immediately impose tariffs as previously promised, sparking a relief rally in global stocks and a drop in the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, Trump directed federal agencies to "investigate and remedy" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries, and said he might impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re thinking in terms of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada,” Trump said late on Monday night in the Oval Office. “I think February 1.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian leaders earlier expressed relief the tariffs were not imposed on the first day of Trump taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75 percent of Canada’s exports, which include automobiles and parts, go to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also signed an order on Monday directing agencies to study a host of trade issues including deficits, unfair practices and currency manipulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  These could pave the way for further duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also directed federal agencies to assess China's performance under the Phase 1 trade deal that he signed with Beijing in 2020 during his first term at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal had required China to increase purchases of US exports by US$200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets when the Covid-19 pandemic struck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's start to his presidency "is better than I expected," said Charles Wang, chairman of Shenzhen Dragon Pacific Capital Management Co.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuan Yuwei, founder and chief investment officer of Water Wisdom Asset Management, called Trump's return "marginally positive" and expected the new president to be less stringent in his crackdown on China than predecessor Joe Biden, who "sought to strangle China to death".
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 index has dropped roughly five percent since Trump won the election on November 5 with a threat to impose steep tariffs of 60 percent on Chinese goods, but had already rebounded over the past week amid gestures of goodwill between Beijing and Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump, in his inaugural address, repeated his complaint that China was effectively "operating" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the vital waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back," Trump said after taking the oath inside the US Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama reacted sharply to Trump's pledge, saying the key inter-oceanic waterway would remain under its control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal is and will remain Panama's," President Jose Raul Mulino said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump in his first day back in office on Monday signed an executive order directing the United States to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), and from the Paris climate accord for a second time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the White House hours after his inauguration, Trump said the United States was paying far more to the WHO compared to China, adding: "World Health ripped us off."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, the largest donor to the Geneva-based organisation, provides substantial financial support that is vital to the WHO's operations. Its withdrawal is expected to trigger a significant restructuring of the institution and could further disrupt global health initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following Trump's announcement to exit the agency, the Foreign Ministry said the role of the WHO should only be strengthened, not weakened.
  <br>
  <br>
  China will continue to support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the second time Trump has sought to sever ties with the WHO.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his new executive order, Trump directed agencies to "pause the future transfer of any United States government funds, support, or resources to the WHO" and to "identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also once again withdrew the United States from the Paris climate deal, removing the world's biggest historic emitter from global efforts to fight climate change for the second time in a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move places the United States alongside Iran, Libya and Yemen as the only countries in the world outside the 2015 pact, in which governments agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China is concerned about the US announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting climate change is a common challenge faced by humanity, Guo said no country can stay aloof or unaffected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's determination and actions to actively address climate change remain consistent," he said, adding that the Chinese side will work with all parties to actively tackle the challenges of climate change. (Agencies)

<img alt="Josef Gregory Mahoney says Donald Trump's inauguration speech had " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788447_1_20250121101535.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international relations professor on Tuesday said Donald Trump’s inauguration speech had "sort of imperialistic overtures".
 <br>
  <br>
  Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai made the remarks on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme as the newly-sworn in US president vowed to “take back” the Panama Canal and potentially rename the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America, and invoked a “manifest destiny” in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One wonders if there's sort of this parallel that Trump is creating with this old 18th century idea of the US controlling the Western Hemisphere, at least the northern part of the Western Hemisphere, in as much as he's made overtures towards Greenland, Canada in terms of imperialistic overtures, but also things related to Mexico and now the Panama Canal and then renaming potentially the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One wonders if he’s creating sort of parallel with China where you have China in the South China Sea, China in the American mind trying to impose its sort of manifest destiny in East Asia.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahoney also pointed out that Trump made a wise move by holding back on tariffs against China, as the implementation would have roiled the markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we all realised that tariffs are lose-lose at this point, that's what almost every study has confirmed,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And that the biggest losers of all are American consumers who end up paying essentially inflationary prices for products as much as they have to bear the costs of the tariffs. And the United States depends much more on products from China than vice versa.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Before taking office, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticised Beijing for violating Hong Kong’s autonomy, saying it was now  a “semi-autonomous entity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahoney believes the statement will spark concerns towards how Washington will treat the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This, you know, raises the spectre about whether or not the United States will start to treat Hong Kong as being part of the mainland and how that could have implications for the special status that Hong Kong has vis-a-vis the United States in terms of financial regulations,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That remains something of serious concern that we'll have to continue to watch. On the one hand, Rubio has said that he's committed to Hong Kong autonomy, but if he's decided that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous, then that raises a whole different perspective.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump on Monday pardoned nearly everyone criminally charged with participating in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, in a show of solidarity with supporters who stormed the seat of American power in his name.
 <br>
  <br>
  The far-reaching action also cuts short the sentences of 14 members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers organisations, including some who were convicted of seditious conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document also directs the US attorney general to drop all pending cases related to the riot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What they've done to these people is outrageous," Trump, a Republican, told reporters in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are the hostages - approximately 1,500 people - for a pardon, full pardon," he said at a signing ceremony shortly after arriving at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they come out tonight frankly," he said. "They're expecting it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, whose first term as president ended under the cloud of the Capitol assault, has repeatedly played down the unprecedented violence of January 6, even going so far as to describe it as a "day of love."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 140 police officers were injured in hours of clashes with rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault on the Capitol followed a fiery speech by then-president Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House in which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 race. He then encouraged the crowd to march on Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was charged by special counsel Jack Smith with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the case never made it to trial, and was dropped under the Justice Department's policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the latest figures from the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, 1,583 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol siege, including 608 accused of assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for the former leader of the Proud Boys group, Enrique Tarrio, said he expected his client to be released from federal prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tarrio is serving a 22-year sentence, the longest of anyone criminally charged in the riot, for seditious conspiracy. He was found guilty of plotting to violently oppose the transfer of power after the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for Tarrio's co-defendant, Joe Biggs, said he was also told by an intermediary that Biggs is being processed for release. Biggs, who held a senior post in the Proud Boys, was also convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 17 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Constitution gives presidents broad pardon power and there is no legal mechanism for challenging a presidential pardon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden, before leaving office on Monday, issued pre-emptive pardons to former Covid pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci, retired general Mark Milley and close family members to shield them from "politically-motivated prosecutions" by the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden gave similar pardons to former Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney and other members of the congressional committee that investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just minutes before Trump was sworn in, Biden announced he was issuing pardons to his brother James Biden, James's wife Sara Jones Biden, his sister Valerie Biden Owens, Valerie's husband John Owens, and his brother Francis Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me -- the worst kind of partisan politics," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end." (Agencies)

    Gusts, extreme fire weather return to LA

<div class="itemFullText">
 Windy and dry conditions returned to Southern California on Monday, raising the risk of new wildfires sparking as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area that started in similar weather nearly two weeks ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gusts could peak at 113 kph along the coast and 160 kph in the mountains and foothills during extreme fire weather that is expected to last through Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service issued a warning of a “particularly dangerous situation” for parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties from Monday afternoon until Tuesday morning due to low humidity and damaging Santa Ana winds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities urged people not to mow their lawns to prevent sparking a fire, nor start any fires that could get out of control.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also asked residents to review their evacuation plans and ready emergency kits and be on the lookout for any new blazes and report them quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Acuna, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said the biggest concerns are the Palisades and Eaton Fires breaking their containment lines and a new blaze starting.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Don’t do things to start another fire so we can focus on the mitigation of the current fires,” Acuna said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The low humidity, bone-dry vegetation and strong Santa Ana winds come as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area, the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out during fierce winds on January 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palisades fire was 59 per cent contained on Monday and the Eaton fire 87 per cent contained, according to fire officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump, who was sworn in as US president on Monday, has said he will be visiting the fire-ravaged areas at the end of the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  That trip could include an awkward encounter with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been the target of Trump's barbs over his handling of the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has falsely claimed that Newsom had blocked the diversion of "excess rain and snow melt from the North."
  <br>
  <br>
  In reality, Los Angeles' water supplies are mainly fed via aqueducts and canals originating from entirely separate river basins further east. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 900 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza on Monday, the United Nations said, exceeding the daily target outlined in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Humanitarian aid continues to move into the Gaza Strip as part of a prepared surge to increase support to survivors," the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, 915 trucks crossed into Gaza, according to information received through engagement with Israeli authorities and the guarantors for the ceasefire agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Throughout the conflict in Gaza, the UN has denounced obstacles restricting the flow and distribution of aid into the battered Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, the day the ceasefire came into force, 630 trucks entered Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  An initial 42-day truce between Israel and Hamas is meant to enable a surge of sorely needed aid for Gaza after 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire agreement calls for 600 trucks to cross into Gaza per day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hamas said on Monday it would next release hostages held in Gaza on Saturday, after an official with the Palestinian militant group had said they would be released a day later than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas is set to release more than 90 hostages over the coming weeks as part of the ceasefire deal. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump vowed a new "golden age" as he took the oath for a historic second US presidential term on Monday, painting a picture of an America in decline that only his hardline policies can restore to glory.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an address in the US Capitol, the 47th president promised a blitz of orders including the declaration of a national emergency on the Mexican border and a policy of only recognizing two genders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also struck a nationalistic tone as he capped the most extraordinary comeback in US political history, pledging to impose trade tariffs, rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, and take "back" the Panama Canal, which has been controlled by the Central American country since 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The golden age of America begins right now. From this day forward our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world," Trump said in the Capitol, where the inauguration was held indoors for the first time in decades, due to freezing weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican even appeared to suggest he was on a divine mission, saying "I was saved by God to make America great again" after escaping an assassin's bullet at an election rally in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  While promising renewal, Trump denounced what he said had been a "betrayal" of Americans by a "radical and corrupt establishment" under outgoing President Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "America's decline is over," said Trump, who at 78 is now the oldest president ever to take office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden, 82, who had earlier hosted Trump and his wife Melania at the White House for tea, watched on as his political rival read the last rites over his single term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden's last acts in office included preemptive pardons of former officials and his own siblings to shield them from Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Trump and said on Monday he was open to talks on the Ukraine conflict. (AFP)

    Donald Trump sworn in as 47th US president

 Donald Trump was sworn in for a historic second term as US president on Monday, pledging a blitz of immediate orders on immigration and the US culture wars as he caps his extraordinary comeback.
 <br>
  <br>
  With one hand raised in the air, the 47th US president solemnly took the oath of office beneath the huge Rotunda of the US Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump and outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden had earlier travelled by motorcade together to the Capitol, where the ceremony was being held indoors - and with a much smaller crowd - for the first time in decades due to frigid weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, they and their spouses met for a traditional tea at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Welcome home," Biden said to Trump as he and First Lady Jill Biden greeted their successors at the front door to the presidential residence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, was a political outsider at his first inauguration in 2017 as the 45th president, but this time around he is surrounded by America's wealthy and powerful.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man, Elon Musk, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and Google CEO Sundar Pichai all had prime seats in the Capitol alongside Trump's family and cabinet members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, who bankrolled Trump's election campaign to the tune of a quarter of a billion dollars and promotes far-right policies on the X social network, will lead a cost-cutting drive in the new administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump refused to attend Biden's 2021 inauguration after falsely claiming electoral fraud by the Democrat, this time Biden has been keen to restore the sense of tradition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden joined former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton at the Capitol. Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush were there but ex-first lady Michelle Obama pointedly stayed away. (AFP)

    Rapist and murderer of Indian doctor jailed for life

<img alt="Police stand guard at an entrance of Civil and Criminal Court during the verdict for the case of the rape and murder of an Indian doctor in Kolkata. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788348_1_20250120180810.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The rapist and murderer of an Indian doctor was sentenced to life in prison on Monday, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and widespread hospital strikes last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her weeping family had called for the convicted killer to be hanged and said they were "shocked" at the sentence, for a case that highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Judge Anirban Das said the case did not deserve the death penalty as it was not "the rarest of the rare cases", and ordered that Sanjoy Roy must spend his life behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata in August 2024 sparked outrage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy, 33, the lone accused in the case, was arrested a day after the victim's body was discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  The murder led to demands by doctors at government hospitals for additional security, with thousands of citizens in Kolkata and elsewhere in India joining doctors' protests in solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court last year ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the brutality of the killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of Roy, who pleaded not guilty and repeatedly insisted on his innocence was fast-tracked through India's normally glacial legal system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victim's mother, who was seated close to Roy when he was convicted on Saturday, has said the family wanted him to be hanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are shocked by the verdict", the victim's father told AFP, tears running down his face.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue our fight, and won't let investigations stop... Come what may, we will fight for justice." (AFP)

    SKorea central bank cuts forecasts due to Yoon crisis

<img alt="South Korea's central bank cuts its 2025 growth forecast due to the country's ongoing political crisis. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788281_1_20250120120734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's central bank on Monday said it had slashed its 2025 growth forecast because of the political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule on December 3, sending soldiers to parliament but lawmakers voted the measure down and later impeached the president, who is now being held for a criminal probe on insurrection charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He initially resisted arrest and has refused to cooperate with investigators and, when his detention was extended, his die-hard supporters attacked a court building on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unexpected declaration of martial law in early December, coupled with the ongoing political turmoil and the Jeju Air passenger plane disaster, significantly dampened economic sentiment," the Bank of Korea said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 crashed on December 29 in southwestern Muan airport, killing 179 people in the worst ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The political turmoil and crash "led to contractions in domestic consumption and construction investment, likely causing the fourth-quarter growth rate to fall well below the November projection", the bank said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumption, which had shown improvement in the third quarter, appeared to weaken again in the fourth quarter," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, the bank's Monetary Policy Committee revised down its estimate for the last quarter of 2024, from 2.2 percent to a range of 2.0-2.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had projected 1.9 percent growth for 2025, but "the forecast has been revised downward to 1.6-1.7 percent", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This adjustment is primarily attributed to the impact of political uncertainty triggered by the declaration of martial law last December, which has dampened economic sentiment," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is estimated to reduce this year's growth rate by approximately 0.2 percentage points, particularly affecting domestic consumption and other areas of domestic demand," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is the first sitting South Korean president ever to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Yoon behind bars, prosecutors are due to formalise a criminal indictment for insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could be jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon refused to attend questioning on Monday, his lawyers said, with the Corruption Investigation Office -- the body in charge of the probe -- saying it was looking at whether to compel him to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has also been absent from the parallel probe at the Constitutional Court, which is considering whether to uphold his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If that court rules against him, Yoon will formally lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Han Zheng on Sunday told American Vice President-elect JD Vance that there is a lot of room for China-US cooperation, in a meeting ahead of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han told Vance that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to "implement the important consensus reached between President Xi Jinping and US president-elect Donald Trump", Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, who is in the US for the inauguration ceremony, also told Vance that the nation is ready to promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, Han also said both sides could make contributions to world peace and development, as long as they adhere to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Economic and trade relations are important issues of common concern to both sides. While there are differences and friction between China and the US, there are many common interests, and the space for cooperation between the two nations is huge. The two sides should strengthen dialogue and negotiations on this front," Han was quoted by Xinhua as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting came a day before Trump and Vance will be sworn in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also reported that Han met Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who became a key Trump ally during his campaign, and other representatives of the business community in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his meeting with Musk, Han said Beijing welcomes US companies, including Tesla, "to seize the opportunity and share the fruits of China's development" while making greater contributions in promoting China-US economic and trade relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, according to Xinhua, told Han that his company is ready to increase its investments in and cooperation with China and play a role in promoting bilateral economic and trade exchanges.

    Trump vows to end 'American decline'

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a rally the day before his inauguration as Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk gestures. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788274_1_20250120110649.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump pledged a blitz of presidential actions to end "American decline," telling a fired-up inauguration eve rally on Sunday he would crack down on woke ideology and immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a raucous campaign-style gathering in Washington, the 78-year-old Republican promised cheering supporters that he would act with "historic speed" from day one of his White House comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand new day of American strength and prosperity," Trump told a packed sports arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will act with historic speed and strength and fix every single crisis facing our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was joined on stage by Elon Musk -- the tech tycoon who will lead a major cost-cutting drive in his administration -- and who vowed to make America strong "for centuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Then at the end the rally Trump danced alongside the disco band Village People as they performed their 1970s hit "YMCA" which became the unofficial anthem of his election campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Trump's hour-long speech focused on immigration, driving home one of the dark messages that helped spur his remarkable victory in November's presidential election over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to stop the invasion of our borders," added Trump, who has pledged to launch raids targeting undocumented migrants within days of taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Trump effect" has already been on display, with TikTok crediting his "clarity" for being able to restore service in the United States after briefly going dark due to a ban on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to save TikTok," Trump told the rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also promised "lots" of executive orders from his first day back in the Oval Office, including one to ban "transgender insanity" and critical race theory from schools and to keep trans athletes out of women's sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also reiterated a promise to release files on the assassinations of former president John F Kennedy, his brother Bobby Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long lines of Trump supporters formed outside the arena despite snowy conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the future US commander-in-chief paid a highly symbolic visit to Arlington National Cemetery, the resting place of America's war dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, followed by Vice President-elect JD Vance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sombre ceremony contrasted with Trump's last trip to the cemetery as a presidential candidate in August, when the US army criticised his staff for pushing a cemetery employee.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump's hopes for a huge crowd to see his inauguration at the US Capitol on Monday took a blow, however, when forecasts of below freezing weather prompted organisers to move the ceremony indoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of being sworn in on the steps of the Capitol, Trump will now take the oath under the massive dome of its Rotunda, last used for the ceremony 40 years ago during the inauguration of Ronald Reagan. (AFP)

    Freed Israeli hostages reunited with mothers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinians burst into streets to celebrate and began returning to the rubble of bombed-out homes on Sunday after a ceasefire deal halted fighting in Gaza, while three female hostages freed by Hamas were reunited with their mothers inside Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters drove through the southern city of Khan Younis with crowds cheering and chanting. In the north of the territory, bombed into oblivion in the war's most intense fighting, people picked their way on narrow roads through a devastated landscape of rubble and twisted metal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like at last I found some water to drink after being lost in the desert for 15 months," said Aya, a displaced woman from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for over a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tel Aviv, hundreds of Israelis in a square outside the defence headquarters watched a live broadcast from Gaza showing the hostage release on a giant screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd cheered, embraced and wept as three female hostages could be seen getting into a Red Cross vehicle surrounded by armed Hamas fighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after, the Israeli military said Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari had been reunited with their mothers at a meeting point inside Israel, close to the kibbutz and nearby music festival where they had been abducted in the October 7, 2023 Hamas raid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three appeared in good health in a video later released by the military. Damari, who lost two fingers when she was shot the day she was abducted, could be seen smiling and embracing her mother as she held up a bandaged hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like you to tell them: Romi, Doron and Emily – an entire nation embraces you. Welcome home," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a commander by phone as the hostages were driven across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, buses awaited the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli detention. Hamas said the first group to be freed in exchange for the hostages includes 69 women and 21 teenage boys.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the truce in the 15-month-old war between Israel and Hamas took effect following a three-hour delay during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  That last-minute Israeli blitz killed 13 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israel blamed Hamas for being late to deliver the names of hostages it would free, and said it had struck terrorists. Hamas said the holdup in providing the list was technical.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today the guns in Gaza have gone silent," US President Joe Biden said on his last full day in office, welcoming a truce that had eluded US diplomacy for more than a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a long road," Biden said. "But we've reached this point today because of the pressure Israel built on Hamas, backed by the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce calls for fighting to stop, aid to be sent in to Gaza and 33 of nearly 100 Israeli and foreign hostages to go free over the six-week first phase in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. (Reuters)

    TikTok restores service in US, thanking Trump

<img alt='TikTok said on Sunday that it is "in the process of restoring service" in the United States. Image: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788237_1_20250120034419.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok said on Sunday it was restoring its service after US President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the United States when he returns to power on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As a result of president Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the US," the platform said in a message to users.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok also issued an earlier statement after US users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website, while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive."
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok stopped working for US users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like the United States to have a 50 percent ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. (Reuters)

    Palestinians return to their homes as ceasefire begins

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of Palestinians burst into the streets across Gaza as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on Sunday, some in celebration, others to visit the graves of relatives, while many rushed back to see what remained of their homes.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like at last I found some water to drink after getting lost in the desert for 15 months. I feel alive again," Aya, a displaced woman from Gaza City, who has been sheltering in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for over a year, told Reuters via a chat app.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the north of the territory, where some of the most intense Israeli airstrikes and battles with the militants took place, hundreds of people picked their way through a devastated landscape of rubble and twisted metal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armed Hamas fighters drove through the southern city of Khan Younis, with crowds cheering and chanting, despite an almost three-hour delay in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, which follows 15 months of devastating conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas policemen, dressed in blue police uniform, deployed in some areas after months of trying to keep out of sight to avoid Israeli airstrikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who had gathered to cheer the fighters chanted "Greetings to Al-Qassam Brigades" - the armed wing of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the resistance factions are staying in spite of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu," one fighter told Reuters, referring to the armed wing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a ceasefire, a full and comprehensive one God willing, and there will be no return to war in spite of him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire deal took effect after a nearly three-hour delay, pausing a war that has brought seismic political change to the Middle East and giving hope to Gaza's 2.3 million people, many of whom have been displaced several times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said Israeli military strikes killed at least 13 people in attacks across the enclave during the delay. No more attacks were reported after it took effect at 11.15 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now waiting for the day when we head back to our home in Gaza City," Aya said. "Damaged or not, it doesn't matter, the nightmare of death and starvation is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  The streets in the shattered Gaza City in the north of the territory were already busy with groups of people waving the Palestinian flag and filming the scenes on their mobile phones. Several carts loaded with household possessions travelled down a thoroughfare scattered with rubble and debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Ayham, 40, sheltering with his family in Khan Younis, said the scene of destruction in his home city was "dreadful", adding that while the ceasefire may have spared lives it was no time for celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are in pain, deep pain and it is time that we hug one another and cry," Abu Ayham said via the same app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The highly anticipated ceasefire deal could help usher in an end to the Gaza war, which began after Hamas, which controls the tiny coastal territory, attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's response has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed nearly 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza-based health officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long lines of trucks carrying fuel and aid supplies queued up at border crossings in the hours before the ceasefire was due to take effect. The World Food Programme said they began to cross on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal requires 600 truckloads of aid to be allowed into Gaza every day of the initial six-week ceasefire, including 50 carrying fuel. Half of the 600 aid trucks would be delivered to Gaza's north, where experts have warned famine is imminent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The war ended, but life isn't going to be better because of the destruction and the losses we suffered," Aya said. "But at least there will be no more bloodshed of women and children, I hope." (Reuters)

    Israel says truce with Hamas begins, after delay

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Sunday said a truce with Hamas began in Gaza at 5.15pm Hong Kong time, nearly three hours after initially scheduled, following a last-minute delay on the orders of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu had said the ceasefire could not take effect until Hamas gave the names of the hostages up for release on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least eight Palestinians died from Israeli attacks that occurred between the period when the ceasefire was meant to begin until it actually took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, which ultimately published the names of three Israeli women to be released, attributed the delay in producing the names to "technical reasons", as well as the "complexities of the field situation and the continued bombing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel then confirmed it had received the list, adding that four other living female hostages would be freed in seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, thousands of displaced Gazans carrying tents, clothes and personal belongings began heading to their homes after the ceasefire took effect following more than 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinians were seen travelling by truck, donkey cart and on foot back to their homes through devastated swathes of Gaza, particularly in the northern parts of the Palestinian territory. (Reuters/AFP)

 A long-awaited ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war was delayed on Sunday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the last minute that it would not take effect until the Palestinian militant group provided a list of the hostages to be released.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, while "affirming its commitment" to the terms of the ceasefire, said: "The delay in providing the names of those to be released in the first batch is due to technical reasons."
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from Netanyahu's office, issued less than an hour before the truce was to start, said he had "instructed the IDF (military) that the ceasefire... will not begin until Israel has received the list".
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial exchange was to see three Israeli hostages released from captivity in return for a first group of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the ceasefire goes ahead, a total of 33 hostages taken by militants during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel will be returned from Gaza during an initial 42-day truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the deal, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is intended to pave the way for an end to more than 15 months of war sparked by the October 7 attack, the deadliest in Israeli history.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a deal struck by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of negotiations, and takes effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had US support to return to war if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling the 42-day first phase a "temporary ceasefire", he said: "If we are forced to resume the war, we will do so with force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting continued right up to the eve of the truce, with Gaza's civil defence agency saying that at least five members of one family were killed when an Israeli strike hit their tent in the southern city of Khan Yunis. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 11.45am Hong Kong time on Sunday: "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to US national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court extended the detention of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Sunday over concerns he could destroy evidence linked to his martial law declaration, enraging his supporters who attacked the court building.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of pro-Yoon protesters smashed windows and broke down doors to enter the court after the decision was announced, chanting the name of the president, who plunged South Korea into its worst political chaos in decades with his bid to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's December 3 martial law declaration lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them. He was impeached soon after and suspended from duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was detained in a dawn raid on Wednesday on insurrection charges after he refused investigators' summons and went to ground in his residence, using his presidential security detail to resist arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon had also refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The disgraced leader, who attended court for the first time on Saturday over his case, will now remain in custody, with the new warrant allowing investigators to keep him for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer Seok Dong-hyeon slammed the court decision, but also warned the president's supporters not to escalate the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is likely not what President Yoon desires," he said in a statement, adding violence could also "create burdens" for the president's future trials. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A ceasefire in the Gaza war begins on Sunday morning, mediator Qatar said, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to bring back "all the hostages" held in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The truce is intended to end more than 15 months of fighting and devastating bombardment, but in a televised address on Saturday evening, the hawkish premier stressed Israel had US support to return to war if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an initial 42-day ceasefire, Palestinian militant groups will hand over 33 hostages, three of them on Sunday, and Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, some of whom will be deported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since mediators Qatar and the United States, which brokered the deal along with Egypt, announced the details on Wednesday, Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Gaza's civil defence rescue agency said at least five members of one family were killed when a strike hit their tent in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions were heard over Jerusalem as Yemen's Huthi rebels launched a barrage of missiles at Israel in a show of support for the Palestinians ahead of the truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Huthis said they targeted the defence ministry in Tel Aviv and also fired two missiles at the Red Sea port city of Eilat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani told Sky News the framework signed this week was the same as one agreed in December 2023, adding it amounted to 13 months of "waste".
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is to take effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration for a second term as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told US network NBC on Saturday that he had told Netanyahu that the war "has to end". "We want it to end, but to keep doing what has to be done," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh on Saturday detained a second person suspected of involvement in a knife attack in which Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was wounded.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan, 54, was stabbed six times by an intruder during a burglary attempt at his home in Mumbai early on Thursday. He had surgery after sustaining stab wounds to his spine, neck and hands, and is out of danger, doctors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got information from Mumbai Police that a suspect is travelling by Jnaneswari Express train," Sanjeev Sinha, a representative of the Railway Protection Force, told the ANI news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "...Mumbai Police officials were contacted through video call and the suspect's identity was confirmed. He has been detained," Sinha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in India's financial capital of Mumbai had on Friday detained another key suspect in the knife attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack on Khan, one of Bollywood's most bankable and well-known actors, shocked the film industry and Mumbai residents, with many calling for better policing and security. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two judges were killed in a shooting attack on Saturday at the Supreme Court building in Tehran, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Three judges of the Supreme Court were targeted. Two of them were martyred," the Judiciary's Mizan Online website reported, adding that the "assailant killed himself."
  <br>
  <br>
  State news agency IRNA also reported that one other person was injured in the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizan identified the two slain judges as Ali Razini and Mohammad Moghisseh, adding that they worked on cases "fighting crimes against national security, espionage and terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  The motive behind their killing was not immediately clear, but Mizan said the assailant was not involved in any cases before the Supreme Court, without providing further details on the attacker's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said an investigation into the incident was launched, Mizan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran judge Moghisseh, 68, was sanctioned in 2019 by the United States for having "overseen countless unfair trails, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded," according to the US Department of the Treasury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Razini, 71, held several important positions in Iran's judiciary and was previously targeted in a 1998 assassination attempt by assailants "who planted a magnetic bomb on his vehicle," according to Mizan.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August 2005, renowned Iranian judge Hassan Moghaddas was murdered by two gunmen who climbed into his car in the middle of a busy business district in Tehran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two men convicted over his killing were publicly executed by hanging two years later. (AFP)

    Indian court finds man guilty in hospital rape case

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian court on Saturday found a 33-year-old man guilty of the rape and murder of a doctor, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and hospital strikes last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the victim's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata last August once again highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  It led to demands by doctors at government hospitals for additional security, with thousands of citizens in Kolkata and elsewhere in India joining the doctors' protests in solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of defendant Sanjoy Roy was fast-tracked through India's normally glacial legal system and arguments in the case concluded a little over a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sentence will be delivered on Monday," presiding judge Anirban Das said after finding Roy, a civic volunteer in the hospital, guilty of rape and murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy has consistently maintained his innocence and again told the court that he was not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have been framed," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy was brought to court by a prison van and greeted by a crowd of protesters, held at bay by police officers, demanding he be given the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hang him, hang him," they chanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentiment was echoed by the victim's family, none of whom have been identified in keeping with Indian law around the reporting of sexual violence cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The common man will lose faith in the judiciary if he is not handed down the death penalty," said the victim's mother, seated just a few metres from Roy when the verdict was read out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her father added: "He brutally snuffed out the life of our daughter. He deserves the same fate."
  <br>
  <br>
  The trainee doctor was found raped and murdered in a seminar room of the hospital last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crime led to nationwide outrage and prolonged protests by doctors across the state, demanding justice for the victim and stronger security measures in government hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy was arrested a day after the victim's body was discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court set up a national task force after the protests that suggested ways to enhance safety measures in government hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gruesome nature of the attack drew comparisons with the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, which also sparked weeks of nationwide protests. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was in court for the first time on Saturday for a crucial hearing that will decide whether to extend his detention as investigators probe his failed martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's supporters rallied outside the court and scuffled with police as he arrived in a blue van, weeks after throwing the nation into chaos by attempting to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's December 3 martial law bid lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was subsequently impeached by parliament and resisted arrest for weeks, holed up in his guarded residence until he was finally detained on Wednesday in a dawn raid.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the disgraced president remains in custody after investigators requested a new warrant on Friday to extend his detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  He decided to appear in court "with the intention of restoring his honour," the president's lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said before the hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Seoul Western District Court later confirmed that the hearing commenced with the president in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  After reviewing the request to extend Yoon's detention, a judge is expected to announce her decision on Saturday night or early on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the court, crowds of Yoon's backers waving flags and holding "release the president" placards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police officers formed a chain to prevent them reaching the court entrance, which has been closed to the public since Friday evening over safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  If approved, as expected, the new warrant would likely extend Yoon's detention by 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would give prosecutors time to formalise an indictment for insurrection, a charge that could see him jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  If indicted, the president would probably be detained for the duration of the trial. (AFP)

<img alt="For these starving Palestinians the truce cannot come fast enough. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788118_1_20250118141650.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's cabinet voted to approve a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal on Saturday, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ending days of uncertainty about whether the truce would go into effect this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip will take effect at 0630 GMT on Sunday morning, Qatar, which helped mediate the deal, said on Saturday, and would halt the fighting and bombardment in Gaza's deadliest-ever war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would also enable the release of hostages held in the territory since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has approved the hostage return plan," Netanyahu's office said early on Saturday morning after the cabinet held its vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's justice ministry has said 737 prisoners and detainees will be freed as part of the first phase of the deal – none before 4:00 pm local time (1400 GMT) on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli strikes have killed dozens since the ceasefire deal was announced, with the military saying on Thursday it had hit about 50 targets across Gaza over the previous 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is to take effect on the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump, who claimed credit for working with outgoing US President Joe Biden's team to seal the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was earlier approved by Israel's security cabinet, with Netanyahu's office saying it "supports achieving the objectives of the war."
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinian Authority has completed preparations "to assume full responsibility in Gaza" after the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even before the truce begins, displaced Gazans were preparing to return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will go to kiss my land," said Nasr al-Gharabli, who fled his home in Gaza City for a camp further south. "If I die on my land, it would be better than being here as a displaced person."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, there was joy but also anguish over the remaining hostages taken in the Hamas attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kfir Bibas, whose second birthday falls on Saturday, is the youngest hostage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas said in November 2023 that Kfir, his four-year-old brother Ariel and their mother Shiri had died in an air strike, but with the Israeli military yet to confirm their deaths, many are clinging to hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think of them, these two little redheads, and I get shivers," said 70-year-old Osnat Nyska, whose grandchildren attended nursery with the Bibas brothers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two far-right ministers had voiced opposition to the deal, with one threatening to quit the cabinet, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said before the vote he believed the ceasefire would proceed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident, and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said Israel pounded several areas of the territory, killing more than 100 people and wounding hundreds more since the deal was announced on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, warned that Israeli strikes were risking the lives of hostages and could turn their "freedom... into a tragedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 7, 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 people taken hostage, 94 are still in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,876 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the UN considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire agreement followed intensified efforts by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of fruitless negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the days of talks, Biden pointman Brett McGurk was joined in the region by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff in an unusual pairing to get the deal over the line, US officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we weren't involved... the deal would've never happened," Trump said in an interview on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, announcing the agreement on Wednesday, said an initial 42-day ceasefire would see 33 hostages released.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, he said: "We seek a full implementation of the first phase, and for the second phase to be the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are waiting for the Security Council to issue a binding resolution to implement the agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli authorities assume the 33 are alive, but Hamas has yet to confirm that.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also in the first phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza's densely populated areas and allow displaced Palestinians to return "to their residences," the Qatari prime minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two sources close to Hamas said three Israeli women soldiers would be the first to be released on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women may, in fact, be civilians, as the militant group refers to all Israelis of military age who have undergone mandatory military service as soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli military official said reception points had been established at Kerem Shalom, Erez and Reim, where hostages would be joined by doctors and mental health specialists before being "transported via helicopter or vehicle" to hospitals in Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel "is then expected to release the first group of Palestinian prisoners, including several with high sentences," a source said on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During talks on Friday, negotiators agreed to form a joint operations room in Cairo to "ensure effective coordination" and compliance with the truce terms, Egyptian state-linked media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron said French-Israeli citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi were among the hostages due to be freed in the first phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden said the second phase could bring a "permanent end to the war."
  <br>
  <br>
  In aid-starved Gaza, where nearly all of its 2.4 million people have been displaced at least once, humanitarian workers worry about the monumental task ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything has been destroyed, children are on the streets, you can't pinpoint just one priority," said Doctors Without Borders coordinator Amande Bazerolle. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump said his inauguration will be held inside the US Capitol rather than outdoors because of severe cold.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The weather forecast for Washington, DC, with the wind chill factor, could take temperatures into severe record lows. There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don't want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way," Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, I have ordered the Inauguration Address, in addition to prayers and other speeches, to be delivered in the United States Capitol Rotunda," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump referred to the last time an inauguration was moved indoors because of the cold - former Republican President Ronald Reagan's second swearing-in in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said supporters can view the ceremony on screens inside the Capital One Arena, a sports venue in downtown Washington that holds 20,000 people. (Reuters)

    US Supreme Court upholds TikTok ban

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court refused to rescue TikTok on Friday from a law that requires the popular short-video app to be sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or banned on Sunday in the United States on national security grounds — a major blow to a platform used by nearly half of all Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  The justices unanimously ruled that the law, passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress last year and signed by Democratic President Joe Biden, did not violate the US Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgement of free speech. TikTok, ByteDance, and some of the app's users challenged the measure, prompting the justices to uphold a lower court's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary," the court said in the unsigned opinion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court added, "We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate the petitioners' First Amendment rights."
  <br>
  <br>
  The case pitted free speech rights against national security concerns in the age of social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Friday reiterated Biden's position that "TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law."
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the timing, Jean-Pierre added, action to implement the law "must fall to the next administration."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok plans to shut down US operations of the app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli security cabinet approved a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal on Friday, recommending the wider government give its final green light, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "After reviewing all the political, security and humanitarian aspects, and understanding that the proposed deal supports achieving the objectives of the war, (the security cabinet) has recommended that the government approve the proposed framework," the office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire is expected start on Sunday with the first hostages released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The security cabinet meeting came after Netanyahu’s office said there were last minute snags in finalising the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel had delayed a security cabinet vote on Thursday, blaming the dispute with Hamas for holding up approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a pre-dawn statement cleared the way for the deal to be voted on.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the deal expected to begin on Sunday, 33 hostages are set to be released over the next six weeks, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remainder, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. (Agencies)

    S Korea investigators try to extend Yoon's detention

<img alt="Police stand guard at the Seoul Detention Centre where South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol is being held. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788041_1_20250117185548.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators probing President Yoon Suk-yeol for alleged insurrection asked a Seoul court on Friday to extend his detention as the embattled leader again refused to be questioned.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Yoon became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested, in a criminal probe related to his short-lived declaration of martial law in early December. He is being held at the Seoul Detention Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In order to hold Yoon in custody for longer, investigators at the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) need a court to approve a detention warrant for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  A CIO official told a briefing on Friday that investigators had made the request due to "the gravity of the crime". Yoon's current arrest term was due to expire by Friday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seoul Central District Court struck down a challenge on Thursday from Yoon's lawyers over the legality of his arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement disseminated by his lawyer, Yoon said the jail cell where he is being held was "a little uncomfortable" but that he was doing well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked his supporters, hundreds of whom gathered outside the prison in chilly conditions, saying: "I am grateful for the people's burning patriotism."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has stonewalled efforts by the CIO to interrogate him while his party has capitalised on political polarisation to improve its approval ratings since his arrest, polling showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has fully stated his basic position on the first day (of the arrest), and we believe there is no reason or need to answer the Q&A style back-and-forth," Yoon's lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president's legal team has denied Yoon masterminded an insurrection, a crime in South Korea punishable by life imprisonment or even, technically, the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea is grappling with its worst political crisis in decades, sparked by Yoon's attempt to impose martial law on December 3 that stunned the nation and was swiftly voted down by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was impeached on December 14 and he faces a Constitutional Court trial that started this week to decide whether to permanently suspend his powers or return him to office. (Reuters)

    Russia jails lawyers of late dissident Navalny

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three lawyers who once represented the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny were jailed on Friday in Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vadim Kobzev, Igor Sergunin and Alexei Liptser were jailed from 3.5 to five years by a court in the town of Petushki, about 100 kilometres east of Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were arrested in October 2023 on charges of involvement with extremist groups, as Navalny’s networks were deemed extremist by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was widely seen as a way to increase pressure on the opposition to discourage defence lawyers from taking political cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time, Navalny was serving a 19-year prison term on several criminal convictions, including extremism.
  <br>
  <br>
  He died in a Russian prison camp in February 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and outspoken opponent of President Vladimir Putin, was arrested in 2021 upon his return from Germany, where he was recuperating from a nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was ordered to serve 2.5 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  After two more trials, his sentence was extended to 19 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his allies said the charges were politically motivated and accused the Kremlin of seeking to jail him for life.

  In December 2023, Navalny was moved from a penal colony in the Vladimir region east of Moscow to one above the Arctic Circle, where he died in February at the age of 47 under still-unexplained circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, and members of his team alleged he was killed on orders from the Kremlin.

  <br>
  The Russian government has rejected the accusation. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistan court on Friday convicted former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in a landmark graft case, sentencing Khan to 14 years in prison.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan has been held in custody since August 2023 charged with around 200 cases, but his party claim the latest conviction was being used to pressure him into silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief," Khan told reporters inside the court room after his conviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft court convened in the jail near the capital Islamabad where Khan is being held, and convicted him along with his wife over a welfare foundation they established together called the Al-Qadir Trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The prosecution has proven its case. Khan is convicted," said Judge Nasir Javed Rana, announcing a 14 year sentence for Khan and seven years for Bibi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faith healer Bibi, who was recently released on bail, was arrested at the court after the conviction, her spokeswoman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan maintains the cases are politically motivated and designed to keep him from returning to power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentence has been delayed several times over the past month, with analysts saying the jail term was being used to pressure Khan into accepting a deal with the military to step back from politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since being ousted from power in 2022, Khan has launched an unprecedented campaign in which he has openly criticised the country's powerful generals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan had previously been handed four convictions, two of which have been overturned while the sentences in the other two cases were suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he remained in prison over pending cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN panel of experts found last year that Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office".
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan was barred from standing in February's election and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were hamstrung by a widespread crackdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  PTI won more seats than any other party in the poll, but a coalition of parties considered more pliable to the influence of the military establishment shut them out of power. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian mother has been charged with poisoning her one-year-old baby girl and posting video of the infant's distress to get online GoFundMe donations, police and local media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old woman allegedly went to "great lengths" to conceal that she was giving prescription and pharmacy drugs to the baby without medical approval, Queensland detective inspector Paul Dalton told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital staff in the Queensland capital Brisbane alerted police to their suspicions in October last year when the girl was there for treatment of a serious mental condition, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police took "immediate action" to protect the baby and launched an investigation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman from Queensland's Sunshine Coast was widely reported in local media to be the baby's mother, though police would not officially confirm this.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was accused of filming and posting images of the baby's "immense distress and pain" between August and October last year to elicit financial donations from online followers, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Testing for unauthorised medicines allegedly returned a positive result this month, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was charged on Thursday with 11 offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no words to describe just how repulsive offences of this nature are," Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no excuse for hurting a child, particularly one so young that is totally dependent on adults to care and love for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman is accused of raising just over Aus$60,000 (US$37,000) via GoFundMe, which was working to return the money to donors, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was scheduled to appear at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Thursday accused Hamas of backtracking on parts of the Gaza ceasefire deal announced a day earlier, and said the cabinet will not meet on the deal until Hamas's agreement is confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has reneged on parts of the agreement reached with the mediators and Israel in an effort to extort last-minute concessions," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement, adding the situation created a "last minute crisis."
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not specify which parts of the deal were at issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the Israeli cabinet, which has yet to approve the agreement, "will not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Key mediator Qatar said on Wednesday that Israel and Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza starting on Sunday, along with a hostage and prisoner exchange after more than 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States also announced the deal, which largely reproduces the framework of a blueprint presented by President Joe Biden in May 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-three Israeli hostages will be released in the first, 42-day, phase of the agreement, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan was stabbed in a scuffle with an intruder at his home early on Thursday and underwent surgery at a hospital, media reports said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 54-year-old actor was taken to the hospital from his home in Mumbai, the country's financial and entertainment capital, where he lives with his movie star wife Kareena Kapoor and two sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the six wounds were deep, with one near his spine, the Press Trust of India news agency cited a doctor at Mumbai’s Lilavati Hospital as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian media quoted police as saying the intruder barged into the house at about 2.30am and fled after stabbing Khan.
  <br>
  <br>
  A female employee at Khan's home was also injured during the attack and was being treated, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are investigating and have launched a search for the attacker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kapoor, Khan' wife, said in a statement that his family was fine and requested “the media and fans to be patient and not speculate any further as the police is already doing their due investigations.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan, who is also a movie producer, has been featured in about 70 films and television series.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the son of former Indian cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won multiple awards for his roles in Hindi cinema, including seven Filmfare Awards. In 2010, he received the Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award. (AP)

    China welcomes Gaza ceasefire deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said it welcomed a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and the Hamas militant group, vowing "unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East".
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also sincerely hope that relevant parties will take the ceasefire in Gaza as an opportunity to promote the easing of regional tensions," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Qatar and the United States announced a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce would take effect on Sunday and involve the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, after which the terms of a broader peace deal would be finalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing on Thursday said it hoped the "agreement can be effectively implemented to achieve a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  China would "continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza and make positive efforts to resume post-war reconstruction," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will work with the international community to make unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, said the deal was the "right move" to bring back hostages seized during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  That attack, the deadliest in Israeli history, resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a media tallies of official Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's ensuing campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,707 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    First successful launch for Blue Origin rocket

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Blue Origin, the space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, launched its massive New Glenn rocket for the first time early on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rocket, whose inaugural mission had been delayed by several years, blasted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Base in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission is seen as critical to Blue Origin's efforts to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX, which dominates the commercial space industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "LIFTOFF! New Glenn is beginning its first ever ascent toward the stars," Blue Origin said on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "New Glenn has passed the Karman line, the internationally recognised boundary of space!" the firm posted just a few minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  And then: "Second stage engine cutoff confirmed. New Glenn's second stage and payload are now in orbit."
  <br>
  <br>
  An initial test launch of the towering 98-metre rocket, dubbed New Glenn in honour of the legendary American astronaut John Glenn, had been scrubbed early on Monday morning after repeated halts during the countdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company later said it had discovered an icing issue on a purge line and would aim for a possible early Tuesday morning launch, but that weather conditions were unfavourable.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday night, Blue Origin announced that launch had been postponed.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the mission, dubbed NG-1, Amazon founder Bezos is taking aim at the only man in the world wealthier than him: fellow tech innovator Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk's company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its prolific Falcon 9 rockets, which have become vital for the commercial sector, the Pentagon and Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town, and so having a competitor... this is great," G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior Nasa official, earlier told reporters, expecting the competition to drive down costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upping the high-stakes rivalry, SpaceX also plans another orbital test this week of Starship -- its gargantuan new-generation rocket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin will now attempt to land New Glenn's first-stage booster on a drone ship stationed about 1,000 kilometres downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX has made such landings now routine, but this will be Blue Origin's first shot at the sci-fi feat.
  <br>
  <br>
  High seas last week caused the New Glenn launch to be pushed back several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the rocket's upper stage will fire its engines toward Earth orbit, reaching a maximum altitude of roughly 12,000 miles above the surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Defence Department-funded prototype of an advanced spaceship called Blue Ring, which could one day journey through the solar system, will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin has experience landing its New Shepard rockets -- used for suborbital tourism -- but they are five times smaller and land on terra firma rather than a ship at sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Physically, the gleaming white New Glenn dwarfs SpaceX's 230-foot Falcon 9 and is designed for heavier payloads.
  <br>
  <br>
  It slots between Falcon 9 and its big sibling, Falcon Heavy, in terms of mass capacity but holds an edge with its wider payload fairing, capable of carrying the equivalent of 20 moving trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin has already secured a Nasa contract to launch two Mars probes aboard New Glenn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rocket will also support the deployment of Project Kuiper, a satellite Internet constellation designed to compete with Starlink.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, however, SpaceX maintains a commanding lead, while other rivals -- United Launch Alliance, Arianespace, and Rocket Lab -- trail far behind. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's arrested President Yoon Suk Yeol does not intend to take part in a second day of questioning on Thursday, his lawyer said, further stonewalling a criminal probe into whether he committed insurrection with his martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested, was taken to the Seoul Detention Centre on Wednesday evening after refusing to cooperate, where he was expected to have spent the night in a solitary cell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have 48 hours to question the suspended president, after which they must release him or seek a warrant to detain him for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's refusal to cooperate with investigators comes as the Constitutional Court is due to hold a second hearing in his impeachment trial to determine whether to remove him permanently or reinstate his presidential powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea is grappling with a political crisis sparked by Yoon's brief attempt to impose martial law on December 3 that was voted down by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's arrest on Wednesday ended a weeks-long standoff with authorities after police swooped before dawn on his fortified hillside villa in Seoul to the despair of followers at the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he turned himself in for questioning by corruption investigation officials to prevent what he called the risk of "unsavoury bloodshed", though he continued to protest that it was an illegal investigation and invalid arrest warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has up to now refused to talk with investigators who had prepared a questionnaire of more than 200 pages, an official from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) that is heading the criminal inquiry said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embattled leader did not even reply to a question, a CIO official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His questioning is due to resume at 2 pm local time, on Thursday, according to CIO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yoon Kab-keun, one of Yoon’s lawyers, said in a text message to reporters that Yoon would not show up for the questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap reported the same lawyer as citing Yoon's health as a factor and saying further questioning was pointless, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CIO official said he understood it was possible to forcibly bring Yoon for questioning but would make further checks on relevant laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small crowd of protesters supporting Yoon gathered and sat on a road outside the CIO office, calling the president's arrest illegitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opinion polls show a majority of South Koreans support impeaching Yoon, but the attempts to arrest him appear to have rallied his hardcore supporters. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Firefighters reported significant gains on Wednesday against the two massive wildfires burning around Los Angeles, while also extinguishing smaller blazes set by arsonists in recent days as a final round of windy, flame-fanning weather moved through Southern California.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Particularly Dangerous Situation red-flag warning expired in the afternoon, but dry conditions and gusty winds were forecast to linger into Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  So much of the nation’s second-most populous metropolitan region remained on alert for new outbreaks and flare-ups from the fires, which have killed at least 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Wednesday, gusts whipped up to 80 kph in the mountains, though many areas saw relatively light winds late in the morning, according to the National Weather Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Better conditions expected in the coming days should help fire crews make even more headway and allow residents to return to their neighbourhoods to begin rebuilding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, firefighters and police faced new challenges. Since the beginning of the wildfire outbreak last week, authorities have arrested about half a dozen people accused of setting new, small fires that were quickly knocked down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have not determined a cause for the major blazes in what is on track to become the nation’s costliest fire disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  More manageable winds on Tuesday allowed firefighters to make gains on the two most destructive fires. Almost half of the Eaton Fire just north of LA was contained, and one-fifth of the fire that destroyed much of the seaside neighbourhood of Pacific Palisades was surrounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of those broke out on January 7. (AP)

    Biden warns dangerous oligarchy taking shape in US

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden urged Americans on Wednesday to "stand guard" against threats from oligarchs, disinformation and AI in a future under Donald Trump as he delivered a dark farewell address ahead of stepping down next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden, who will be succeeded by Trump on Monday, touted his achievements in steering the US economy out of the deep crisis inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and said he had made the nation's alliances abroad stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, in his brief Oval Office speech on live television, the Democrat quickly turned to painting a series of dangers facing the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clearly referring to Trump's close ties to the world's richest man Elon Musk and other tech tycoons, Biden said an "oligarchy is taking shape in America" - and "a dangerous concentration of power."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the ultra-rich around Trump represented a concentration of "extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden recalled the stark warning issued by president Dwight Eisenhower in his own farewell address in 1961 about the dangers of an out-of-control military industrial complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech industrial complex," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And a "crumbling" media means Americans are increasingly vulnerable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power," the outgoing president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also clearly referring to Trump's plans to roll back environmental protections and withdraw from a major international global accord on combating global warming, Biden said "powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we've taken to tackle the climate crisis, to serve their own interest for power and profit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Naming another increasingly global challenge, Biden said artificial intelligence "is the most consequential technology of our time" that could bring huge benefits but also poses "risks for our economy and our security, our society." (AFP)

 UK patients are "coming to harm" as nurses say they are having to treat people in corridors and unsuitable places because of a "collapse in care standards", a report said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the latest indictment of Britain's beleaguered state-funded National Health Service, nine in 10 NHS nurses surveyed by the country's nurses union said "patient safety is being compromised".
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly seven in 10 said they were delivering care in "overcrowded or unsuitable places" on a "daily basis", including in corridors, converted cupboards, car parks and even bereavement rooms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The experiences of over 5,000 nursing staff across the UK highlight a devastating collapse in care standards, with patients routinely coming to harm," said the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).
  <br>
  <br>
  The report condemns the "normalisation" of so-called "corridor care", with nurses unable to access life-saving equipment in cramped spaces and patients even dying in corridors.
  <br>
  <br>
  One nurse in east England said corridor care in their hospital trust was "not an exception, it's the rule".
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, some 54,000 patients in emergency departments in England had to wait over 12 hours until a hospital bed was available, up 23 percent from December 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the RCN report testimonies are accounts of nurses treating up to 40 patients waiting in a corridor, as well as reports of pregnant women miscarrying in corridors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some reported overcrowded corridors impeding them from giving life-saving resuscitation (CPR). One nurse recalled a patient dying after a cardiac arrest "by the male toilet".
  <br>
  <br>
  Another alleged having to treat cardiac arrests "with no crash bell, crash trolley, oxygen, defibrillator... straddling a patient doing CPR while everyone watches on".
  <br>
  <br>
  There are some 7.5 million people on the NHS waiting list, with more than three million having faced delays longer than 18 weeks for treatment. (AFP)

    Indonesia to push social media protections

<img alt="Nearly 50 percent of children under 12 in tech-savvy Indonesia use the internet. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787715_1_20250115215818.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia is planning to impose interim child protection guidelines on social media companies while the government carves out a law to set a minimum age for users of the platforms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Communications minister Meutya Hafid has said the government plans to issue a regulation to set a minimum age for social media users, after discussing the proposal to protect children online with President Prabowo Subianto.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows Australia's decision to ban children under 16 from accessing social media, with fines for tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta to TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, if they fail to prevent children from accessing their platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the minister means is that the government is headed for the direction of a stronger regulation on age limit, which is through the formation of a law," said Alexander Sabar, a senior official at the communications and digital ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, he said the government will issue a regulation for digital platforms, including social media companies, to adhere to child protection guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The emphasis for the government regulation is child protection - how they are protected from physical, mental, or moral perils," he said, adding that the regulation would not totally limit children's access to social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nurmayanti, a 46-year-old mother of three, said she agreed with the plan to curtail social media content, particularly content promoting pornography or discrimination.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They now can freely open social media so that is concerning to us as parents," she said, adding the law must be strict and clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Anis Hidayah, a commissioner at Indonesia's main human rights body, said that limiting the internet for children was important but the government must be careful not to curb their right to information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 50 percent of children under 12 in tech-savvy Indonesia use the internet, with some respondents of that age group using Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, according to a survey by the Indonesia internet service providers' association. (Reuters)

    Thousands across Gaza celebrate ceasefire deal

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds of Gazans chanted and embraced on Wednesday as news spread that a ceasefire and hostage release deal had been reached between Israel and Hamas aimed at ending more than 15 months of war in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a US official and a source close to the negotiations first revealed the agreement, Israel cautioned that several points "remain unresolved" that it hoped would be addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But celebrations were already underway in Gaza, where journalists saw crowds of people hugging and taking photos to mark the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't believe that this nightmare of more than a year is finally coming to an end. We have lost so many people, we've lost everything," said Randa Sameeh, a 45-year-old who was displaced from Gaza City to the Nuseirat Camp in the centre of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need a lot of rest. As soon as the truce begins, I will go to the cemetery to visit my brother and family members. We buried them in Deir el-Balah cemetery without proper graves. We will build them new graves and write their names on them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside Deir al-Balah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where so many of the war's casualties have been taken, hundreds of Palestinians gathered to chant, sing and wave flags, AFPTV footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point, a member of the crowd and a journalist in body armour were raised on people's shoulders to conduct an interview above the mass of elated Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, The "final details" of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal are still being worked on, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in the early hours of Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to US President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to thank them for helping to secure a deal for the release of hostages held in Gaza, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least 20 people were killed in Israeli strikes after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was announced on Wednesday. (AFP)

    Drake sues Universal over Kendrick diss track

<img alt="Last year the two superstar rappers exchanged a litany of increasingly vitriolic diss tracks. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787739_1_20250116055306.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Drake on Wednesday filed suit against his own label, saying Universal Music Group's release and promotion of a Kendrick Lamar track dissing him amounted to defamation and harassment.
 <br>
  <br>
  UMG, which is behind both Drake and Lamar, adamantly denied the accusations, saying "the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist -- let alone Drake -- is illogical" given the company's longtime investment in helping him "achieve historic commercial and personal financial success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year the two superstar rappers exchanged a litany of increasingly vitriolic diss tracks, with Lamar delivering the major blow with his chart-topping, Grammy-nominated song "Not Like Us."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his suit, Drake said Universal betrayed him in favor of profits by promoting the song with punchlines that accuse him of pedophilia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the documents filed in Manhattan's federal court, Drake says Universal "approved, published, and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track" that was "intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian artist born Aubrey Drake Graham, 38, says the record company chose "corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawsuit cited the track's promotion as causing a "physical threat to Drake's safety" as well as a "bombardment of online harassment."
  <br>
  <br>
  It cited a pre-dawn shooting last May that saw a gunman wound a security guard at the superstar rapper's estate in Toronto, and described subsequent break-in attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These events were not coincidental," the suit said, before detailing the defamation allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake, the reigning highest-grossing rapper, is not taking legal action against Lamar, and he is not suing over the lyrics themselves. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal to halt fighting in Gaza and exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, an official briefed on the deal told Reuters on Wednesday, opening the way to a possible end to a 15-month war that has upended the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agreement follows months of on-off negotiations brokered by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, with the backing of the United States, and came just ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli troops invaded Gaza after Hamas-led gunmen broke through security barriers and burst into Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 and kidnapping more than 250 people.
  <br>

  Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 people, mostly women and children, and left the narrow coastal enclave a wasteland of rubble, with hundreds of thousands surviving the winter cold in tents and makeshift shelters.

  As his inauguration approached, Trump repeated his demand that a deal be done swiftly, warning repeatedly that there would be "hell to pay" if the hostages were not released. His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff worked with President Joe Biden's team to push the deal over the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, the return of the hostages may ease some of the public anger against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Oct. 7 security failure and not securing a hostage deal until now.

  The conflict spread across the Middle East, with groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen attacking Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. (Reuters)

 Ukrainian authorities in the west of the country on Wednesday said that critical infrastructure facilities had been targeted in a "massive" Russian missile attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Critical infrastructure facilities were targeted in Prykarpattia," the regional governor of the western Ivano-Frankivsk region wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Air defence forces were working in the region," the official, Svitlana Onyshchuk, said, adding there were no casualties and that the situation was "under control."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in the western Lviv region, which borders EU and Nato member Poland, said two critical infrastructure facilities had been hit in the Drogobych and Stryi districts, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fortunately, there were no casualties, but there was damage," governor Maksym Kozytsky wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian national grid operator meanwhile announced it was introducing emergency blackouts in seven regions including the eastern Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  The apparent barrage came just one day after Ukraine said it had carried out its largest aerial attack on Russian territory, hitting factories and energy hubs hundreds of miles from the front line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Defence Ministry confirmed the attack on Tuesday, accusing Ukraine of using US- and British-made long-range missiles and drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Wednesday, the ministry said that its forces had "carried out a group strike with precision-guided weapons and attack drones against critical gas and energy infrastructure supporting the work of Ukraine's military-industrial complex." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over insurrection accusations related to his December 3 martial law declaration, investigators said.
 <br>
  <br>
  A motorcade was seen leaving the gates of his hillside residence where Yoon has been holed up for weeks behind barbed wire barriers and a small army of personal security.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 3,000 police officers and anti-corruption investigators had gathered there before dawn, pushing through throngs of Yoon supporters and members of his ruling People Power Party who protested attempts to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers have argued attempts to detain Yoon are illegal and are designed to publicly humiliate him. The warrant investigators secured for his arrest is the first-ever issued against an incumbent South Korean president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has justified his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance against an "anti-state" opposition employing its legislative majority to thwart his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-corruption agency is leading a joint investigation with police and the military over whether Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an attempted rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law enforcement officers had sought to bring him into custody after he ignored several summons for questioning. (Agencies)

    New wildfire warnings issued as winds rise in LA

<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Southern Californians faced new wildfire warnings on Tuesday, and tens of thousands saw their power shut off as strong winds blew across the parched landscape around Los Angeles where two massive blazes have been burning for a week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Santa Ana winds that began gusting over the mountains before sunrise were forecast to continue until Wednesday morning with enough force to carry fire-sparking embers for miles and stoke new outbreaks in a region where at least 25 people have already been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Life threatening and destructive and widespread winds are already here,” LA city fire chief Kristin Crowley told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Southern California was under elevated fire risk, with crews on high alert from the Mexican border to Central California, far north of Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 90,000 households lost electricity as utilities shut off power to prevent their lines from sparking new blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weary and anxious residents were told to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police announced roughly 50 arrests, for looting, flying drones in fire zones, violating curfew and other crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest worry remained the threat from intense winds predicted to reach nearly hurricane force in some areas. Tuesday's forecast included a rare warning: The winds, combined with severely dry conditions, have created a “Particularly Dangerous Situation,” the National Weather service said, meaning that any new fire could explode in size.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gusts were forecast to pick up strength in the evening and into Wednesday before decreasing, and red-flag warnings from Central California to the Mexican border were to remain through most of Wednesday, weather service meteorologist Ariel Cohen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals while crews and fire engines deployed to particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials - who were criticised over their initial response - expressed confidence that the region was ready to face the new threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  With almost no rain in more than eight months, the brush-filled region has had more than a dozen wildfires this year, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just under 90,000 people in the county remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week. (AP)
