<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump was sworn in for a historic second term as US president on Monday, pledging a blitz of immediate orders on immigration and the US culture wars as he caps his extraordinary comeback.
 <br>
  <br>
  With one hand raised in the air and the other on a Bible given to him by his mother, the 47th US president solemnly took the oath of office beneath the huge Rotunda of the US Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump and outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden had earlier travelled by motorcade together to the Capitol, where the ceremony was being held indoors - and with a much smaller crowd - for the first time in decades due to frigid weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, they and their spouses met for a traditional tea at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Welcome home," Biden said to Trump as he and First Lady Jill Biden greeted their successors at the front door to the presidential residence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, was a political outsider at his first inauguration in 2017 as the 45th president, but this time around he is surrounded by America's wealthy and powerful.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man, Elon Musk, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and Google CEO Sundar Pichai all had prime seats in the Capitol alongside Trump's family and cabinet members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, who bankrolled Trump's election campaign to the tune of a quarter of a billion dollars and promotes far-right policies on the X social network, will lead a cost-cutting drive in the new administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump refused to attend Biden's 2021 inauguration after falsely claiming electoral fraud by the Democrat, this time Biden has been keen to restore the sense of tradition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden joined former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton at the Capitol. Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush were there but ex-first lady Michelle Obama pointedly stayed away. (AFP)

    Rapist and murderer of Indian doctor jailed for life

<img alt="Police stand guard at an entrance of Civil and Criminal Court during the verdict for the case of the rape and murder of an Indian doctor in Kolkata. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788348_1_20250120180810.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The rapist and murderer of an Indian doctor was sentenced to life in prison on Monday, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and widespread hospital strikes last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her weeping family had called for the convicted killer to be hanged and said they were "shocked" at the sentence, for a case that highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Judge Anirban Das said the case did not deserve the death penalty as it was not "the rarest of the rare cases", and ordered that Sanjoy Roy must spend his life behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata in August 2024 sparked outrage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy, 33, the lone accused in the case, was arrested a day after the victim's body was discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  The murder led to demands by doctors at government hospitals for additional security, with thousands of citizens in Kolkata and elsewhere in India joining doctors' protests in solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court last year ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the brutality of the killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of Roy, who pleaded not guilty and repeatedly insisted on his innocence was fast-tracked through India's normally glacial legal system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victim's mother, who was seated close to Roy when he was convicted on Saturday, has said the family wanted him to be hanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are shocked by the verdict", the victim's father told AFP, tears running down his face.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue our fight, and won't let investigations stop... Come what may, we will fight for justice." (AFP)

    SKorea central bank cuts forecasts due to Yoon crisis

<img alt="South Korea's central bank cuts its 2025 growth forecast due to the country's ongoing political crisis. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788281_1_20250120120734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's central bank on Monday said it had slashed its 2025 growth forecast because of the political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule on December 3, sending soldiers to parliament but lawmakers voted the measure down and later impeached the president, who is now being held for a criminal probe on insurrection charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He initially resisted arrest and has refused to cooperate with investigators and, when his detention was extended, his die-hard supporters attacked a court building on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unexpected declaration of martial law in early December, coupled with the ongoing political turmoil and the Jeju Air passenger plane disaster, significantly dampened economic sentiment," the Bank of Korea said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 crashed on December 29 in southwestern Muan airport, killing 179 people in the worst ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The political turmoil and crash "led to contractions in domestic consumption and construction investment, likely causing the fourth-quarter growth rate to fall well below the November projection", the bank said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumption, which had shown improvement in the third quarter, appeared to weaken again in the fourth quarter," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, the bank's Monetary Policy Committee revised down its estimate for the last quarter of 2024, from 2.2 percent to a range of 2.0-2.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had projected 1.9 percent growth for 2025, but "the forecast has been revised downward to 1.6-1.7 percent", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This adjustment is primarily attributed to the impact of political uncertainty triggered by the declaration of martial law last December, which has dampened economic sentiment," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is estimated to reduce this year's growth rate by approximately 0.2 percentage points, particularly affecting domestic consumption and other areas of domestic demand," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is the first sitting South Korean president ever to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Yoon behind bars, prosecutors are due to formalise a criminal indictment for insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could be jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon refused to attend questioning on Monday, his lawyers said, with the Corruption Investigation Office -- the body in charge of the probe -- saying it was looking at whether to compel him to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has also been absent from the parallel probe at the Constitutional Court, which is considering whether to uphold his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If that court rules against him, Yoon will formally lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Han Zheng on Sunday told American Vice President-elect JD Vance that there is a lot of room for China-US cooperation, in a meeting ahead of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han told Vance that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to "implement the important consensus reached between President Xi Jinping and US president-elect Donald Trump", Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, who is in the US for the inauguration ceremony, also told Vance that the nation is ready to promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, Han also said both sides could make contributions to world peace and development, as long as they adhere to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Economic and trade relations are important issues of common concern to both sides. While there are differences and friction between China and the US, there are many common interests, and the space for cooperation between the two nations is huge. The two sides should strengthen dialogue and negotiations on this front," Han was quoted by Xinhua as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting came a day before Trump and Vance will be sworn in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also reported that Han met Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who became a key Trump ally during his campaign, and other representatives of the business community in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his meeting with Musk, Han said Beijing welcomes US companies, including Tesla, "to seize the opportunity and share the fruits of China's development" while making greater contributions in promoting China-US economic and trade relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, according to Xinhua, told Han that his company is ready to increase its investments in and cooperation with China and play a role in promoting bilateral economic and trade exchanges.

    Trump vows to end 'American decline'

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a rally the day before his inauguration as Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk gestures. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788274_1_20250120110649.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump pledged a blitz of presidential actions to end "American decline," telling a fired-up inauguration eve rally on Sunday he would crack down on woke ideology and immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a raucous campaign-style gathering in Washington, the 78-year-old Republican promised cheering supporters that he would act with "historic speed" from day one of his White House comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand new day of American strength and prosperity," Trump told a packed sports arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will act with historic speed and strength and fix every single crisis facing our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was joined on stage by Elon Musk -- the tech tycoon who will lead a major cost-cutting drive in his administration -- and who vowed to make America strong "for centuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Then at the end the rally Trump danced alongside the disco band Village People as they performed their 1970s hit "YMCA" which became the unofficial anthem of his election campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Trump's hour-long speech focused on immigration, driving home one of the dark messages that helped spur his remarkable victory in November's presidential election over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to stop the invasion of our borders," added Trump, who has pledged to launch raids targeting undocumented migrants within days of taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Trump effect" has already been on display, with TikTok crediting his "clarity" for being able to restore service in the United States after briefly going dark due to a ban on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to save TikTok," Trump told the rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also promised "lots" of executive orders from his first day back in the Oval Office, including one to ban "transgender insanity" and critical race theory from schools and to keep trans athletes out of women's sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also reiterated a promise to release files on the assassinations of former president John F Kennedy, his brother Bobby Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long lines of Trump supporters formed outside the arena despite snowy conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the future US commander-in-chief paid a highly symbolic visit to Arlington National Cemetery, the resting place of America's war dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, followed by Vice President-elect JD Vance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sombre ceremony contrasted with Trump's last trip to the cemetery as a presidential candidate in August, when the US army criticised his staff for pushing a cemetery employee.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump's hopes for a huge crowd to see his inauguration at the US Capitol on Monday took a blow, however, when forecasts of below freezing weather prompted organisers to move the ceremony indoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of being sworn in on the steps of the Capitol, Trump will now take the oath under the massive dome of its Rotunda, last used for the ceremony 40 years ago during the inauguration of Ronald Reagan. (AFP)

    Freed Israeli hostages reunited with mothers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinians burst into streets to celebrate and began returning to the rubble of bombed-out homes on Sunday after a ceasefire deal halted fighting in Gaza, while three female hostages freed by Hamas were reunited with their mothers inside Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters drove through the southern city of Khan Younis with crowds cheering and chanting. In the north of the territory, bombed into oblivion in the war's most intense fighting, people picked their way on narrow roads through a devastated landscape of rubble and twisted metal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like at last I found some water to drink after being lost in the desert for 15 months," said Aya, a displaced woman from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for over a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tel Aviv, hundreds of Israelis in a square outside the defence headquarters watched a live broadcast from Gaza showing the hostage release on a giant screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd cheered, embraced and wept as three female hostages could be seen getting into a Red Cross vehicle surrounded by armed Hamas fighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after, the Israeli military said Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari had been reunited with their mothers at a meeting point inside Israel, close to the kibbutz and nearby music festival where they had been abducted in the October 7, 2023 Hamas raid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three appeared in good health in a video later released by the military. Damari, who lost two fingers when she was shot the day she was abducted, could be seen smiling and embracing her mother as she held up a bandaged hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like you to tell them: Romi, Doron and Emily – an entire nation embraces you. Welcome home," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a commander by phone as the hostages were driven across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, buses awaited the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli detention. Hamas said the first group to be freed in exchange for the hostages includes 69 women and 21 teenage boys.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the truce in the 15-month-old war between Israel and Hamas took effect following a three-hour delay during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  That last-minute Israeli blitz killed 13 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israel blamed Hamas for being late to deliver the names of hostages it would free, and said it had struck terrorists. Hamas said the holdup in providing the list was technical.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today the guns in Gaza have gone silent," US President Joe Biden said on his last full day in office, welcoming a truce that had eluded US diplomacy for more than a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a long road," Biden said. "But we've reached this point today because of the pressure Israel built on Hamas, backed by the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce calls for fighting to stop, aid to be sent in to Gaza and 33 of nearly 100 Israeli and foreign hostages to go free over the six-week first phase in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. (Reuters)

 TikTok said on Sunday it was restoring its service after US President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the United States when he returns to power on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As a result of president Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the US," the platform said in a message to users.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok also issued an earlier statement after US users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website, while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive."
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok stopped working for US users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like the United States to have a 50 percent ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of Palestinians burst into the streets across Gaza as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on Sunday, some in celebration, others to visit the graves of relatives, while many rushed back to see what remained of their homes.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like at last I found some water to drink after getting lost in the desert for 15 months. I feel alive again," Aya, a displaced woman from Gaza City, who has been sheltering in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for over a year, told Reuters via a chat app.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the north of the territory, where some of the most intense Israeli airstrikes and battles with the militants took place, hundreds of people picked their way through a devastated landscape of rubble and twisted metal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armed Hamas fighters drove through the southern city of Khan Younis, with crowds cheering and chanting, despite an almost three-hour delay in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, which follows 15 months of devastating conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas policemen, dressed in blue police uniform, deployed in some areas after months of trying to keep out of sight to avoid Israeli airstrikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who had gathered to cheer the fighters chanted "Greetings to Al-Qassam Brigades" - the armed wing of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the resistance factions are staying in spite of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu," one fighter told Reuters, referring to the armed wing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a ceasefire, a full and comprehensive one God willing, and there will be no return to war in spite of him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire deal took effect after a nearly three-hour delay, pausing a war that has brought seismic political change to the Middle East and giving hope to Gaza's 2.3 million people, many of whom have been displaced several times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said Israeli military strikes killed at least 13 people in attacks across the enclave during the delay. No more attacks were reported after it took effect at 11.15 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now waiting for the day when we head back to our home in Gaza City," Aya said. "Damaged or not, it doesn't matter, the nightmare of death and starvation is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  The streets in the shattered Gaza City in the north of the territory were already busy with groups of people waving the Palestinian flag and filming the scenes on their mobile phones. Several carts loaded with household possessions travelled down a thoroughfare scattered with rubble and debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Ayham, 40, sheltering with his family in Khan Younis, said the scene of destruction in his home city was "dreadful", adding that while the ceasefire may have spared lives it was no time for celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are in pain, deep pain and it is time that we hug one another and cry," Abu Ayham said via the same app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The highly anticipated ceasefire deal could help usher in an end to the Gaza war, which began after Hamas, which controls the tiny coastal territory, attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's response has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed nearly 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza-based health officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long lines of trucks carrying fuel and aid supplies queued up at border crossings in the hours before the ceasefire was due to take effect. The World Food Programme said they began to cross on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal requires 600 truckloads of aid to be allowed into Gaza every day of the initial six-week ceasefire, including 50 carrying fuel. Half of the 600 aid trucks would be delivered to Gaza's north, where experts have warned famine is imminent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The war ended, but life isn't going to be better because of the destruction and the losses we suffered," Aya said. "But at least there will be no more bloodshed of women and children, I hope." (Reuters)

    Israel says truce with Hamas begins, after delay

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Sunday said a truce with Hamas began in Gaza at 5.15pm Hong Kong time, nearly three hours after initially scheduled, following a last-minute delay on the orders of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu had said the ceasefire could not take effect until Hamas gave the names of the hostages up for release on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least eight Palestinians died from Israeli attacks that occurred between the period when the ceasefire was meant to begin until it actually took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, which ultimately published the names of three Israeli women to be released, attributed the delay in producing the names to "technical reasons", as well as the "complexities of the field situation and the continued bombing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel then confirmed it had received the list, adding that four other living female hostages would be freed in seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, thousands of displaced Gazans carrying tents, clothes and personal belongings began heading to their homes after the ceasefire took effect following more than 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinians were seen travelling by truck, donkey cart and on foot back to their homes through devastated swathes of Gaza, particularly in the northern parts of the Palestinian territory. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A long-awaited ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war was delayed on Sunday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the last minute that it would not take effect until the Palestinian militant group provided a list of the hostages to be released.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, while "affirming its commitment" to the terms of the ceasefire, said: "The delay in providing the names of those to be released in the first batch is due to technical reasons."
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from Netanyahu's office, issued less than an hour before the truce was to start, said he had "instructed the IDF (military) that the ceasefire... will not begin until Israel has received the list".
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial exchange was to see three Israeli hostages released from captivity in return for a first group of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the ceasefire goes ahead, a total of 33 hostages taken by militants during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel will be returned from Gaza during an initial 42-day truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the deal, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is intended to pave the way for an end to more than 15 months of war sparked by the October 7 attack, the deadliest in Israeli history.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a deal struck by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of negotiations, and takes effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had US support to return to war if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling the 42-day first phase a "temporary ceasefire", he said: "If we are forced to resume the war, we will do so with force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting continued right up to the eve of the truce, with Gaza's civil defence agency saying that at least five members of one family were killed when an Israeli strike hit their tent in the southern city of Khan Yunis. (AFP)

<img alt="Under a law passed last year, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788182_1_20250119110315.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 11.45am Hong Kong time on Sunday: "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to US national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court extended the detention of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Sunday over concerns he could destroy evidence linked to his martial law declaration, enraging his supporters who attacked the court building.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of pro-Yoon protesters smashed windows and broke down doors to enter the court after the decision was announced, chanting the name of the president, who plunged South Korea into its worst political chaos in decades with his bid to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's December 3 martial law declaration lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them. He was impeached soon after and suspended from duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was detained in a dawn raid on Wednesday on insurrection charges after he refused investigators' summons and went to ground in his residence, using his presidential security detail to resist arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon had also refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The disgraced leader, who attended court for the first time on Saturday over his case, will now remain in custody, with the new warrant allowing investigators to keep him for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer Seok Dong-hyeon slammed the court decision, but also warned the president's supporters not to escalate the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is likely not what President Yoon desires," he said in a statement, adding violence could also "create burdens" for the president's future trials. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A ceasefire in the Gaza war begins on Sunday morning, mediator Qatar said, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to bring back "all the hostages" held in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The truce is intended to end more than 15 months of fighting and devastating bombardment, but in a televised address on Saturday evening, the hawkish premier stressed Israel had US support to return to war if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an initial 42-day ceasefire, Palestinian militant groups will hand over 33 hostages, three of them on Sunday, and Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, some of whom will be deported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since mediators Qatar and the United States, which brokered the deal along with Egypt, announced the details on Wednesday, Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Gaza's civil defence rescue agency said at least five members of one family were killed when a strike hit their tent in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions were heard over Jerusalem as Yemen's Huthi rebels launched a barrage of missiles at Israel in a show of support for the Palestinians ahead of the truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Huthis said they targeted the defence ministry in Tel Aviv and also fired two missiles at the Red Sea port city of Eilat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani told Sky News the framework signed this week was the same as one agreed in December 2023, adding it amounted to 13 months of "waste".
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is to take effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration for a second term as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told US network NBC on Saturday that he had told Netanyahu that the war "has to end". "We want it to end, but to keep doing what has to be done," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh on Saturday detained a second person suspected of involvement in a knife attack in which Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was wounded.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan, 54, was stabbed six times by an intruder during a burglary attempt at his home in Mumbai early on Thursday. He had surgery after sustaining stab wounds to his spine, neck and hands, and is out of danger, doctors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got information from Mumbai Police that a suspect is travelling by Jnaneswari Express train," Sanjeev Sinha, a representative of the Railway Protection Force, told the ANI news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "...Mumbai Police officials were contacted through video call and the suspect's identity was confirmed. He has been detained," Sinha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in India's financial capital of Mumbai had on Friday detained another key suspect in the knife attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack on Khan, one of Bollywood's most bankable and well-known actors, shocked the film industry and Mumbai residents, with many calling for better policing and security. (Reuters)

 Two judges were killed in a shooting attack on Saturday at the Supreme Court building in Tehran, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Three judges of the Supreme Court were targeted. Two of them were martyred," the Judiciary's Mizan Online website reported, adding that the "assailant killed himself."
  <br>
  <br>
  State news agency IRNA also reported that one other person was injured in the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizan identified the two slain judges as Ali Razini and Mohammad Moghisseh, adding that they worked on cases "fighting crimes against national security, espionage and terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  The motive behind their killing was not immediately clear, but Mizan said the assailant was not involved in any cases before the Supreme Court, without providing further details on the attacker's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said an investigation into the incident was launched, Mizan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran judge Moghisseh, 68, was sanctioned in 2019 by the United States for having "overseen countless unfair trails, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded," according to the US Department of the Treasury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Razini, 71, held several important positions in Iran's judiciary and was previously targeted in a 1998 assassination attempt by assailants "who planted a magnetic bomb on his vehicle," according to Mizan.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August 2005, renowned Iranian judge Hassan Moghaddas was murdered by two gunmen who climbed into his car in the middle of a busy business district in Tehran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two men convicted over his killing were publicly executed by hanging two years later. (AFP)

    Indian court finds man guilty in hospital rape case

<img alt="A crowd of protesters are demanding he be given the death penalty. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788134_1_20250118181325.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian court on Saturday found a 33-year-old man guilty of the rape and murder of a doctor, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and hospital strikes last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the victim's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata last August once again highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  It led to demands by doctors at government hospitals for additional security, with thousands of citizens in Kolkata and elsewhere in India joining the doctors' protests in solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of defendant Sanjoy Roy was fast-tracked through India's normally glacial legal system and arguments in the case concluded a little over a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sentence will be delivered on Monday," presiding judge Anirban Das said after finding Roy, a civic volunteer in the hospital, guilty of rape and murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy has consistently maintained his innocence and again told the court that he was not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have been framed," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy was brought to court by a prison van and greeted by a crowd of protesters, held at bay by police officers, demanding he be given the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hang him, hang him," they chanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentiment was echoed by the victim's family, none of whom have been identified in keeping with Indian law around the reporting of sexual violence cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The common man will lose faith in the judiciary if he is not handed down the death penalty," said the victim's mother, seated just a few metres from Roy when the verdict was read out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her father added: "He brutally snuffed out the life of our daughter. He deserves the same fate."
  <br>
  <br>
  The trainee doctor was found raped and murdered in a seminar room of the hospital last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crime led to nationwide outrage and prolonged protests by doctors across the state, demanding justice for the victim and stronger security measures in government hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy was arrested a day after the victim's body was discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court set up a national task force after the protests that suggested ways to enhance safety measures in government hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gruesome nature of the attack drew comparisons with the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, which also sparked weeks of nationwide protests. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was in court for the first time on Saturday for a crucial hearing that will decide whether to extend his detention as investigators probe his failed martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's supporters rallied outside the court and scuffled with police as he arrived in a blue van, weeks after throwing the nation into chaos by attempting to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's December 3 martial law bid lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was subsequently impeached by parliament and resisted arrest for weeks, holed up in his guarded residence until he was finally detained on Wednesday in a dawn raid.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the disgraced president remains in custody after investigators requested a new warrant on Friday to extend his detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  He decided to appear in court "with the intention of restoring his honour," the president's lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said before the hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Seoul Western District Court later confirmed that the hearing commenced with the president in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  After reviewing the request to extend Yoon's detention, a judge is expected to announce her decision on Saturday night or early on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the court, crowds of Yoon's backers waving flags and holding "release the president" placards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police officers formed a chain to prevent them reaching the court entrance, which has been closed to the public since Friday evening over safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  If approved, as expected, the new warrant would likely extend Yoon's detention by 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would give prosecutors time to formalise an indictment for insurrection, a charge that could see him jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  If indicted, the president would probably be detained for the duration of the trial. (AFP)

    Israeli government approves Gaza ceasefire deal

<img alt="For these starving Palestinians the truce cannot come fast enough. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788118_1_20250118141650.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's cabinet voted to approve a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal on Saturday, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ending days of uncertainty about whether the truce would go into effect this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip will take effect at 0630 GMT on Sunday morning, Qatar, which helped mediate the deal, said on Saturday, and would halt the fighting and bombardment in Gaza's deadliest-ever war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would also enable the release of hostages held in the territory since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has approved the hostage return plan," Netanyahu's office said early on Saturday morning after the cabinet held its vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's justice ministry has said 737 prisoners and detainees will be freed as part of the first phase of the deal – none before 4:00 pm local time (1400 GMT) on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli strikes have killed dozens since the ceasefire deal was announced, with the military saying on Thursday it had hit about 50 targets across Gaza over the previous 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is to take effect on the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump, who claimed credit for working with outgoing US President Joe Biden's team to seal the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was earlier approved by Israel's security cabinet, with Netanyahu's office saying it "supports achieving the objectives of the war."
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinian Authority has completed preparations "to assume full responsibility in Gaza" after the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even before the truce begins, displaced Gazans were preparing to return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will go to kiss my land," said Nasr al-Gharabli, who fled his home in Gaza City for a camp further south. "If I die on my land, it would be better than being here as a displaced person."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, there was joy but also anguish over the remaining hostages taken in the Hamas attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kfir Bibas, whose second birthday falls on Saturday, is the youngest hostage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas said in November 2023 that Kfir, his four-year-old brother Ariel and their mother Shiri had died in an air strike, but with the Israeli military yet to confirm their deaths, many are clinging to hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think of them, these two little redheads, and I get shivers," said 70-year-old Osnat Nyska, whose grandchildren attended nursery with the Bibas brothers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two far-right ministers had voiced opposition to the deal, with one threatening to quit the cabinet, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said before the vote he believed the ceasefire would proceed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident, and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said Israel pounded several areas of the territory, killing more than 100 people and wounding hundreds more since the deal was announced on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, warned that Israeli strikes were risking the lives of hostages and could turn their "freedom... into a tragedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 7, 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 people taken hostage, 94 are still in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,876 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the UN considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire agreement followed intensified efforts by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of fruitless negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the days of talks, Biden pointman Brett McGurk was joined in the region by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff in an unusual pairing to get the deal over the line, US officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we weren't involved... the deal would've never happened," Trump said in an interview on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, announcing the agreement on Wednesday, said an initial 42-day ceasefire would see 33 hostages released.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, he said: "We seek a full implementation of the first phase, and for the second phase to be the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are waiting for the Security Council to issue a binding resolution to implement the agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli authorities assume the 33 are alive, but Hamas has yet to confirm that.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also in the first phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza's densely populated areas and allow displaced Palestinians to return "to their residences," the Qatari prime minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two sources close to Hamas said three Israeli women soldiers would be the first to be released on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women may, in fact, be civilians, as the militant group refers to all Israelis of military age who have undergone mandatory military service as soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli military official said reception points had been established at Kerem Shalom, Erez and Reim, where hostages would be joined by doctors and mental health specialists before being "transported via helicopter or vehicle" to hospitals in Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel "is then expected to release the first group of Palestinian prisoners, including several with high sentences," a source said on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During talks on Friday, negotiators agreed to form a joint operations room in Cairo to "ensure effective coordination" and compliance with the truce terms, Egyptian state-linked media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron said French-Israeli citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi were among the hostages due to be freed in the first phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden said the second phase could bring a "permanent end to the war."
  <br>
  <br>
  In aid-starved Gaza, where nearly all of its 2.4 million people have been displaced at least once, humanitarian workers worry about the monumental task ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything has been destroyed, children are on the streets, you can't pinpoint just one priority," said Doctors Without Borders coordinator Amande Bazerolle. (AFP)

 US President-elect Donald Trump said his inauguration will be held inside the US Capitol rather than outdoors because of severe cold.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The weather forecast for Washington, DC, with the wind chill factor, could take temperatures into severe record lows. There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don't want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way," Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, I have ordered the Inauguration Address, in addition to prayers and other speeches, to be delivered in the United States Capitol Rotunda," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump referred to the last time an inauguration was moved indoors because of the cold - former Republican President Ronald Reagan's second swearing-in in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said supporters can view the ceremony on screens inside the Capital One Arena, a sports venue in downtown Washington that holds 20,000 people. (Reuters)

    US Supreme Court upholds TikTok ban

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court refused to rescue TikTok on Friday from a law that requires the popular short-video app to be sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or banned on Sunday in the United States on national security grounds — a major blow to a platform used by nearly half of all Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  The justices unanimously ruled that the law, passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress last year and signed by Democratic President Joe Biden, did not violate the US Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgement of free speech. TikTok, ByteDance, and some of the app's users challenged the measure, prompting the justices to uphold a lower court's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary," the court said in the unsigned opinion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court added, "We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate the petitioners' First Amendment rights."
  <br>
  <br>
  The case pitted free speech rights against national security concerns in the age of social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Friday reiterated Biden's position that "TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law."
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the timing, Jean-Pierre added, action to implement the law "must fall to the next administration."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok plans to shut down US operations of the app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli security cabinet approved a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal on Friday, recommending the wider government give its final green light, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "After reviewing all the political, security and humanitarian aspects, and understanding that the proposed deal supports achieving the objectives of the war, (the security cabinet) has recommended that the government approve the proposed framework," the office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire is expected start on Sunday with the first hostages released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The security cabinet meeting came after Netanyahu’s office said there were last minute snags in finalising the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel had delayed a security cabinet vote on Thursday, blaming the dispute with Hamas for holding up approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a pre-dawn statement cleared the way for the deal to be voted on.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the deal expected to begin on Sunday, 33 hostages are set to be released over the next six weeks, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remainder, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. (Agencies)

    S Korea investigators try to extend Yoon's detention

<img alt="Police stand guard at the Seoul Detention Centre where South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol is being held. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788041_1_20250117185548.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators probing President Yoon Suk-yeol for alleged insurrection asked a Seoul court on Friday to extend his detention as the embattled leader again refused to be questioned.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Yoon became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested, in a criminal probe related to his short-lived declaration of martial law in early December. He is being held at the Seoul Detention Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In order to hold Yoon in custody for longer, investigators at the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) need a court to approve a detention warrant for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  A CIO official told a briefing on Friday that investigators had made the request due to "the gravity of the crime". Yoon's current arrest term was due to expire by Friday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seoul Central District Court struck down a challenge on Thursday from Yoon's lawyers over the legality of his arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement disseminated by his lawyer, Yoon said the jail cell where he is being held was "a little uncomfortable" but that he was doing well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked his supporters, hundreds of whom gathered outside the prison in chilly conditions, saying: "I am grateful for the people's burning patriotism."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has stonewalled efforts by the CIO to interrogate him while his party has capitalised on political polarisation to improve its approval ratings since his arrest, polling showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has fully stated his basic position on the first day (of the arrest), and we believe there is no reason or need to answer the Q&A style back-and-forth," Yoon's lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president's legal team has denied Yoon masterminded an insurrection, a crime in South Korea punishable by life imprisonment or even, technically, the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea is grappling with its worst political crisis in decades, sparked by Yoon's attempt to impose martial law on December 3 that stunned the nation and was swiftly voted down by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was impeached on December 14 and he faces a Constitutional Court trial that started this week to decide whether to permanently suspend his powers or return him to office. (Reuters)

    Russia jails lawyers of late dissident Navalny

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three lawyers who once represented the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny were jailed on Friday in Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vadim Kobzev, Igor Sergunin and Alexei Liptser were jailed from 3.5 to five years by a court in the town of Petushki, about 100 kilometres east of Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were arrested in October 2023 on charges of involvement with extremist groups, as Navalny’s networks were deemed extremist by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was widely seen as a way to increase pressure on the opposition to discourage defence lawyers from taking political cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time, Navalny was serving a 19-year prison term on several criminal convictions, including extremism.
  <br>
  <br>
  He died in a Russian prison camp in February 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and outspoken opponent of President Vladimir Putin, was arrested in 2021 upon his return from Germany, where he was recuperating from a nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was ordered to serve 2.5 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  After two more trials, his sentence was extended to 19 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his allies said the charges were politically motivated and accused the Kremlin of seeking to jail him for life.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December 2023, Navalny was moved from a penal colony in the Vladimir region east of Moscow to one above the Arctic Circle, where he died in February at the age of 47 under still-unexplained circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, and members of his team alleged he was killed on orders from the Kremlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian government has rejected the accusation. (AP)

    Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan jailed for 14 years

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistan court on Friday convicted former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in a landmark graft case, sentencing Khan to 14 years in prison.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan has been held in custody since August 2023 charged with around 200 cases, but his party claim the latest conviction was being used to pressure him into silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief," Khan told reporters inside the court room after his conviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft court convened in the jail near the capital Islamabad where Khan is being held, and convicted him along with his wife over a welfare foundation they established together called the Al-Qadir Trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The prosecution has proven its case. Khan is convicted," said Judge Nasir Javed Rana, announcing a 14 year sentence for Khan and seven years for Bibi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faith healer Bibi, who was recently released on bail, was arrested at the court after the conviction, her spokeswoman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan maintains the cases are politically motivated and designed to keep him from returning to power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentence has been delayed several times over the past month, with analysts saying the jail term was being used to pressure Khan into accepting a deal with the military to step back from politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since being ousted from power in 2022, Khan has launched an unprecedented campaign in which he has openly criticised the country's powerful generals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan had previously been handed four convictions, two of which have been overturned while the sentences in the other two cases were suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he remained in prison over pending cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN panel of experts found last year that Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office".
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan was barred from standing in February's election and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were hamstrung by a widespread crackdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  PTI won more seats than any other party in the poll, but a coalition of parties considered more pliable to the influence of the military establishment shut them out of power. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian mother has been charged with poisoning her one-year-old baby girl and posting video of the infant's distress to get online GoFundMe donations, police and local media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old woman allegedly went to "great lengths" to conceal that she was giving prescription and pharmacy drugs to the baby without medical approval, Queensland detective inspector Paul Dalton told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital staff in the Queensland capital Brisbane alerted police to their suspicions in October last year when the girl was there for treatment of a serious mental condition, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police took "immediate action" to protect the baby and launched an investigation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman from Queensland's Sunshine Coast was widely reported in local media to be the baby's mother, though police would not officially confirm this.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was accused of filming and posting images of the baby's "immense distress and pain" between August and October last year to elicit financial donations from online followers, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Testing for unauthorised medicines allegedly returned a positive result this month, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was charged on Thursday with 11 offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no words to describe just how repulsive offences of this nature are," Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no excuse for hurting a child, particularly one so young that is totally dependent on adults to care and love for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman is accused of raising just over Aus$60,000 (US$37,000) via GoFundMe, which was working to return the money to donors, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was scheduled to appear at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday. (AFP)

    Israel accuses Hamas of 'reneging' on parts of deal

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Thursday accused Hamas of backtracking on parts of the Gaza ceasefire deal announced a day earlier, and said the cabinet will not meet on the deal until Hamas's agreement is confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has reneged on parts of the agreement reached with the mediators and Israel in an effort to extort last-minute concessions," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement, adding the situation created a "last minute crisis."
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not specify which parts of the deal were at issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the Israeli cabinet, which has yet to approve the agreement, "will not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Key mediator Qatar said on Wednesday that Israel and Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza starting on Sunday, along with a hostage and prisoner exchange after more than 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States also announced the deal, which largely reproduces the framework of a blueprint presented by President Joe Biden in May 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-three Israeli hostages will be released in the first, 42-day, phase of the agreement, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said. (AFP)

 Indian Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan was stabbed in a scuffle with an intruder at his home early on Thursday and underwent surgery at a hospital, media reports said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 54-year-old actor was taken to the hospital from his home in Mumbai, the country's financial and entertainment capital, where he lives with his movie star wife Kareena Kapoor and two sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the six wounds were deep, with one near his spine, the Press Trust of India news agency cited a doctor at Mumbai’s Lilavati Hospital as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian media quoted police as saying the intruder barged into the house at about 2.30am and fled after stabbing Khan.
  <br>
  <br>
  A female employee at Khan's home was also injured during the attack and was being treated, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are investigating and have launched a search for the attacker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kapoor, Khan' wife, said in a statement that his family was fine and requested “the media and fans to be patient and not speculate any further as the police is already doing their due investigations.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan, who is also a movie producer, has been featured in about 70 films and television series.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the son of former Indian cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won multiple awards for his roles in Hindi cinema, including seven Filmfare Awards. In 2010, he received the Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award. (AP)

    China welcomes Gaza ceasefire deal

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said it welcomed a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and the Hamas militant group, vowing "unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East".
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also sincerely hope that relevant parties will take the ceasefire in Gaza as an opportunity to promote the easing of regional tensions," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Qatar and the United States announced a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce would take effect on Sunday and involve the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, after which the terms of a broader peace deal would be finalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing on Thursday said it hoped the "agreement can be effectively implemented to achieve a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  China would "continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza and make positive efforts to resume post-war reconstruction," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will work with the international community to make unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, said the deal was the "right move" to bring back hostages seized during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  That attack, the deadliest in Israeli history, resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a media tallies of official Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's ensuing campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,707 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    First successful launch for Blue Origin rocket
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Blue Origin, the space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, launched its massive New Glenn rocket for the first time early on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rocket, whose inaugural mission had been delayed by several years, blasted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Base in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission is seen as critical to Blue Origin's efforts to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX, which dominates the commercial space industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "LIFTOFF! New Glenn is beginning its first ever ascent toward the stars," Blue Origin said on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "New Glenn has passed the Karman line, the internationally recognised boundary of space!" the firm posted just a few minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  And then: "Second stage engine cutoff confirmed. New Glenn's second stage and payload are now in orbit."
  <br>
  <br>
  An initial test launch of the towering 98-metre rocket, dubbed New Glenn in honour of the legendary American astronaut John Glenn, had been scrubbed early on Monday morning after repeated halts during the countdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company later said it had discovered an icing issue on a purge line and would aim for a possible early Tuesday morning launch, but that weather conditions were unfavourable.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday night, Blue Origin announced that launch had been postponed.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the mission, dubbed NG-1, Amazon founder Bezos is taking aim at the only man in the world wealthier than him: fellow tech innovator Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk's company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its prolific Falcon 9 rockets, which have become vital for the commercial sector, the Pentagon and Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town, and so having a competitor... this is great," G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior Nasa official, earlier told reporters, expecting the competition to drive down costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upping the high-stakes rivalry, SpaceX also plans another orbital test this week of Starship -- its gargantuan new-generation rocket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin will now attempt to land New Glenn's first-stage booster on a drone ship stationed about 1,000 kilometres downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX has made such landings now routine, but this will be Blue Origin's first shot at the sci-fi feat.
  <br>
  <br>
  High seas last week caused the New Glenn launch to be pushed back several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the rocket's upper stage will fire its engines toward Earth orbit, reaching a maximum altitude of roughly 12,000 miles above the surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Defence Department-funded prototype of an advanced spaceship called Blue Ring, which could one day journey through the solar system, will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin has experience landing its New Shepard rockets -- used for suborbital tourism -- but they are five times smaller and land on terra firma rather than a ship at sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Physically, the gleaming white New Glenn dwarfs SpaceX's 230-foot Falcon 9 and is designed for heavier payloads.
  <br>
  <br>
  It slots between Falcon 9 and its big sibling, Falcon Heavy, in terms of mass capacity but holds an edge with its wider payload fairing, capable of carrying the equivalent of 20 moving trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin has already secured a Nasa contract to launch two Mars probes aboard New Glenn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rocket will also support the deployment of Project Kuiper, a satellite Internet constellation designed to compete with Starlink.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, however, SpaceX maintains a commanding lead, while other rivals -- United Launch Alliance, Arianespace, and Rocket Lab -- trail far behind. (AFP)

    South Korea's Yoon refuses to attend questioning

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's arrested President Yoon Suk Yeol does not intend to take part in a second day of questioning on Thursday, his lawyer said, further stonewalling a criminal probe into whether he committed insurrection with his martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested, was taken to the Seoul Detention Centre on Wednesday evening after refusing to cooperate, where he was expected to have spent the night in a solitary cell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have 48 hours to question the suspended president, after which they must release him or seek a warrant to detain him for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's refusal to cooperate with investigators comes as the Constitutional Court is due to hold a second hearing in his impeachment trial to determine whether to remove him permanently or reinstate his presidential powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea is grappling with a political crisis sparked by Yoon's brief attempt to impose martial law on December 3 that was voted down by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's arrest on Wednesday ended a weeks-long standoff with authorities after police swooped before dawn on his fortified hillside villa in Seoul to the despair of followers at the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he turned himself in for questioning by corruption investigation officials to prevent what he called the risk of "unsavoury bloodshed", though he continued to protest that it was an illegal investigation and invalid arrest warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has up to now refused to talk with investigators who had prepared a questionnaire of more than 200 pages, an official from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) that is heading the criminal inquiry said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embattled leader did not even reply to a question, a CIO official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His questioning is due to resume at 2 pm local time, on Thursday, according to CIO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yoon Kab-keun, one of Yoon’s lawyers, said in a text message to reporters that Yoon would not show up for the questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap reported the same lawyer as citing Yoon's health as a factor and saying further questioning was pointless, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CIO official said he understood it was possible to forcibly bring Yoon for questioning but would make further checks on relevant laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small crowd of protesters supporting Yoon gathered and sat on a road outside the CIO office, calling the president's arrest illegitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opinion polls show a majority of South Koreans support impeaching Yoon, but the attempts to arrest him appear to have rallied his hardcore supporters. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Firefighters reported significant gains on Wednesday against the two massive wildfires burning around Los Angeles, while also extinguishing smaller blazes set by arsonists in recent days as a final round of windy, flame-fanning weather moved through Southern California.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Particularly Dangerous Situation red-flag warning expired in the afternoon, but dry conditions and gusty winds were forecast to linger into Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  So much of the nation’s second-most populous metropolitan region remained on alert for new outbreaks and flare-ups from the fires, which have killed at least 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Wednesday, gusts whipped up to 80 kph in the mountains, though many areas saw relatively light winds late in the morning, according to the National Weather Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Better conditions expected in the coming days should help fire crews make even more headway and allow residents to return to their neighbourhoods to begin rebuilding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, firefighters and police faced new challenges. Since the beginning of the wildfire outbreak last week, authorities have arrested about half a dozen people accused of setting new, small fires that were quickly knocked down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have not determined a cause for the major blazes in what is on track to become the nation’s costliest fire disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  More manageable winds on Tuesday allowed firefighters to make gains on the two most destructive fires. Almost half of the Eaton Fire just north of LA was contained, and one-fifth of the fire that destroyed much of the seaside neighbourhood of Pacific Palisades was surrounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of those broke out on January 7. (AP)

    Biden warns dangerous oligarchy taking shape in US

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden urged Americans on Wednesday to "stand guard" against threats from oligarchs, disinformation and AI in a future under Donald Trump as he delivered a dark farewell address ahead of stepping down next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden, who will be succeeded by Trump on Monday, touted his achievements in steering the US economy out of the deep crisis inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and said he had made the nation's alliances abroad stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, in his brief Oval Office speech on live television, the Democrat quickly turned to painting a series of dangers facing the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clearly referring to Trump's close ties to the world's richest man Elon Musk and other tech tycoons, Biden said an "oligarchy is taking shape in America" - and "a dangerous concentration of power."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the ultra-rich around Trump represented a concentration of "extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden recalled the stark warning issued by president Dwight Eisenhower in his own farewell address in 1961 about the dangers of an out-of-control military industrial complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech industrial complex," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And a "crumbling" media means Americans are increasingly vulnerable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power," the outgoing president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also clearly referring to Trump's plans to roll back environmental protections and withdraw from a major international global accord on combating global warming, Biden said "powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we've taken to tackle the climate crisis, to serve their own interest for power and profit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Naming another increasingly global challenge, Biden said artificial intelligence "is the most consequential technology of our time" that could bring huge benefits but also poses "risks for our economy and our security, our society." (AFP)

    UK report says patient safety is being compromised

<div class="itemFullText">
 UK patients are "coming to harm" as nurses say they are having to treat people in corridors and unsuitable places because of a "collapse in care standards", a report said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the latest indictment of Britain's beleaguered state-funded National Health Service, nine in 10 NHS nurses surveyed by the country's nurses union said "patient safety is being compromised".
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly seven in 10 said they were delivering care in "overcrowded or unsuitable places" on a "daily basis", including in corridors, converted cupboards, car parks and even bereavement rooms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The experiences of over 5,000 nursing staff across the UK highlight a devastating collapse in care standards, with patients routinely coming to harm," said the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).
  <br>
  <br>
  The report condemns the "normalisation" of so-called "corridor care", with nurses unable to access life-saving equipment in cramped spaces and patients even dying in corridors.
  <br>
  <br>
  One nurse in east England said corridor care in their hospital trust was "not an exception, it's the rule".
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, some 54,000 patients in emergency departments in England had to wait over 12 hours until a hospital bed was available, up 23 percent from December 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the RCN report testimonies are accounts of nurses treating up to 40 patients waiting in a corridor, as well as reports of pregnant women miscarrying in corridors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some reported overcrowded corridors impeding them from giving life-saving resuscitation (CPR). One nurse recalled a patient dying after a cardiac arrest "by the male toilet".
  <br>
  <br>
  Another alleged having to treat cardiac arrests "with no crash bell, crash trolley, oxygen, defibrillator... straddling a patient doing CPR while everyone watches on".
  <br>
  <br>
  There are some 7.5 million people on the NHS waiting list, with more than three million having faced delays longer than 18 weeks for treatment. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia is planning to impose interim child protection guidelines on social media companies while the government carves out a law to set a minimum age for users of the platforms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Communications minister Meutya Hafid has said the government plans to issue a regulation to set a minimum age for social media users, after discussing the proposal to protect children online with President Prabowo Subianto.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows Australia's decision to ban children under 16 from accessing social media, with fines for tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta to TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, if they fail to prevent children from accessing their platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the minister means is that the government is headed for the direction of a stronger regulation on age limit, which is through the formation of a law," said Alexander Sabar, a senior official at the communications and digital ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, he said the government will issue a regulation for digital platforms, including social media companies, to adhere to child protection guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The emphasis for the government regulation is child protection - how they are protected from physical, mental, or moral perils," he said, adding that the regulation would not totally limit children's access to social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nurmayanti, a 46-year-old mother of three, said she agreed with the plan to curtail social media content, particularly content promoting pornography or discrimination.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They now can freely open social media so that is concerning to us as parents," she said, adding the law must be strict and clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Anis Hidayah, a commissioner at Indonesia's main human rights body, said that limiting the internet for children was important but the government must be careful not to curb their right to information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 50 percent of children under 12 in tech-savvy Indonesia use the internet, with some respondents of that age group using Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, according to a survey by the Indonesia internet service providers' association. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds of Gazans chanted and embraced on Wednesday as news spread that a ceasefire and hostage release deal had been reached between Israel and Hamas aimed at ending more than 15 months of war in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a US official and a source close to the negotiations first revealed the agreement, Israel cautioned that several points "remain unresolved" that it hoped would be addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But celebrations were already underway in Gaza, where journalists saw crowds of people hugging and taking photos to mark the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't believe that this nightmare of more than a year is finally coming to an end. We have lost so many people, we've lost everything," said Randa Sameeh, a 45-year-old who was displaced from Gaza City to the Nuseirat Camp in the centre of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need a lot of rest. As soon as the truce begins, I will go to the cemetery to visit my brother and family members. We buried them in Deir el-Balah cemetery without proper graves. We will build them new graves and write their names on them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside Deir al-Balah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where so many of the war's casualties have been taken, hundreds of Palestinians gathered to chant, sing and wave flags, AFPTV footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point, a member of the crowd and a journalist in body armour were raised on people's shoulders to conduct an interview above the mass of elated Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, The "final details" of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal are still being worked on, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in the early hours of Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to US President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to thank them for helping to secure a deal for the release of hostages held in Gaza, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least 20 people were killed in Israeli strikes after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was announced on Wednesday. (AFP)

    Drake sues Universal over Kendrick diss track

<img alt="Last year the two superstar rappers exchanged a litany of increasingly vitriolic diss tracks. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787739_1_20250116055306.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Drake on Wednesday filed suit against his own label, saying Universal Music Group's release and promotion of a Kendrick Lamar track dissing him amounted to defamation and harassment.
 <br>
  <br>
  UMG, which is behind both Drake and Lamar, adamantly denied the accusations, saying "the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist -- let alone Drake -- is illogical" given the company's longtime investment in helping him "achieve historic commercial and personal financial success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year the two superstar rappers exchanged a litany of increasingly vitriolic diss tracks, with Lamar delivering the major blow with his chart-topping, Grammy-nominated song "Not Like Us."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his suit, Drake said Universal betrayed him in favor of profits by promoting the song with punchlines that accuse him of pedophilia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the documents filed in Manhattan's federal court, Drake says Universal "approved, published, and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track" that was "intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian artist born Aubrey Drake Graham, 38, says the record company chose "corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawsuit cited the track's promotion as causing a "physical threat to Drake's safety" as well as a "bombardment of online harassment."
  <br>
  <br>
  It cited a pre-dawn shooting last May that saw a gunman wound a security guard at the superstar rapper's estate in Toronto, and described subsequent break-in attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These events were not coincidental," the suit said, before detailing the defamation allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake, the reigning highest-grossing rapper, is not taking legal action against Lamar, and he is not suing over the lyrics themselves. (AFP)

    Israel and Hamas agree to Gaza ceasefire deal

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal to halt fighting in Gaza and exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, an official briefed on the deal told Reuters on Wednesday, opening the way to a possible end to a 15-month war that has upended the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agreement follows months of on-off negotiations brokered by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, with the backing of the United States, and came just ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli troops invaded Gaza after Hamas-led gunmen broke through security barriers and burst into Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 and kidnapping more than 250 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 people, mostly women and children, and left the narrow coastal enclave a wasteland of rubble, with hundreds of thousands surviving the winter cold in tents and makeshift shelters.
  <br>
  <br>
  As his inauguration approached, Trump repeated his demand that a deal be done swiftly, warning repeatedly that there would be "hell to pay" if the hostages were not released. His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff worked with President Joe Biden's team to push the deal over the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, the return of the hostages may ease some of the public anger against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Oct. 7 security failure and not securing a hostage deal until now.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conflict spread across the Middle East, with groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen attacking Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian authorities in the west of the country on Wednesday said that critical infrastructure facilities had been targeted in a "massive" Russian missile attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Critical infrastructure facilities were targeted in Prykarpattia," the regional governor of the western Ivano-Frankivsk region wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Air defence forces were working in the region," the official, Svitlana Onyshchuk, said, adding there were no casualties and that the situation was "under control."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in the western Lviv region, which borders EU and Nato member Poland, said two critical infrastructure facilities had been hit in the Drogobych and Stryi districts, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fortunately, there were no casualties, but there was damage," governor Maksym Kozytsky wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian national grid operator meanwhile announced it was introducing emergency blackouts in seven regions including the eastern Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  The apparent barrage came just one day after Ukraine said it had carried out its largest aerial attack on Russian territory, hitting factories and energy hubs hundreds of miles from the front line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Defence Ministry confirmed the attack on Tuesday, accusing Ukraine of using US- and British-made long-range missiles and drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Wednesday, the ministry said that its forces had "carried out a group strike with precision-guided weapons and attack drones against critical gas and energy infrastructure supporting the work of Ukraine's military-industrial complex." (Agencies)

    South Korea's impeached President Yoon arrested

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over insurrection accusations related to his December 3 martial law declaration, investigators said.
 <br>
  <br>
  A motorcade was seen leaving the gates of his hillside residence where Yoon has been holed up for weeks behind barbed wire barriers and a small army of personal security.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 3,000 police officers and anti-corruption investigators had gathered there before dawn, pushing through throngs of Yoon supporters and members of his ruling People Power Party who protested attempts to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers have argued attempts to detain Yoon are illegal and are designed to publicly humiliate him. The warrant investigators secured for his arrest is the first-ever issued against an incumbent South Korean president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has justified his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance against an "anti-state" opposition employing its legislative majority to thwart his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-corruption agency is leading a joint investigation with police and the military over whether Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an attempted rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law enforcement officers had sought to bring him into custody after he ignored several summons for questioning. (Agencies)

    New wildfire warnings issued as winds rise in LA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Southern Californians faced new wildfire warnings on Tuesday, and tens of thousands saw their power shut off as strong winds blew across the parched landscape around Los Angeles where two massive blazes have been burning for a week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Santa Ana winds that began gusting over the mountains before sunrise were forecast to continue until Wednesday morning with enough force to carry fire-sparking embers for miles and stoke new outbreaks in a region where at least 25 people have already been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Life threatening and destructive and widespread winds are already here,” LA city fire chief Kristin Crowley told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Southern California was under elevated fire risk, with crews on high alert from the Mexican border to Central California, far north of Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 90,000 households lost electricity as utilities shut off power to prevent their lines from sparking new blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weary and anxious residents were told to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police announced roughly 50 arrests, for looting, flying drones in fire zones, violating curfew and other crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest worry remained the threat from intense winds predicted to reach nearly hurricane force in some areas. Tuesday's forecast included a rare warning: The winds, combined with severely dry conditions, have created a “Particularly Dangerous Situation,” the National Weather service said, meaning that any new fire could explode in size.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gusts were forecast to pick up strength in the evening and into Wednesday before decreasing, and red-flag warnings from Central California to the Mexican border were to remain through most of Wednesday, weather service meteorologist Ariel Cohen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals while crews and fire engines deployed to particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials - who were criticised over their initial response - expressed confidence that the region was ready to face the new threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  With almost no rain in more than eight months, the brush-filled region has had more than a dozen wildfires this year, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just under 90,000 people in the county remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week. (AP)

    Elon Musk sued over late disclosure of Twitter stake

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the world's richest person of waiting too long to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social media company he later bought.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a complaint filed in Washington, DC federal court, the SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his initial purchase of five per cent of Twitter's common shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days, or by March 24, 2022 in Musk's case, when they cross a five per cent ownership threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk instead bought more than US$500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2 percent stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twitter's share price rose more than 27 per cent following that disclosure, the SEC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and disgorge profits he didn't deserve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk eventually purchased Twitter for US$44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that "all indications" were that his delay was a mistake. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 As the threat of a TikTok ban looms in the United States, users there are flocking to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu - making it the top downloaded app in the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the “TikTok refugees,” as they call themselves, say the TikTok alternative, a Chinese app, is being chosen in protest of the TikTok ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Supreme Court is due to rule on a law that stipulates TikTok must be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance by January 19 or face a ban in the US over national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the justices seemed inclined to let the law stand, masses of TikTok users began creating accounts on Xiaohongshu, including hashtags such as #tiktokrefugee or #tiktok to their posts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Monday, Xiaohongshu has become the top downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaohongshu, which in English means “Little Red Book”, is a Chinese social media app that combines e-commerce, short video and posting functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app has gained traction in China and other regions and countries with a Chinese diaspora, racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as make-up and skincare tutorials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The #tiktokrefugee topic has racked up over 160,000 posts on Xiaohongshu, many of which are videos of American users introducing themselves and asking for tips on how to navigate the app, which they are calling “RedNote”.
  <br>
  <br>
  An American user with the handle Definitelynotchippy made a video addressed to the Chinese users of Xiaohongshu, explaining why Americans are downloading the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they’re insisting that it’s owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,” she said. “And they’re trying to make us think that you guys are bad.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese users on Xiaohongshu have so far welcomed American users, with some offering to teach them Chinese. Others have offered tips on navigating the Chinese internet. In some cases, Chinese students have asked the Americans for help with their English homework. (AP)

    UK launches probe into dominance of Google search

<img alt="The Competition and Markets Authority will probe whether Google is using its position to prevent innovation by others in the search engine market. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787536_1_20250114213240.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's competition watchdog on Tuesday launched an investigation into Google's dominant position in the search engine market and its impact on consumers and businesses.
 <br>
  <br>
  The investigation could lead to the US tech giant being handed "strategic market status", subjecting it to special requirements under new UK regulations, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CMA will probe whether "Google is using its position to prevent innovation by others" in the search engine market and whether it gives "self-preference" to its own services.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also look into "potential exploitative conduct" including investigating the collection and use of large quantities of consumer data without informed consent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the UK's tougher new regulation that came into force this year, the watchdog has been given more powers to develop and enforce conduct requirements on companies to prevent anti-competitive behaviour in digital markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potential requirements could include Google having to make the data it collects available to other businesses or giving publishers more control over how their data is used, the CMA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar tech competition law from the European Union, the Digital Markets Act, carries hefty financial penalties for giants like Apple, Google and Meta in the event of infringements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Millions of people and businesses across the UK rely on Google's search and advertising services, with 90 percent of searches happening on their platform and more than 200,000 UK businesses advertising there," CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why it's so important to ensure these services are delivering good outcomes for people and businesses and that there is a level playing field," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google is also fighting an antitrust crackdown in the United States after the Department of Justice (DOJ) asked a federal court in November to order it to sell its widely-used Chrome browser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DOJ also asked the court to ban deals for Google to be the default search engine on smartphones and prevent it from exploiting its Android mobile operating system. (AFP)

    S Korea investigators in 'clash' arresting Yoon

<img alt="People gather inside the barricade blocking the road leading to the residence of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787563_1_20250115051133.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators seeking to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol were involved in clashes as they tried to execute a new warrant at his official residence, Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Investigators in physical clash as they attempt to forcibly enter presidential residence," the agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came as thousands of the embattled leader's die-hard supporters massed outside the presidential residence in the capital Seoul to protect Yoon, AFP reporters saw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's short-lived December 3 imposition of martial law plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators said they would detain anyone who tried to block their bid to execute a new warrant, after they arrived at the presidential residence Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two CIO vehicles have arrived in front of the (presidential) residence," Yonhap News TV reported, referring to the Corruption Investigation Office that is probing Yoon's declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the court-ordered warrant is successfully executed, Yoon would become the first sitting president in South Korean history to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a first attempt to arrest Yoon on January 3 failed after a tense hours-long standoff with his presidential guards, who refused to budge when investigators tried to execute their warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A joint team of the CIO and police have since secured a new warrant and massed as many as 1,000 personnel for Wednesday's attempt to detain Yoon, according to local media reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also threatened to detain any guards who obstruct the sitting leader's arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Personnel who appeared to be guarding the entrance from outsiders were seen walking from the residence towards its entrance gate early Wednesday, AFP reporters saw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters of Yoon were also heard chanting "illegal warrant!" while waving glow sticks and South Korean and American flags. (AFP)

    Fire-hit LA faces new peril as dangerous winds ramp up

<img alt="Los Angeles city fire chief Kristin Crowley says teams are in place ready to repel any new fires. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787545_1_20250114224256.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hot, powerful winds on Tuesday threatened to rekindle and whip up major fires that have devastated the hills and suburbs of Los Angeles, killing at least 24 people and changing the face of America's second biggest city forever.
 <br>
  <br>
  A week after blazes erupted and spread uncontained, forecasters predicted "particularly dangerous" dry Santa Ana winds would spike the wildfire threat for already exhausted firefighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stay aware of your surroundings. Be ready to evacuate. Avoid anything that can spark a fire," the National Weather Service warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  A large part of Southern California was under a Red Flag warning, indicating that intense dryness and furious winds would make conditions ripe for wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of Los Angeles County and much of neighbouring Ventura County were in a "Particularly Dangerous Situation," according to the NWS, a designation that was also declared before last week's deadly blazes erupted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials insisted they were poised, with Los Angeles city fire chief Kristin Crowley telling reporters a huge firefighting operation was well placed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have strategically pre-positioned engine strike teams and task forces which are dedicated to rapid response for any new fire that breaks out," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed danger comes with 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) of the upmarket Pacific Palisades in ruins and 14,000 acres of the city of Altadena badly charred.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90,000 evacuees are desperate to get back to their homes – or even just to see if anything at all survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My house is gone, I know that. I've seen pictures and all that's left is the chimney. But I need to see it by myself to believe it," said Fred Busche.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the desperation, there were stories of fortitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeff Ridgway told how he had refused to abandon the apartment complex he manages, defending it against the fires by hauling buckets of water from the pool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was just a war," the 67-year-old said, pointing to a eucalyptus tree he extinguished when it caught fire and threatened the building last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I was just stubborn. I was like: 'I'm not going to be defeated by you. I'm sorry, this is just not gonna happen.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  Search teams using cadaver dogs have been scouring the rubble for days, with Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna saying he expected more victims would be unearthed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every day we're doing this, we're running across the remains of individual community members," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we'll continue to find remains."
  <br>
  <br>
  With so many in dire straits, the city was clutching for any sliver of good news.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was offered by the Los Angeles Rams, who beat the Minnesota Vikings in an NFL playoff game on Monday night to take them one step closer to the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game, which had been scheduled to take place in Los Angeles, was moved to Arizona to relieve pressure on stretched law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Basketball fans also had a welcomed diversion from the fires when the Lakers played the San Antonio Spurs at home, although they lost 102-126.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers were among a dozen city sports clubs – also including the Dodgers baseball team – that have pledged US$8 million toward wildfire relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mainstay entertainment industry was also stepping up, with major studios and streamers including Netflix, Disney, Amazon, Warner and Universal parent company Comcast having all announced eight-figure donations to the recovery effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there were also many stories of individual generosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a converted parking lot in Arcadia, 600 people showed up in a single day to distribute donated supplies to evacuees, organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many had been redirected from other shelters that also could not accommodate the extra help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very different experience than any other volunteering that I typically do. Because there's really no difference between the people that are helping and the people that are being helped," said 19-year-old student Gianna Karkafi.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just, like, luck." (AFP)

<img alt='Donald Trump called special counsel Jack Smith "deranged" after his report said he would have been convicted for his alleged effort to overturn the 2020 election. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787484_1_20250114164938.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump would have been convicted for his alleged effort to overturn the 2020 election result if he hadn't been elected four years later, said a report by then special counsel Jack Smith released early on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of Justice's "view that the Constitution prohibits the continued indictment and prosecution of a President is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Office stands fully behind," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Indeed, but for Mr Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the (Special Counsel's) Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who returns to the White House on January 20, had been accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the session of Congress called to certify US President Joe Biden's election win but which was violently attacked on January 6, 2021 by a mob of the Republican's supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith, who was special counsel appointed to investigate Trump, dropped the federal criminal case against the incoming leader after he won November's presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after the report's overnight release, Trump hit back on his Truth Social platform, calling Smith "deranged", and adding he "was unable to successfully prosecute the Political Opponent of his 'boss'."
  <br>
  <br>
  "To show you how desperate Deranged Jack Smith is, he released his Fake findings at 1am in the morning," Trump added in another post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's attorneys had earlier urged US Attorney General Merrick Garland not to release the report, calling the plan to release it "unlawful, undertaken in bad faith, and contrary to the public interest."
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith's report details Trump's alleged efforts to persuade state-level Republican lawmakers and leaders to "change the results" of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Trump contacted state legislators and executives, pressured them with false claims of election fraud in their states, and urged them to take action to ignore the vote counts and change the results," according to the report released by the Department of Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significantly, he made election claims only to state legislators and executives who shared his political affiliation and were his political supporters, and only in states that he had lost," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, the report alleges Trump and co-conspirators planned to organise individuals who would have served as his electors, if he had won the popular vote, in seven states where he lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- "and cause them to sign and send to Washington false certifications claiming to be the legitimate electors."
  <br>
  <br>
  They ultimately "used the fraudulent certificates to try to obstruct the congressional certification proceeding," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The special counsel office concluded that "Trump's conduct violated several federal criminal statutes and that the admissible evidence would be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed a separate case against the former and future president last year -- over Trump's handling of top secret documents after leaving the White House -- but charges are still pending against two of his former co-defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith left the justice department last week, days after submitting his final report as special counsel. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The impeachment trial of suspended South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol began on Tuesday, with the country's Constitutional Court deciding whether to strip him of his duties over a failed martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It has started," the Constitutional Court's spokesperson told international media, adding that the first hearing -- out of a confirmed five -- ended minutes later with Yoon not in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The following sessions will take place on January 16, 21, 23 and February 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's December 3 power grab plunged South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his suspension of civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was impeached soon after and suspended from duty, but has gone to ground in his residence since, refusing summonses from investigators probing him on insurrection charges and using his presidential security team to resist arrest. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea on Tuesday test-fired multiple missiles toward its eastern waters, South Korea’s military said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the short-range ballistic missiles were fired from a northern inland area and flew about 250 kilometres before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint chiefs said the South Korean military had strengthened surveillance while sharing the launch information with the US and Japanese militaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it strongly condemns the test, describing it as a “clear provocation" that poses a serious threat to the region's peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was North Korea’s second launch event of 2025, following a ballistic launch last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea said the January 6 test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong-un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea is coming off a torrid year in weapons testing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The systems it demonstrated in 2024 included solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to strike the US mainland and various shorter-range missiles designed to overwhelm missile defences in South Korea. (AP)

<img alt="CES 2025 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787411_1_20250114100720.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Everything from autonomous snow blowers to humanoid robots filled the show floors at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Considered the World Cup of technology, the world's largest personal electronics convention wrapped up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Making their tech presence felt at the four-day event were nearly 100 registered companies from Hong Kong, more than half supported by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP).
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this year, we bring 51 companies from Hong Kong... it's actually a huge growth compared to last year. Last year we have about 18," says Derek Chim, Head of Startup Ecosystem at HKSTP.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSTP-supported companies brought in three CES Innovation Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those, Vidi Labs, demonstrated how their wearable device - with AI-driven software - could describe the surrounding environment for a visually-impaired user.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This actually proves a lot that the route that we are on is actually the right one, because a product like this not only is for Hong Kong, it's actually for the rest of the world," said Turzo Bose, co-founder & CEO of Vidi Labs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the Hong Kong Pavilion, South Korean Minji Seo - who earned her PhD in Hong Kong - displays technology that rejuvenates your eyeballs with hot yoga therapy. It's intended to help people with dry eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We create a vacuum seal, using the silicone band around the goggle, and that's the chamber that we are controlling the temperature and pressure. Our main goal to join this event was to, like, verify whether we have a market here. And we definitely verified it," said Seo, founder of Ooley Care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong exhibitor, Michael Wong - a veteran of the Hong Kong hair care industry - uses a scanner to take images of your hair and scalp, and provide an analysis and recommendation for the right shampoo, conditioner and treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We use over millions of pictures to train our AI models so that's why it's accurate, over 90 percent. So everything just can do it within three minutes. So every American has their hair growth again, said Wong, founder and CEO of HairCoSys.
  <br>
  <br>
  His showmanship helps his startup, HairCoSys, stand out among the more than 4,500 exhibitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But so do products with unique compositions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fever Chu, co-founder of Zence Object Technology, displays everything from a TV remote that integrates recycled tea leaves, to a calculator frame composed of coffee grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are using their waste and turn it into new material and give back to them. Somehow we can help them to promote their waste product, the material, to the bigger market," said Chu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says their products have drawn plenty of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last night... over 60 [emails] within two days to the potential clients."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says he has already heard back from many of them, confirming his belief that companies around the world want a greener supply chain.

    Biden says Gaza ceasefire deal 'on the brink'

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Monday that a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Hamas and Israel is "on the brink" of being finalised, amid growing optimism in Washington about negotiations in the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In the war between Israel and Hamas, we're on the brink of a proposal that I laid out in detail months ago finally coming to fruition," Biden said in a farewell speech at the State Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has been working the phones as he seeks a prized peace deal in his final days in office before Donald Trump returns to the White House on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the proposed agreement would include a surge of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the release of hostages held by Hamas and a halt to the fighting in the enclave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're working urgently to close this deal," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outgoing US president said he would be speaking soon to Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has played a key role in negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday and called the ruler of mediator Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A peace deal has seemed within reach on a number of previous occasions since the Gaza war broke out following Hamas's October 6, 2023 attack on Israel, only then to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  But optimism is growing in Washington that an agreement is possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said earlier Monday as that a truce was "close."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are close to a deal, and it can get done this week," Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not making a promise or prediction, but it is there for the taking, and we are going to work to make it happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sullivan said the "gaps have fundamentally narrowed down" between Israel and Hamas. (AFP)

 A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 has hit south-western Japan, the country's meteorological agency said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tsunami warnings were issued for Miyazaki Prefecture, where the temblor was centred, in the southwestern island of Kyushu, as well as nearby Kochi Prefecture, shortly after the quake struck at 9.19pm local time, according to the agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tsunami can strike repeatedly. Please do not enter the sea or go near coastal areas," the agency said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extent of damage was not immediately clear. (AP/AFP)

    Blue Origin pushes back launch of giant new rocket

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin will have to wait a little longer for the long-anticipated maiden orbital flight of its brand-new rocket after a launch attempt dragged on for hours before being canceled due to unspecified technical issues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The towering 98-metre rocket, dubbed New Glenn in honor of legendary astronaut John Glenn, was scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station during a three-hour window starting at 1am (0600 GMT) on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the countdown repeatedly stalled as teams scrambled to resolve anomalies, before the mission was officially "scrubbed" around 3.10am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are standing down today's launch attempt to troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue that will take us beyond our launch window," said Ariane Cornell, a Blue Origin executive, during a livestream watched by hundreds of thousands of viewers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cornell added: "We are reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the mission, dubbed NG-1, billionaire Amazon founder Bezos is taking aim at the only man in the world wealthier than him: Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its prolific Falcon 9 rockets, vital for the commercial sector, the Pentagon and Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bezos, who celebrated his 61st birthday on Sunday, watched the events unfold from the nearby launch control room.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, for his part, wished Blue Origin "Good luck!" on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town, and so having a competitor... this is great," G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior Nasa official, told AFP, expecting the competition to drive down costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX, meanwhile, is planning the next orbital test of Starship -- its gargantuan new-generation rocket -- this week, upping the high-stakes rivalry. (AFP)

    SKorea to adapt airport barriers after plane crash

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities on Monday said they would change the concrete barriers used for navigation at airports around the country after the Jeju Air crash that left 179 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 was flying from Thailand to Muan, South Korea, on December 29 carrying 181 passengers and crew when it belly-landed at Muan airport and exploded in a fireball after slamming into a concrete barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the worst-ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improvement was deemed necessary including the localiser and its foundations for a total of nine facilities across seven airports, including Muan airport," the land ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes would also apply to international airports in the cities of Jeju and Gimhae.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators are still probing the cause of the crash, which prompted a national outpouring of mourning with memorials set up across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attention has focused on several possible causes but questions have been raised about why the concrete barricade, known as a localiser and used to help planes navigate their landings, was at the end of the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The barrier at Muan airport was blamed for exacerbating the crash's severity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said it would finalise plans to adapt the localisers by the end of January, with the aim of "completing upgrades within this year".
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation was further clouded on Saturday when the transport ministry said the black boxes holding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders for the crashed flight stopped recording four minutes before the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have raided offices at Muan airport, a regional aviation office in the southwestern county, and Jeju Air's office in the capital Seoul as the probe continues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The land ministry added that Muan airport's closure period had been extended until January 19. (AFP)

    Seoul says 300 NKorean soldiers killed in Ukraine

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Around 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and 2,700 wounded while fighting for Russia, a South Korean lawmaker said Monday, citing information from Seoul's spy agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Seoul has previously claimed that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sent more than 10,000 soldiers to fight in the Ukraine conflict, in return for Russian technical assistance for Pyongyang's heavily sanctioned weapons and satellite programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv had captured two North Korean soldiers, releasing video of the injured combatants being interrogated and raising the possibility of a prisoner swap for captured Ukrainian troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deployment of North Korean troops to Russia has reportedly expanded to include the Kursk region, with estimates suggesting that casualties among North Korean forces have surpassed 3,000," lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters after a briefing from the spy agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  This includes "approximately 300 deaths and 2,700 injuries," Lee said, after a briefing from Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS).
  <br>
  <br>
  The soldiers, reportedly from North Korea's elite Storm Corps, have been ordered to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Notably, memos found on deceased soldiers indicate that the North Korean authorities pressured them to commit suicide or self-detonate before capture," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some of the soldiers had been granted "amnesty" or wanted to join North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, hoping to improve their lot by fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NIS analysis also revealed that the North Korean soldiers have "a lack of understanding of modern warfare," and are being used by Russia in a manner leading to "the high number of casualties," the lawmaker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee -- speaking for South Korea's intelligence committee in parliament -- said in the coming year, US president-elect Donald Trump, who has previously tried to woo North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, "may push for dialogue... once again".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Kim may "weigh the possibility of a visit to Russia in the first half of this year" after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on the social media platform X on Sunday, Zelensky said: "Ukraine is ready to hand over Kim Jong-un's soldiers to him if he can organise their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  There would "undoubtedly be more" North Korean soldiers captured by Kyiv, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, there may be other options available," said Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has acknowledged that North Koreans have been deployed to fight. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vast crowds of Hindu pilgrims in India began bathing in sacred waters on Monday as the Kumbh Mela festival opened, with organisers expecting 400 million people -- the largest gathering of humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The millennia-old Kumbh Mela, a show of religious piety and ritual bathing -- and a logistical challenge of staggering proportions -- is held at the site where the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the cool pre-dawn gloom, pilgrims surged forward to begin bathing in the waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great joy," said Surmila Devi, 45.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it's like bathing in nectar."
  <br>
  <br>
  Businesswoman Reena Rai's voice quivered with excitement as she spoke about the "religious reasons" that brought her to join the sprawling tents, packed along the river banks in the north Indian city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh state.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a Hindu, this is an unmissable occasion," said the 38-year-old, who travelled around 1,000 kilometres from Madhya Pradesh state to take part in the festival, which runs from Monday until February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saffron-robed monks and naked ash-smeared ascetics roamed the crowds offering blessings to devotees, many of whom had walked for weeks to reach the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The massive congregation is also an occasion for India's Hindu nationalist government to burnish its credentials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it a "divine occasion", that brings together "countless people in a sacred confluence of faith, devotion and culture".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu monk and Utter Pradesh's chief minister, welcomed devotees to "experience unity in diversity" at the "world's largest spiritual and cultural gathering".
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers say the scale of the Kumbh Mela is that of a temporary country -- with numbers expected to total around the combined populations of the United States and Canada.

  "Some 350 to 400 million devotees are going to visit the mela, so you can imagine the scale of preparations," festival spokesman Vivek Chaturvedi said.

  Hindu monks carried huge flags of their respective sects, while tractors turned into chariots for life-size idols of Hindu gods rolled by behind them accompanied by elephants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pilgrims exulted in the beat of drums and honking horns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival is rooted in Hindu mythology, a battle between deities and demons for control of a pitcher containing the nectar of immortality.

  Organising authorities are calling it the great or "Maha" Kumbh Mela. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from massive wildfires that have ravaged Los Angeles rose to 24 on Sunday, with officials warning of incoming dangerous winds that could whip the blazes up further.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fires continued to rip through the United States' second-largest city for the sixth day, reducing whole communities to scorched rubble and leaving thousands without homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Massive firefighting efforts have staunched the spread of the Palisades Fire, which was looming toward upscale Brentwood and the densely populated San Fernando Valley.
  <br>
  <br>
  But conditions are set to dramatically worsen, with "extreme fire behavior and life threatening conditions" over the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds up to 110 kilometers per hour mean a "particularly dangerous situation (PDS)" will be declared from early Tuesday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld.
  <br>
  <br>
  These gusts could fan flames and whip up embers from existing burn zones into new areas, firefighters warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles County Fire Department chief Anthony Marrone said his department had received resources including dozens of new water trucks and firefighters from far afield and was primed to face the renewed threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questioned whether hydrants could run dry again, as they did during the initial outbreak of fires last week, Mayor Karen Bass replied: "I believe the city is prepared." (AFP)

<img alt="The suspended South Korean president has been holed up in the presidential residence since his short-lived declaration of martial law. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787171_1_20250112144935.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk-yeol will not attend the first hearing of his impeachment trial next week because of safety concerns, his lawyer said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has been holed up in the presidential residence and protected by an elite guard force since being suspended and impeached last month, following a short-lived declaration of martial law that plunged the country into political chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has refused to meet prosecutors and investigators and his presidential guard unit thwarted an attempt to arrest him following a tense, hours-long standoff earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court has scheduled five trial dates spanning January 14 to February 4, which will proceed in his absence if he does not attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Concerns about safety and potential incidents have arisen. Therefore, the President will not be able to attend the trial on January 14," lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said in a statement sent to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The President is willing to appear at any time once safety issues are resolved."
  <br>
  <br>
  The court will decide whether to uphold his impeachment or restore him to office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, investigators seeking to question Yoon on insurrection charges linked to his ill-fated martial law declaration are preparing another arrest attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyers have repeatedly said an initial seven-day warrant and the new one they secured this week were both "unlawful".
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have kept secret the length of the new warrant, with local media reports saying it is longer than the previous seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rival protesters for and against Yoon have gathered almost daily in the South Korean capital since the crisis unfolded.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday more demonstrations were planned by rival camps outside Yoon's residence and on the streets of Seoul -- either calling for his impeachment to be declared invalid or for him to be detained immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's legal team say his guards remain on "high alert".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon would become the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested if investigators are able to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  If convicted, he faces prison or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A team of Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) officials and police are planning for the next attempt, which they said could be their last.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CIO said anyone obstructing their attempt could be detained themselves and police reportedly held a meeting of top commanders on Friday to plan for the renewed effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Presidential Security Service (PSS) chief Park Chong-jun -- who resigned on Friday and was automatically replaced by a more hardline Yoon loyalist -- told reporters there must be no bloodshed in any second arrest attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He faced two days of questioning and did not explain his resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am cooperating as diligently as possible with the authorities' investigation," he told reporters Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  His replacement, acting PSS chief Kim Seong-hun, refused to turn up to a third summons on Saturday claiming he had to protect Yoon, opening him up to possible arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jin-ha, head of the service's security and safety division, was questioned on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Office of Investigation, a police unit, sent a note to high-ranking police officials in Seoul requesting they prepare to mobilise 1,000 investigators for the fresh attempt, the Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the crisis goes on Yoon's ruling party has seen a bump in approval ratings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Gallup survey published Friday showed the People Power Party's approval rating had risen to 34 percent from 24 percent three weeks ago. (AFP)

    Gaza agency says eight dead in Israel strike on school

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli air strike on a school-turned-shelter on Saturday killed eight people, including two children, while the Israeli military said it targeted Hamas militants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal confirmed eight people, including two children and two women, were killed by Israeli shelling on the Halwa school in the northern Gaza city of Jabalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bassal said the strike wounded 30 people, including 19 children, and that the Halwa school housed "thousands of displaced people."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military, in a statement, acknowledged it conducted a strike on the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the air force "conducted a precise strike on terrorists in a command-and-control centre" that had previously served as the Halwa school in Jabalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it targeted the premises because "the school had been used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack was the latest in a series of Israeli strikes on school buildings housing displaced people in Gaza, where fighting has raged for more than 14 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  A strike on the United Nations-run Al-Jawni school in central Gaza on September 11 drew an international outcry after the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said six of its staff were among the 18 reported dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military accuses Hamas of hiding in school buildings where thousands of Gazans have sought shelter – a charge denied by the Palestinian militant group.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 46,537 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's military campaign in Gaza since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry. The United Nations has acknowledged these figures as reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 7 attack that triggered it resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people on the Israeli side, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity. (AFP)
