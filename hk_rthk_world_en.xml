<div class="itemFullText">
 A court in Vietnam on Tuesday upheld a death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan after rejecting her appeal against a conviction for embezzlement and bribery in a high-profile US$12 billion fraud case, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lan, the chairwoman of real estate developer Van Thinh Phat Holdings Group, was sentenced to death in April for her role in what was Vietnam's biggest financial fraud case on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High People's Court in Ho Chi Minh City determined there was no basis to reduce Lan's death sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Lan is able to return three-quarters of the money embezzled while on death row, it is possible the sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment, local media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is one of the most famous business executives and state officials jailed in the country's lengthy anti-graft campaign known as "Blazing Furnace".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The consequences Lan caused are unprecedented in the history of litigation and the amount of money embezzled is unprecedentedly large and unrecoverable," the prosecution was quoted as saying at the appeal hearing by state-run online newspaper VietnamNet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The defendant's actions have affected many aspects of society, the financial market, the economy," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media cited Lan's lawyer as saying she had many mitigating circumstances, including "having admitted guilt, showing remorse and paying back part of the amount of money embezzled", but prosecutors said that was insufficient.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan still has the right to request a review under Vietnam's retrial procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan's arrest in 2022 sparked a run on one of the country's largest private banks by deposits, Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank, which was at the centre of the fraud and largely owned by Lan through her proxies. (Reuters)

    World Court urged to recognise climate change harms

<img alt="Ralph Regenvanu speaks during UN International Court of Justice public hearings on climate change. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781806_1_20241203023030.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The future of the planet is at stake during hearings at the top United Nations court, a representative for Vanuatu said on Monday, opening a historic case that aims to set a legal framework on how countries should tackle climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 countries and organisations are set to present before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the next two weeks, the highest number ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The outcome of these proceedings will reverberate across generations, determining the fate of nations like mine and the future of our planet," said Vanuatu's representative for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This may well be the most consequential case in the history of humanity," Regenvanu told the 15-judge bench in the panelled hall of the Peace Palace in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Activists hope the ICJ opinion will have far-reaching legal consequences in the fight against climate change, impacting ongoing court cases as well as domestic and international legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others fear the UN-backed request for a non-binding advisory opinion will have limited impact - and it could take the UN's highest court months, or even years, to deliver.
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of protesters gathered outside the Peace Palace, near a big screen reading "We are watching".
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators had hung banners saying: "Biggest problem to the highest court" and "Fund our future, climate finance now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The presentations at the scenic Peace Palace come days after a bitterly negotiated climate deal at the COP29 summit in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy polluting countries ultimately agreed to find at least US$300 billion a year by 2035 to help poorer nations transition to cleaner energy sources and prepare for increasing climate impacts such as extreme weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries condemned the pledge as too little, too late, and the summit's final deal failed to include a global pledge to move away from burning planet-heating fossil fuels. (AFP)

    French PM faces no-confidence vote

<img alt="The government of Michel Barnier could be toppled as early as Wednesday. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781810_1_20241203043044.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Michel Barnier faced an abrupt end to his premiership on Monday after key opposition parties said they would back a no-confidence motion against his government after only three months in power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Certain that the National Assembly would deny him a majority backing the government's social security financing plan for next year, Barnier forced through the bill without a vote, using executive powers under article 49.3 of the French constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative premier, who formed a minority government in September after an inconclusive general election, has lived under the constant threat of a no-confidence vote that could force him to quit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government could be toppled as early as Wednesday, when a vote is expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barnier called it "a moment of truth in which everybody must take their responsibilities", warning against lawmakers putting "partisan interests" before the "best interest of the nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Far-left opposition party LFI said immediately it would bring a no-confidence motion which the far-right National Rally (RN) - the largest single party in France's parliament - said it would vote in favour of, after accusing Barnier of failing to negotiate on some of the bill's provisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key to any such vote is Marine Le Pen, the parliamentary leader of the RN that has opposed several parts of the government's 2025 budget plan, including the social security financing bill submitted to the assembly on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a last-ditch concession to the RN, Barnier's office said it was scrapping plans for a less generous prescription drug reimbursement policy from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the nod to Le Pen's concerns was not enough to avert the no-confidence motion for Barnier, who has little hope of finding any left-wing support. (AFP)

    Dozens dead in stampede at Guinea football match

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A deadly stampede at a football match killed at least 56 people in Guinea's second city N'Zerekore, the government said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The events at Sunday's match, which were initially reported as clashes between fans, were triggered after a player was sent off at the end of the game, witnesses said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match in the southeastern city was the final of a tournament organised in honour of Guinea's junta leader, Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup and has installed himself as president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition has accused the junta of using sport for political ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses said fans invaded the pitch following the referee's decision, with some attacking the stand designated for officials, prompting the intervention of security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Protests of dissatisfaction with refereeing decisions led to stone-throwing by supporters, resulting in fatal stampedes," said a government statement which was read out on national television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hospital services have put the provisional death toll at 56, with several others injured," it added, describing the incident as a "tragic event".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government assures the public that investigations will be carried out to establish who is responsible for this unfortunate event," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young people also set fire to a police station overnight, according to public television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah condemned the "incidents that marred the match between the teams of Labe and N'Zerekore", in a post on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is following the situation and reiterates its call for calm so as not to impede hospital services from aiding the injured," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported that hospital wards and a morgue were overwhelmed by the injured and dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such tournaments and other public gatherings have become common in the West African nation, in what is widely seen as a campaign to promote Doumbouya's candidacy in any future presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military seized power by force in September 2021 by overthrowing civilian President Alpha Conde.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under international pressure, the junta pledged to hand power back to a civilian government by the end of 2024 but has since made clear it will not. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An impeachment complaint was filed on Monday against Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing a legal storm over a death threat she made against the president, the alleged misuse of government funds by her office and other criminal accusations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The impeachment bid filed by several prominent opponents and activists in the House of Representatives accuses Duterte of violating the country’s Constitution, massive corruption and other “high crimes,” including the death threats she made against the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president's legal troubles have unfolded in the backdrop of her increasingly bitter political feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in online news conference on November 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Speaker Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned was not a joke.
  <br>
  <br>
  She later said she was not threatening him but was expressing concern for her own safety. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Georgia fired tear gas and water cannon on Sunday on a fourth straight day of pro-EU protests that drew tens of thousands of people, as the prime minister rebuffed calls for new elections.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party claimed victory in October 26 parliamentary polls that the pro-European opposition said were fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turmoil has deepened since Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced on Thursday that Georgia was shelving accession talks with the European Union until 2028, sparking a wave of protests in the capital, Tbilisi, and other cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition is boycotting the new parliament, while pro-EU President Salome Zurabishvili has asked the constitutional court to annul the election result, declaring the new legislature and government "illegitimate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics accuse Georgian Dream, in power for more than a decade, of having steered the country away from the EU in recent years, an accusation it denies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry has said about 150 demonstrators have been arrested in this latest protest wave, while the Georgian Young Lawyers' Association put the number at 200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in some instances have chased protesters through the streets, beating them and firing rubber bullets and tear gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Waving European and Georgian flags, tens of thousands rallied outside parliament on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some demonstrators tossed fireworks and stones at riot police, while others banged on the metal door blocking parliament's entrance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later fired water cannon, but were unable to disperse the crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late at night, riot police in full gear moved in, using tear gas and water cannon to disperse the rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the opposition United National Movement party, Levan Khabeishvili, told journalists that he was attacked by around 15 masked police officers attempting to detain him, but said he had managed to escape with the help of protesters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another protest took place outside the offices of Georgia's Public Broadcaster, widely accused of acting as a propaganda tool for the ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broadcaster conceded to the protesters' demand to grant Zurabishvili airtime, which it had previously denied her.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simultaneous protests took place in cities across Georgia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fuelling popular anger, Kobakhidze ruled out new parliamentary elections, saying that "the formation of the new government based on the October 26 parliamentary elections has been completed".
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this week, the party nominated far-right former football international Mikheil Kavelashvili for the largely ceremonial post of president.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zurabishvili told AFP in an exclusive interview on Saturday that she would not step down until last month's contested parliamentary elections are re-run.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels has not recognised the outcome of the October elections, and demanded an investigation into "serious electoral irregularities".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Parliament has called for a re-run and for sanctions against top Georgian officials, including Kobakhidze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zurabishvili on Saturday said that she was "the only legitimate institution in the country", and that "as long as there are no new elections... my mandate continues".
  <br>
  <br>
  Constitutional law experts have questioned the legitimacy of the new parliament, citing the fact it approved its own credentials in violation of a requirement to await a court ruling on Zurabishvili's bid to annul the election results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of public servants, including from the ministries of foreign affairs, defence and education, as well as a number of judges, issued joint statements protesting Kobakhidze's decision to postpone EU accession talks. (AFP)

    Left-wing looks set for gains in Romanian election

<div class="itemFullText">
 Romania's ruling leftist Social Democrats (PSD) looked set to win the most votes in a parliamentary election on Sunday, fending off a resurgent far-right movement that challenged the country's pro-Western orientation, partial results showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vote is the second of three consecutive ballots for both a new parliament and a new president, after the first round of the presidential election on November 24 saw an independent far-right candidate, Calin Georgescu, emerge from relative obscurity to become the frontrunner.
  <br>
  <br>
  His unexpected win ushered in support for ultra-nationalist, hard-right parties, some with overt pro-Russian sympathies, which political analysts said could undermine Romania's support for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  If final results confirm the preliminary count, a pro-Western coalition led by the PSD would likely have enough seats in parliament to form a government, although the far right would be a substantial force in the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a broad coalition would be difficult to form amid disagreements over reforms and measures needed to rein in the country's gaping budget deficit, now the highest in the EU at eight percent of economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a campaign dominated by voters' concerns over budget problems and the cost of living, the election pitted the far-right contenders against pro-European mainstream parties that have angered their voters with infighting and corruption allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Far-right parties have also used Romania's championing of Ukraine to stoke fears the war could spill over the border unless the country halts its support, as well as resentment over alleged preferential treatment for refugees from Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romania has the EU's biggest share of the population at risk of poverty, and swathes of the country need investment to attract jobs. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 25 people were killed in northwestern Syria in air strikes carried out by the Syrian government and Russia, the Syrian opposition-run rescue service known as the White Helmets said early on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russian and Syrian jets struck the rebel-held city of Idlib in northern Syria on Sunday, military sources said, as President Bashar al-Assad vowed to crush insurgents who had swept into the city of Aleppo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army also said it had recaptured several towns that rebels had overrun in recent days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Insurgents led by jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched a two-pronged attack on Aleppo and the countryside around Idlib last Wednesday, before moving toward neighbouring Hama province.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, government troops created a “strong defensive line” in northern Hama, as they attempted to stall the insurgents’ momentum, according to Britain-based opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent, destabilising front reopening in the Middle East at a time when Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, conflicts that have repeatedly threatened to ignite an even wider regional war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also risks drawing Russia and Turkey — each with its own interests to protect in Syria — into direct heavy fighting against each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The insurgents announced their offensive last Wednesday, just as a ceasefire started between Hezbollah and Israel that raised some hope tensions in the region might be calming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The surprise offensive is an embarrassment for Assad, and it comes at a time when his allies — Iran and groups it backs and Russia — are preoccupied with their own conflicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement from Assad’s office, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reassured the Syrian leader during a visit to Damascus that Tehran was ready to support the government in their counter-offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab leaders, including Jordan’s King Abdullah II and United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, have also called Assad to express their solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions, has ground on since 2011 with no formal end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the heavy fighting stopped years ago after Iran-backed militias and Russian air power helped Assad win control of all major cities. (Agencies)

    Biden pardons son over 'miscarriage of justice'

<img alt="Hunter Biden was convicted earlier this year of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun, and pleaded guilty in a separate tax evasion trial.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Biden on Sunday issued an official pardon for his son Hunter, who is facing sentencing for two criminal cases related to tax evasion and the purchase of a firearm.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son -- and that is wrong," the president said in a statement, calling it "a miscarriage of justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The younger Biden was convicted earlier this year of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun -- a felony -- and has also pleaded guilty in a separate tax evasion trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pardon comes after Biden has repeatedly said he wouldn't intervene in his son's legal troubles. The White House press secretary said as recently as September that Biden wouldn't issue a pardon for Hunter.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, criminal cases against President-elect Donald Trump have come to a standstill after a sweeping ruling on presidential immunity by the Supreme Court -- all but ensuring Biden's Republican rival will likely never see a jail cell, even after his landmark conviction for falsifying business records in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted," Biden said in Sunday's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice." (AFP)

    Kuwait ruler urges immediate Gaza ceasefire

<img alt="Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah (left0 also called on the international community to provide protection for innocent civilians. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781644_1_20241201212541.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kuwait's ruler on Sunday urged an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as he addressed a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council held after nearly 14 months of war in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah called on the international community to implement "an immediate ceasefire, providing international protection for innocent civilians and ensuring the opening of safe corridors and the arrival of urgent humanitarian aid".
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting of the six-member GCC comes at a time of acute and ongoing uncertainty for the Middle East following Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel and a subsequent war on Gaza, which has repeatedly threatened spillover into a wider regional conflagration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheikh Meshal hit out at what he characterised as the "double standards in the application of relevant international laws, charters and resolutions" which he said had undermined "the region's security and stability".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Kuwait was "optimistic" about a ceasefire agreed between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that he said would contribute "to reducing escalation in the region".
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar and other countries also welcomed last week's a truce after a year of conflict that killed thousands in Lebanon and caused mass displacement on both sides of the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting escalated in September after continuous cross-border strikes, initiated by Iran-backed Hezbollah in support of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kuwaiti ruler spoke in support of Saudi's work to form a global body pushing for an independent Palestinian state and lauded "positive and constructive" work by Iran and the GCC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia had appeared close to a normalisation deal with Israel prior to October 2023 but Riyadh indicated it was unwilling to move ahead while Israel pursued its campaign in Gaza, hardening its position in recent months saying it would not recognise Israel without an independent Palestinian state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anxious about being drawn into tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and nearby Iran, also precipitated by fighting in Gaza, the wealthy and traditionally western-allied Gulf monarchies have sought to cultivate improved relations with Tehran.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli air raid on Iran in October was the most recent in a series of retaliatory attacks between the two countries. (AFP)

    Centre-right parties to retain power in Ireland

<img alt="Irish police officers stand by as ballot papers are counted in Dublin. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781636_1_20241201195656.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The incumbent centre-right parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael looked set to retain power in Ireland as vote counting in the European Union member's general election resumed on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With around 45 seats of the new 174-seat lower chamber of parliament decided, the parties were ahead of the main opposition party, the left-wing nationalist Sinn Fein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media projected Fianna Fail, led by the experienced Micheal Martin, 64, would win the largest vote share and over 40 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fine Gael, whose leader Simon Harris, 38, is the outgoing prime minister (taoiseach), were in second place according to projections, with Sinn Fein in third.
  <br>
  <br>
  To form a majority, a party or coalition requires at least 88 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both centre-right parties have repeatedly ruled out entering a coalition with Sinn Fein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left opposition Labour party is seen by Fine Gael and Fianna Fail as the most likely junior coalition party, according to local media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Green Party was the third member of the previous coalition but its support collapsed nationwide, with all but one seat likely to be lost.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the last general election in 2020, the pro-Irish unity Sinn Fein -- the former political wing of the paramilitary Irish Republican Army -- was the most popular party but could not find willing coalition partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  That led to weeks of horse-trading, ending up with Fine Gael, which has been in power since 2011, agreeing a deal with Fianna Fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the last parliamentary term, the role of prime minister rotated between the Fianna Fail and Fine Gael leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final seat numbers, which will not be confirmed until early next week, will determine whether Harris returns as taoiseach or Martin takes the role under a rotation arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new parliament is due to sit for the first time on December 18, but following coalition talks a new government is not expected to be formed until the new year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-week campaign, launched after Harris called a snap election on November 8, was dominated by rancour over housing supply and cost-of-living crises, health, public spending, and the economy. (AFP)

    EU foreign policy chief warns Georgian authorities

<img alt="Kaja Kallas, who took office on Sunday with a visit to Ukraine, said " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781619_1_20241201173234.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's new foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Sunday warned Georgian authorities over violence against demonstrators protesting the government's decision to shelve its bid to join the bloc.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear that using violence against peaceful protesters is not acceptable, and the Georgian government should respect the will of the Georgian people," Kallas told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When it comes to European Union, then this clearly has consequences on our relationship with Georgia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kallas, who took office on Sunday with a visit to Ukraine, said "options" had been put forward to the EU's 27 member states on how to respond, including potentially imposing sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have different options. But of course, we need to come to agreement," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violent clashes erupted on Saturday outside Georgia's parliament between police and demonstrators protesting the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis, AFP reporters witnessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people gathered in Georgia's capital Tbilisi on Saturday for a third night of protests that saw dozens arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-European opposition said was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chaotic scenes unfolded for hours as police chased defiant protesters through the streets of central Tbilisi, beating them and making arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masked officers in riot gear fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons as they moved in to disperse protesters hurling fireworks, while flames were seen coming from a window of the parliament building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators erected barricades on Tbilisi's main avenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said "the actions of some individuals present at the protest became violent" and that police would "respond appropriately and in accordance with the law to every violation".
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have been arrested in the last two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's announcement on Thursday that Georgia would not seek accession talks with the EU until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition. (AFP)

    'Obstruction' blocking pact on plastic pollution

<img alt="Environmentalists have demanded stronger commitments to fight plastic waste at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee in Busan. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781577_1_20241201094724.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France on Sunday accused a handful of countries of obstructing negotiations in South Korea to reach the world's first treaty to curb plastic pollution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also are worried by the continuing obstruction by the so-called like-minded countries," Olga Givernet, France's minister delegate for energy, told reporters, referring to a group of mostly oil-producing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 200 countries are in the port city of Busan for negotiations on a deal to curb plastic pollution, with only a few hours left on the clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Finding an agreement for us on (an) ambitious treaty that reduces plastic pollution remains an absolute priority for France," Givernet said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning on pushing it, pushing it again."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of plastic is not recycled, while plastic production is expected to triple by 2060.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to reach the landmark agreement have been locked over several key sticking points, particularly reducing production and phasing out chemicals believed or known to harm human health.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 countries back those measures and insist a treaty without them will fail to solve the pollution crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  But around a dozen nations -- mostly producers of plastic precursors derived from fossil fuels -- are strongly opposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still have a few hours left in these negotiations, there is time to find common ground, but Rwanda cannot accept a toothless treaty," said Juliet Kabera, director general of the Rwanda Environment Management Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest draft text remains full of opposing views and contradictory language, and a promised new version after long hours of negotiations into Saturday night has not yet been published.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to fight for an ambitious outcome in Busan," Givernet said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have still a few hours to discuss and make contributions and be certain that our determination (is) to carry on with the negotiation process until the last hour." (AFP)

    Gaza rescuers say 3 aid workers die in Israeli strike

<img alt="The car carrying the aid workers was almost completely destroyed by the strike in Khan Younis. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781558_1_20241130221340.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said three aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike in the Hamas-run territory on Saturday but the Israeli army said it killed a "terrorist."
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency said the aid workers killed were Palestinian employees of World Central Kitchen (WCK). The US aid group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army said it had "struck a vehicle with a terrorist that took part in the murderous October 7 massacre," referring to the militant group Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The claim that the terrorist was simultaneously a WCK worker is being examined," it added in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the bodies of "at least five dead were transported (to hospital), including (those of) the three employees of World Central Kitchen."
  <br>
  <br>
  "All three men worked for WCK and they were hit while driving in a WCK jeep in Khan Younis," Bassal said, adding that the vehicle had been "marked with its logo clearly visible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army insisted its strike in the main southern city hit "a civilian unmarked vehicle and its movement on the route was not coordinated for transporting of aid."
  <br>
  <br>
  In April, an Israeli air strike killed seven WCK staff – an Australian, three Britons, a North American, a Palestinian and a Pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said it had been targeting a "Hamas gunman" in that strike but the military admitted a series of "grave mistakes" and violations of its own rules of engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,207 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed 44,382 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kosovo stepped up security measures around "critical" infrastructure on Saturday after an explosion at a key canal feeding two of its main power plants, as neighbouring Serbia rejected accusations it had staged the blast.
 <br>
  <br>
  The explosion occurred on Friday near the town of Zubin Potok in a Serb-dominated area in Kosovo's troubled north, damaging the canal supplying water to cooling systems at two coal-fired power plants that generate most of Kosovo's electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Albin Kurti called a security meeting late on Friday, saying: "This is a criminal and terrorist attack aimed at damaging our critical infrastructure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The attack was carried out by professionals. We believe it comes from gangs directed by Serbia," he added without providing any evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government later issued a statement echoing his allegations, saying that "initial indications suggest" the explosion had been "orchestrated by the Serbian state, which has the capacity to carry out such a criminal and terrorist attack."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kosovo also "approved additional measures to strengthen security around essential infrastructure and services, such as bridges, transformers" and other sites, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serbia slapped back on Saturday, condemning the attack, while calling the accusation "premature" and "baseless."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such destructive actions are unacceptable and threaten the fragile stability we are striving to maintain," Serbian Foreign Minister Marko Djuric said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Serbia unequivocally demands responsibility for the perpetrators of this reckless attack," he added, while suggesting the Kosovar "regime" could be behind the blast and calling for an internationally-led investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main political party representing Serbs in Kosovo, Serb List, also condemned the attack "in the strongest possible terms."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pictures from the scene published by local media showed water leaking heavily from one side of the reinforced canal, which runs from the Serb-majority north of Kosovo to the capital Pristina and also supplies drinking water.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, electricity supplies to consumers were running smoothly on Saturday morning, with authorities having found an alternative method for cooling the plants, Kosovo's Economy Minister Artane Rizvanolli said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Repair work was ongoing, authorities said. (AFP)

    Greenpeace activists board tanker in plastic protest

<img alt="The environmental group say they boarded the vessel to put pressure on plastic treaty negotiators before talks are due to end on Sunday. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781548_1_20241130190810.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenpeace activists boarded a tanker off South Korea on Saturday in an action intended to draw attention to calls for a treaty to curb plastic pollution, the environmental group said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 200 countries are in Busan to negotiate the deal, but there is little sign of agreement with just a day left before talks are due to end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greenpeace said the tanker Buena Alba, anchored off the Hanwha TotalEnergies complex, was scheduled to pick up propylene, which is used to manufacture plastic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The activists boarded the vessel peacefully and met no reaction from the vessel crew," said Greenpeace spokeswoman Angelica Pago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We painted 'PLASTIC KILLS' on the side of the vessel and the climbers successfully set up a camp," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They intend to stay in order to continue putting pressure on the negotiators to resist fossil fuel and petrochemical industry interference in the talks and to deliver a treaty that firmly cuts plastic production."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for South Korea's coast guard said police had been "deployed on the ship, and we are making warning announcements to facilitate a safe disembarkation."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a "thorough investigation" would be carried out to determine if there were any "illegal elements" to the protest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attempts to reach an agreement on curbing plastic pollution have stalled over several key sticking points, including whether to cut new plastic production.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of countries, backed by environmental groups, insist a treaty without production cuts will fail to solve the problem, but a group of largely oil-producing states is fiercely opposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The brave activists that boarded that vessel today show the courage and should inspire governments here to hold the line and do what everyone knows is obvious," Greenpeace delegation head Graham Forbes told reporters in Busan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The negotiations have reached a "pivotal moment," he said, but "a handful of governments... are looking backwards and refusing to take the steps necessary for us all to advance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we are at a very risky moment right now of being sold out, and that would be an absolute catastrophe," Forbes said. (AFP)

    Georgia arrests 107 people as pro-EU protests continue

<img alt="Riot police fired water cannons and tear gas at pro-EU protesters gathered outside the parliament in Tbilisi, who threw eggs and fireworks. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781547_1_20241130184626.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia on Saturday said 107 people were arrested during a second day of protests sparked by the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-EU opposition said was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said 107 people were detained for "disobedience to lawful police orders and petty hooliganism."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Throughout the night... protesters threw various objects, including stones, pyrotechnics, glass bottles, and metal items, at law enforcement officers," it said, adding that "10 employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were injured."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry had said that 32 police officers were wounded and 43 protestors detained on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's statement on Thursday that Georgia will not seek to open accession talks with the European Union until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition and two days of protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later accused the opposition and the EU ambassador to Georgia of distorting his words, and insisted membership in the bloc "by 2030" remains his "top priority."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, riot police fired water cannons and tear gas at pro-EU protesters gathered outside the parliament in Tbilisi, who tossed eggs and fireworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clashes broke out later between protesters and police, who moved in to clear the area outside parliament, beating demonstrators, some of whom threw objects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Independent TV station Pirveli said one of its journalists was hospitalised with serious injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests were also held in other cities across Georgia on Friday, independent TV station Mtavari reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pro-Western opposition parties are boycotting the new parliament, while President Salome Zurabishvili has sought to annul the election results through the country's constitutional court.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address to the nation on Friday evening, the pro-Western president – at loggerheads with the ruling party – said: "The resistance movement has begun... I stand in solidarity with it."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will remain united until Georgia achieves its goals: to return to its European path, secure new elections."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the October vote, a group of Georgia's leading election monitors said they had evidence of a complex scheme of large-scale electoral fraud. (AFP)

    13 more killed in Pakistan sectarian fighting

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sectarian feuding in northwest Pakistan killed 13 more people, a local government official said on Saturday, as warring Sunnis and Shi'ites defied repeated ceasefire orders, bringing the total death toll in a recent spasm of violence to 124.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country, but Kurram district – in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the border with Afghanistan – has a large Shi'ite population and the communities have clashed for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh fighting broke out last Thursday when two separate convoys of Shi'ite Muslims travelling under police escort were ambushed, killing more than 40.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then 10 days of fighting with light and heavy weapons has brought the region to a standstill, with major roads closed and mobile phone services cut as the death toll surged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Kurram local government official put the death toll at 124 on Saturday after 13 more people were killed in the past two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two were Sunni and 11 Shi'ite, he said, whilst more than 50 people have been wounded in fresh fighting which continued on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a severe lack of trust between the two sides, and neither tribe is willing to comply with government orders to cease hostilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police report that many people want to flee the area due to the violence, but the deteriorating security situation makes it impossible," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A seven-day ceasefire deal was announced by the provincial government last weekend but failed to hold. Another 10-day truce was brokered on Wednesday but it also failed to stymie the fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior security official in the provincial capital of Peshawar, also speaking anonymously, confirmed the total death toll of 124.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a fear of more fatalities," he said. "None of the provincial government's initiated measures have been fully implemented to restore peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have regularly struggled to control violence in Kurram, which was part of the semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas until it was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 79 people had been killed in the region between July and October in sectarian clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The feuding is generally rekindled by disputes over land in the rugged mountainous region, and fuelled by underlying tensions between the communities adhering to different sects of Islam. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 122,000 people have been forced out of their homes as massive floods caused by relentless rains swept through Malaysia's northern states, disaster officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number surpassed the 118,000 displaced during one of the country's worst floodings in 2014, and disaster officials feared it could rise further as there was no let-up in the torrential downpours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll remained at four recorded across Kelantan, Terengganu and Sarawak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kelantan state bore the brunt of the flooding, accounting for 63 percent of the 122,631 people displaced, according to data from the National Disaster Management Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were nearly 35,000 people evacuated in Terengganu, with the rest of the displacements reported from seven other states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy rains, which began early this week, continued to hammer Pasir Puteh town in Kelantan, where people could be seen walking through streets inundated with hip-deep waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My area has been flooded since Wednesday. The water has already reached my house corridor and is just two inches away from coming inside," said Pasir Puteh resident and school janitor Zamrah Majid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Luckily, I moved my two cars to higher ground before the water level rose."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she allowed her grandchildren to play in the water in front of her house because it was still shallow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if the water gets higher, it would be dangerous, I'm afraid they might get swept away," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't received any assistance yet, whether it's welfare or other kinds of help."
  <br>
  <br>
  Muhammad Zulkarnain, 27, who is living with his parents in Pasir Puteh, said they were isolated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no way in or out of for any vehicles to enter my neighbourhood," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I'm scared... Luckily we have received some assistance from NGOs, they gave us food supplies like biscuits, instant noodles, and eggs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of emergency services personnel have been deployed in flood-prone states along with rescue boats, four-wheel-drive vehicles and helicopters, said Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who chairs the National Disaster Management Committee. (AFP)

    Syria war monitor says rebels control 'most of' Aleppo

<div class="itemFullText">
 A monitor of Syria's war said on Saturday that jihadist rebels now control a majority of Aleppo city, reporting Russian air strikes on parts of Syria's second city for the first time since 2016.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions... took control of most of the city and government centres and prisons," said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, referring to a jihadist alliance led by Al-Qaeda's former Syria branch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrian jihadist rebels have pressed a lightning offensive against forces of the Iranian- and Russian-backed Syrian government since Wednesday, the same day a fragile ceasefire took effect in neighbouring Lebanon between Israel and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah after two months of all-out war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, Russian "warplanes launched raids on areas of Aleppo city for the first time since 2016," added the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  It raised the death toll in days of clashes to 311 – 183 from HTS and allied Turkish-backed factions, 100 soldiers and pro-government forces, as well as 28 civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media reported that four civilians were killed when HTS shelled a student residence in Aleppo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran-backed militias have a heavy presence in the Aleppo region after providing crucial ground support when the Syrian army – backed by Russian air power – recaptured rebel-held areas of the city in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said that "the governor of Aleppo and the police and security branch commanders withdrew from the city centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  The overnight air strikes coincided with "the arrival of large (rebel) military reinforcements" to the area, the Observatory added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Flooding driven by heavy rains in southern Thailand has killed nine people and displaced more than 13,000, officials said on Saturday, as rescue teams using boats and jet skis worked to reach stranded residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Local media footage showed residents wading through murky, chest-deep water and cars submerged in flooded streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Flooding across eight provinces in southern Thailand has affected 553,921 households and claimed nine lives, prompting agencies to mobilise urgent assistance," the country's disaster agency said on its official Facebook page.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 13,000 people had been forced to flee their homes, with temporary shelters set up in schools and temples, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nampa, a resident of coastal Songkhla province, told state broadcaster Thai PBS she was concerned about the dwindling food supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are doing fine now, but I am not sure how long can we stay in this condition," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two hospitals in nearby Pattani province suspended operations to prevent floodwaters from damaging medical facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring north Malaysia, the rains have forced the evacuation of at least 80,000 people to temporary shelters this week, with disaster officials there saying at least four people have been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai Meteorological Department has warned that "very heavy rain" could continue to affect some areas of the country's south through next week.

  The government has deployed rescue teams to assist affected residents and designated 50 million baht (US$1.7 million) in flood relief for each province.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on Friday on social media platform X that the goal was to "restore normalcy as quickly as possible."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK lawmakers voted on Friday in favour of assisted dying for terminally ill people in England and Wales, advancing the emotive and contentious legislation to the next stage of parliamentary scrutiny.
 <br>
  <br>
  MPs voted by 330 to 275 in support of legalised euthanasia in the first vote on the issue in the House of Commons for nearly a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result came following an emotionally-charged debate that lasted almost five hours in a packed and hushed chamber, and as competing protesters made their voices heard outside parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill now progresses to the committee stage where lawmakers can table amendments, a process likely to be vexed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legislation would then face further votes in the Commons and House of Lords upper chamber. The process will likely take months and if it is ultimately passed then a change in the law is expected to be several years away.
  <br>
  <br>
  The House of Commons last debated, and defeated, a euthanasia bill in 2015, but public support for giving terminally ill people the choice to end their lives has since shifted in favour, polls show.
  <br>
  <br>
  A change in the law would see Britain emulate several other countries in Europe and elsewhere that allow some form of assisted dying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who is behind the bill, told the debate that changing the law would give terminally ill people "choice, autonomy and dignity at the end of their lives."
  <br>
  <br>
  Advocates also argue that it would make some deaths less painful.
  <br>
  <br>
  But other MPs expressed concern that people might feel coerced into opting for euthanasia, while some said they were worried it would discriminate against people with disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opponents also worry that the healthcare system is not ready for such a landmark change and that it could cause a decline in investment for palliative care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "True dignity consists in being cared for to the end," Conservative MP Danny Kruger said, urging colleagues to reject a "state suicide service."
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside, dozens of opponents gathered holding signs with "Kill the Bill, not the ill" and "Care not killing," urging MPs to vote against the proposed legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A nearby gathering in favour of the legislation saw people dressed in pink holding placards with slogans such as: "My life, my death, my choice."
  <br>
  <br>
  Assisted suicide currently carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Scotland, which has a separate legal system and devolved powers to set its own health policy, it is not a specific criminal offence. But it can leave a person open to other charges, including murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leadbeater's bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults with an incurable illness who have a life expectancy of fewer than six months and are able to take the substance that causes their death themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any patient's wish to die would have to be signed off by a judge and two doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures are stricter than assisted dying laws in other European countries and also proposed legislation being contemplated in France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consideration is being given to a similar bill in Scotland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leadbeater's initiative is a so-called private members' bill and is not part of the government's agenda, although it follows Prime Minister Keir Starmer's vow, before winning power in July, to allow parliament to revisit the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  MPs had a free vote, meaning predicting the outcome was virtually impossible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer, who voted in favour of permitting assisted suicide in 2015 with "robust" safeguards, did not reveal his view in the run-up to the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  His ministerial team had been instructed to remain neutral but several expressed views, both in support and against.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two polls last week indicated that a majority of Britons back changing the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faith leaders are among the stringent opponents, with nearly 30 signing a joint letter last weekend arguing they are "deeply concerned" by the plans. (AFP)

    Notre Dame unveils its new interior 5 years after fire

<img alt="President Macron and his wife Brigitte admire the stunning renovation. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781464_1_20241129212106.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than five years of frenetic reconstruction work, Notre Dame Cathedral showed its new self to the world on Friday, with rebuilt soaring ceilings and creamy good-as-new stonework erasing sombre memories of its devastating fire in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Images broadcast live of a site visit by French President Emmanuel Macron showed the inside of the iconic cathedral as worshippers might have experienced it back in medieval times, its wide, open spaces filled with bright light on a crisp and sunny winter’s day that lit up the vibrant colours of the stained glass windows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside, the monument is still a construction site, with scaffolding and cranes. But the renovated interior – shown in its full glory on Friday for the first time before the public is allowed back in on December 8 – proved to be breathtaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gone are the gaping holes that the blaze tore into the vaulted ceilings, leaving charred piles of debris. New stonework has been carefully pieced together to repair and fill the wounds that had left the cathedral's insides exposed to the elements. Delicate golden angels look on from the centrepiece of one of the rebuilt ceilings, seeming to fly again above the transept.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cathedral's bright, cream-coloured limestone walls look brand new, cleaned not only of dust from the fire but also of grime that had accumulated for centuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cathedral attracted millions of worshippers and visitors annually before the April 15, 2019, fire forced its closure and turned the monument in the heart of Paris into a no-go zone except for artisans, architects and others mobilised for the reconstruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron entered via the cathedral’s giant and intricately carved front doors and stared up at the ceilings in wonder. He was accompanied by his wife, Brigitte, the archbishop of Paris and others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powerful vacuum cleaners were used to first remove toxic dust released when the fire melted the cathedral's lead roofs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fine layers of latex were then sprayed onto the surfaces and removed a few days later, taking dirt away with them from the stones' pores, nooks and crevices. In all, 42,000 square metres of stonework were cleaned and decontaminated – an area equivalent to roughly six soccer pitches.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It feels like it was built yesterday, like it’s just been born, even though Notre Dame is very old," said stonemason Adrien Willeme, who worked on the reconstruction. "Because it’s been so carefully restored and cleaned, it looks really extraordinary.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleaning gels were also used on some walls that had been painted, removing many years of accumulated dirt and revealing their bright colours once again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carpenters worked by hand like their medieval counterparts as they hewed giant oak beams to rebuild the roof and spire that collapsed like a flaming spear into the inferno. The beams show the marks of the carpenters' handiwork, with dents made on the woodwork by their hand axes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 2,000 oak trees were felled to rebuild roof frameworks so dense and intricate that they are nicknamed “the forest.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron's visit kicked off a series of events ushering in the reopening of the 12th-century Gothic masterpiece. At the end of his tour, the president addressed hundreds of workers gathered inside the cathedral and thanked them for their labours on what he called the "building site of the century.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The shock of the reopening will, I want to believe, be as powerful as the one of the fire. But it will be a shock of hope,” he said. “The inferno of Notre Dame was a wound for the nation. And you were its remedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron will return on December 7 to deliver another address and will attend the consecration of the new altar during a solemn Mass the following day. (AP)

    Crypto boss eats banana 'art' he bought for US$6.2mn

<img alt="Justin Sun compared conceptual art like the banana to NFT art and decentralised blockchain technology, before scoffing it. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781457_1_20241129201802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun on Friday fulfilled a promise he made after spending US$6.2 million on an artwork featuring a banana duct-taped to a wall – by eating the fruit.
 <br>
  <br>
  At one of Hong Kong's priciest hotels, Sun chomped down on a banana in front of dozens of journalists and influencers after giving a speech hailing the work as "iconic" and drew parallels between conceptual art and cryptocurrency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's much better than other bananas," Sun said after getting his first taste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really quite good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Titled "Comedian," the conceptual work created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan was sold at a Sotheby's auction in New York last week, with Sun among seven bidders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said he felt "disbelief" in the first 10 seconds after he won the bid, before realising "this could become something big."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 10 seconds after that, he decided he would eat the banana.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Eating it at a press conference can also become a part of the artwork's history," he said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The debut of the edible creation at the 2019 Art Basel show in Miami Beach sparked controversy and raised questions about whether it should be considered art – Cattelan's stated aim.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Sun on Friday compared conceptual art like "Comedian" to NFT art and decentralised blockchain technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of its objects and ideas exist as (intellectual property) and on the internet, as opposed to something physical," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also this week disclosed a US$30 million investment in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project backed by US president-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crypto businessman was last year charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission with offering and selling unregistered securities in relation to his crypto project Tron. The case is ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a function room at the Peninsula hotel in Hong Kong, two men dressed as auction house staff stood in front of a featureless wall with the yellow banana offering the only splash of colour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said he only recently decided to bid for the artwork, adding he had "dumb questions" such as whether the banana had decayed and how to value the work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The artwork owner is given a certificate of authenticity that the work was created by Cattelan as well as instructions about how to replace the fruit when it goes bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event attendees on Friday each received a roll of duct tape and a banana as a souvenir.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone has a banana to eat," he said. (AFP)

    Mexico rules out trade war with US

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump has said the tariffs would remain in effect until the flow of drugs and migrants into the US was controlled.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Thursday ruled out a trade war with the United States after speaking with President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened stiff tariffs to halt illegal immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There will not be a potential tariff war," Sheinbaum - who has been scrambling to head off threatened tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican goods - told a daily news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was speaking a day after a telephone call with Trump, who has threatened to slap tariffs on Canada and China in addition to Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their call, Sheinbaum and Trump offered differing accounts of what they had discussed regarding migration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump claimed that Mexico's left-wing president had "agreed to stop migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum later said she had discussed a policy already in place, and denied Trump's version again on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can assure you... that we would never - we would not be capable - of proposing that we were going to close the border," she said, adding: "Of course we do not agree with that."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she had assured the Republican leader that a caravan of migrants assembled in southern Mexico, over which Trump had expressed concern, "will not reach the northern border," pointing to Mexico's "strategy" of preventing such convoys crossing its territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that after that, the talks had no longer revolved around the threat of tariff hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump caused panic among some of the biggest US trading partners on Monday when he said he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican and Canadian imports and 10 percent on goods from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard warned on Wednesday that some 400,000 jobs in the United States could be lost if Trump followed through on his threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a study based on figures from US carmakers that manufacture in Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum said Thursday that further conversations were planned between her government and Trump's transition team before his January 20 inauguration. (AFP)

    Australia passes social media law banning youngsters

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia passed a law on Thursday to ban social media for children aged under 16 after days of heated debate, setting a standard for other countries to follow in a global push to curb the power of Big Tech.
 <br>
  <br>
  The law, expected to take effect in November 2025, sets some of the toughest social media controls in the world and will force platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a parliamentary session that went into the night, the country's Senate, or upper house of parliament, voted to pass the law after the centre-left Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese won support from the conservative opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate's approval for the law is the final legislative hurdle after the lower house, or House of Representatives, passed the bill on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese, trying to lift his approval ratings ahead of an election expected in May, had argued that social media posed risks to the physical and mental health of children and is looking for support from parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia plans to trial an age-verification system that may include biometrics or government identification to enforce the ban. The trial will run for several months and its findings would be reviewed by mid-2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the law, companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million (US$32 million) for breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  In submissions to parliament, Alphabet's Google and Meta said the ban should be delayed until the age-verification trial finishes, expected in mid-2025. Bytedance's TikTok said the bill needed more consultation, while Elon Musk's X argued the proposed law might hurt children's human rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Senate committee backed the bill this week, but also inserted a condition that social media platforms should not force users to submit personal data such as passport and other digital identification to prove their age. (Reuters)

<img alt="Prosecutors in Berlin have now linked the suspect to four more deaths. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781274_2_20241128204123.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German investigators suspect a Berlin doctor of killing eight elderly patients under his care and setting fire to some of their homes to cover up his crimes, prosecutors said Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unnamed suspect, 40, who worked in palliative care for a nursing service, was remanded in custody in August on suspicion of killing four women aged 72 to 94 and starting fires at their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors in Berlin have now linked the suspect to four more deaths of men and women aged between 61 and 83, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in August said the man was being investigated on four counts of manslaughter, one count of arson and three counts of attempted arson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Berlin prosecutors said they were now treating the alleged killings as murder cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The accused appears to have had no motive for killing the people other than the act of killing itself," they said, accusing him of a "lust for murder".
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in August said the man was suspected of killing four female patients in the care of his nursing service in Berlin between June 11 and July 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, an 87-year-old woman was resuscitated after emergency services arrived, but died later in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another, the suspect allegedly started a blaze but the fire went out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he realised this, he allegedly informed a relative of the woman and claimed that he was standing in front of her flat and that nobody was answering the doorbell," police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the four new cases, which date back to the period from June 2022 to April 2024, the suspect is accused of killing two men and two women in Berlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, he is suspected of administering a cocktail of medications to a 70-year-old female patient in her apartment in Berlin's Tempelhof district and then starting a fire to cover up his crime.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire department, called by a neighbour, was able to prevent the flames from spreading to the rest of the building.

<img alt="The encounter between Keir Starmer and the EU will be the first of its kind since London's 2020 departure from the bloc. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781265_1_20241128191850.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU will invite British premier Keir Starmer for talks on defence with the bloc's 27 leaders in February, Brussels said Thursday, as the two sides push to rebuild ties after Brexit.
 <br>
  <br>
  A senior European Union official said Brussels intends to organise "informal retreats", starting with a meeting in Belgium on February 3 focused on security issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The encounter would be the first of its kind between the EU and Britain since London's 2020 departure from the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For this one, the idea is to invite the secretary general of NATO and the UK prime minister," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outreach to Starmer is part of efforts to forge better ties after the acrimony caused by Britain's exit from the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British prime minister -- who came to power in July -- made his first visit to Brussels last month to launch the long road to a reset.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of those efforts, he agreed with European Commission chief to start holding regular summits between the two sides from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer's government has mooted reaching a "security pact" with the EU but details so far remain vague on what that would entail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister, who voted in the UK's 2016 Brexit referendum to remain in the EU, has insisted his reset will not mean reversing Brexit, which remains a politically toxic subject in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The February talks on defence will come at a crucial juncture, just after Donald Trump assumes power in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain and the EU have been staunch supporters of Ukraine in its war against Russia and are warily eyeing Trump's promises to end the conflict quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels is currently reshuffling its top leadership, with former Portuguese prime minister Antonio Costa set to replace Belgium's Charles Michel as head of the European Council on Sunday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Several members of Donald Trump's incoming administration have received threats including bomb alerts, the FBI said on Wednesday, with one nominee reporting a pipe-bomb scare sent with a pro-Palestinian message.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The FBI is aware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees, and we are working with our law enforcement partners," the agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swatting refers to the practice in which police are summoned urgently to someone's house under false pretenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, earlier said that several appointees and nominees “were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Elise Stefanik, a Trump loyalist congresswoman tapped to be UN ambassador, said her residence in New York was targeted in a bomb threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in a statement that she, her husband, and her three-year-old son were driving home from Washington for the Thanksgiving holiday when they learned of the threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Zeldin, Trump's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said his home was targeted with a pipe bomb threat sent with “a pro-Palestinian themed message.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The former congressman from New York said he and his family were not home at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he prepares to return to the White House in January, Trump has already swiftly assembled a cabinet of loyalists, including several criticised for a severe lack of experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican, who appears set to avoid trial on criminal prosecutions related to attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss, was wounded in the ear in July in an assassination attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has not commented on the apparent bomb threats. (AFP/Reuters)

<img alt="More than 10,000 protesters surged into the city, defying a lockdown and a ban on public gatherings to skirmish with 20,000 security forces. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781120_1_20241127210502.jpg&q=40">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan police said on Wednesday they had arrested nearly 1,000 protesters who marched on the capital Islamabad demanding the release of jailed ex-prime minister Imran Khan, after crowds were evicted from the city centre in a sweeping security crackdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan has been jailed since August 2023, sidelined by dozens of legal cases he claims were concocted to prevent his comeback in elections this year marred by rigging allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the February vote, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has defied a government crackdown with regular rallies, but Tuesday's gathering was by far the largest to grip the capital since the poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10,000 protesters surged into the city, defying a lockdown and a ban on public gatherings to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Islamabad Police Inspector General Ali Nasir Rizvi said 954 protesters had been arrested between Sunday and Tuesday, when crowds came within 1.6 kilometres of a public square they aimed to occupy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said at least one police officer and four state paramilitary personnel had been killed, before the main thoroughfare was cleared by forces armed with tear gas and batons early on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement that security forces had "bravely repulsed the protesters" as PTI told activists on social media the rally was cancelled "for the time being."
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan made a statement from his cell outside Islamabad calling supporters to the capital on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the crowds were led by his key lieutenant Ali Amin Gandapur and his wife Bushra Bibi, who was also jailed earlier this year but released last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The movement is continuing and it will be ended only by Imran Khan," said Gandapur after retreating from Islamabad to northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where he serves as chief minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called the protests "extremism." Since Sunday, his ministers have held regular press conferences in central Islamabad vowing no mercy for the oncoming marchers. (AFP)

<img alt="Hassan Fadlallah (centre) said there was full cooperation with the Lebanese state. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781121_1_20241127211249.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said on Wednesday his group was cooperating with the army's deployment to southern Lebanon under the terms of a new truce with Israel, insisting "there will be no problem there".
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came as Lebanon's army said it had begun reinforcing its presence in the south, and as tens of thousands of residents streamed home after the sealing of an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire following more than a year of hostilities and two months of all-out war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to an AFP question about Hezbollah fighters' withdrawal north of the Litani River in accordance with the ceasefire deal, Fadlallah said the matter was "linked to Lebanese state measures and strengthening the army presence".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is full cooperation on this issue and there will be no problem there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lebanese military said Wednesday that it had "begun reinforcing its presence in the South Litani sector and extending the state's authority in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)".
  <br>
  <br>
  An AFP journalist saw army troops and vehicles in two areas of south Lebanon on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fadlallah went on to say that Hezbollah had "no visible weapons or bases" in the south, but at the same time, noted the group "is a secret resistance... not a regular army".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hezbollah's people are the people of these villages and towns, and most of the dead are from these villages," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nobody can make residents leave their villages."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon says at least 3,823 people have been killed in the country since exchanges of cross-border fire began in October 2023, most of them in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the army would shore up its presence in the country's south, while urging Israel to withdraw and respect the ceasefire that came into force on Wednesday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s weather agency said the capital, Seoul, was blanketed on Wednesday by the heaviest November snowfall since records began over a century ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The snowstorm grounded hundreds of flights and disrupted commuter traffic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said 20 centimetres of snow fell in northern parts of Seoul and nearby areas, compared to the city's previous record of 12.4 centimetres on November 28, 1972.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap news agency said one person died and four others were injured in a five-vehicle accident in the eastern town of Hongcheon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm blanketed much of the country, with the country’s central, eastern and southwestern regions seeing about 10 to 23 centimetres of snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 220 flights were cancelled or delayed at airports nationwide, while authorities ordered around 90 ferries to remain at port. They also shut down hundreds of hiking trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Icy road conditions slowed down the morning commute in Seoul, while emergency workers across the country responded to fallen trees, signs, and other safety risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather agency said snowfall would continue in most parts of the country until Thursday. (Agencies)

    Aussie social media bill closer to becoming law

<img alt="Australian legislation banning social media for people under 16 is closer to reality after it passed through the country's lower house of Parliament on Wednesday. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781021_1_20241127122816.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia on Wednesday moved closer to banning social media for children under 16 after the parliament's lower house passed the bill even as Alphabet's Google and Facebook-owner Meta pressed the government to delay the legislation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Australia's House of Representatives passed the bill 102 votes to 13 after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's centre-left Labor government secured bipartisan support for the ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate is expected to debate the bill later on Wednesday, with the government keen to ensure it is passed by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With widespread support of the bill, analysts said this all but guarantees the legislation will pass in the Senate, where no party holds a majority of seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it becomes law this week, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restrictions before the penalties are enforced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese, trying to lift his approval ratings ahead of an election expected in May, has argued that excessive use of social media poses risks to the physical and mental health of children and is looking for support from parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The planned law would force social media platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place. Companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million (US$32 million) for systemic breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition lawmaker Dan Tehan told Parliament the government had agreed to accept amendments in the Senate that would bolster privacy protections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver’s licences. The platforms also could not demand digital identification through a government system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Will it be perfect? No. But is any law perfect? No, it’s not. But if it helps, even if it helps in just the smallest of ways, it will make a huge difference to people’s lives,” Tehan told Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some youth advocates including Australia's human rights commission raised concerns the law would hurt children's rights to self-expression, but a YouGov survey released on Tuesday showed 77 percent of Australians backed the ban, up from 61 percent in an August survey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers who were not aligned with either the government or the opposition were most critical of the legislation during the debate on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were criticisms the legislation had been rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents’ authority to decide what’s best for their children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encountered and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Independent lawmaker Zoe Daniel said the legislation would “make zero difference to the harms that are inherent to social media.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The true object of this legislation is not to make social media safe by design, but to make parents and voters feel like the government is doing something about it,” Daniel told Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is a reason why the government parades this legislation as world-leading, that’s because no other country wants to do it,” she added. (Agencies)

    Ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah takes effect

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon took effect on Wednesday, after more than a year of fighting that has killed thousands of people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The truce, which began before dawn, should bring a halt to a war that has forced tens of thousands of people in Israel and hundreds of thousands more in Lebanon to flee their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  An international panel led by the United States will monitor compliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire does not address the war in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's security cabinet approved the US-France-brokered agreement after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented it, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war has seen swathes of Lebanon pounded by air strikes and Israeli troops deployed across the border to battle Hezbollah militants.
  <br>
  <br>
  It began with Hezbollah launching cross-border strikes in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
  <br>

  Lebanon says at least 3,823 people have been killed in the country since then -- most of them in the past several weeks, when Israel escalated its campaign against Hezbollah.

  On the Israeli side, the hostilities with Hezbollah have killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities say. (Agencies)

    Russia vows response to latest Ukraine ATACMS strikes

<div class="itemFullText">
 Moscow's military on Tuesday pledged a response to fresh Ukrainian air attacks inside Russia using US-supplied ATACMS missiles.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine firing the long-range missiles into Russia for the first time last week prompted a furious reaction from Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's defence ministry on Tuesday said Ukraine had carried out fresh strikes on November 23 and 25 using ATACMS.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Retaliatory actions are being prepared," it said in a post on Telegram, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States gave Ukraine permission to use the weapons to hit Russian territory earlier this month after months of requests from Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a rare admission, Russia said the fresh strikes had caused damage to military hardware and wounded some of its personnel on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  A strike on the Kursk Vostochny air base wounded two servicemen, the defence ministry said, while a strike on an air defence battery damaged a radar system and also caused "casualties".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said three of the five missiles fired in the first strike were shot down, while seven of the eight used in the second were destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow rarely provides such specific details on Ukrainian aerial attacks and almost never admits missiles have reached their intended target.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence ministry also posted photos of what it said were the missile fragments, showing large casings with English-language inscriptions on the side.
  <br>
  <br>
  The images could not be immediately verified.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes come with tensions having ratcheted up dramatically in the near three-year conflict over the last few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin last week signed a decree lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, days before launching the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik missile at Ukraine. (AFP)

    Biden proposes weight loss drugs under Medicare

<img alt="Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese would qualify for coverage. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780923_1_20241126195823.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed on Tuesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The costly proposal from the US Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labelled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as US$35 billion over the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,” US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. “It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The rule would not be finalised until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese — someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher — would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese. (AP)

    World oldest man John Tinniswood dies aged 112

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world's oldest man, Briton John Tinniswood, has died aged 112 at the care home where he lived in Southport, northwest England, Guinness World Records said on Tuesday, quoting his family.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tinniswood was born in Liverpool on August 26, 1912, and died on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He became the world's oldest man in April following the death of 114-year-old Venezuelan Juan Vicente Perez.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His last day was surrounded by music and love," the family said in a statement, also thanking "all those who cared for him over the years".
  <br>
  <br>
  Born the same year the Titanic sank and living through both World Wars, Tinniswood told Guinness World Records that the secret to his longevity was "pure luck".
  <br>
  <br>
  "You either live long or you live short, and you can't do much about it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He nonetheless advised moderation in all things to stay healthy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you drink too much or you eat too much or you walk too much, if you do too much of anything, you're going to suffer eventually," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  During World War Two, Tinniswood held an administrative role in the Royal Army Pay Corps, going on to work in accounts for oil giants Shell and BP.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was a life-long supporter of Liverpool football club, and ate fish and chips every Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's oldest living woman currently is Japan's Tomiko Itooka, who is 116.

    Tourist boat sinks off Egypt's Red Sea coast

<div class="itemFullText">
 Egyptian officials said 16 people were missing after a tourist yacht sank in the Red Sea on Monday after warnings of rough waters.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red Sea Governor Amr Hanafi said preliminary reports suggested a sudden large wave struck the boat, capsizing it within five to seven minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some passengers were in their cabins, which is why they were unable to escape," he added in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hanafi said rescuers saved 28 people from the vessel south of the coastal town of Marsa Alam.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the Red Sea Governorate said the 28 had only minor injuries, such as bruises and scrapes, with none requiring hospitalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governorate said a distress call was received just before dawn from the boat, which had departed from Porto Ghalib in Marsa Alam on Sunday with plans to return to Hurghada Marina on November 29.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 44 people were onboard the yacht, including 13 Egyptians, who include crew members, and 31 foreign nationals from the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Poland, Belgium, Switzerland, Finland, China, Slovakia, Spain, and Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Embassy in Egypt said two Chinese tourists were rescued by other vessels passing through the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy has contacted both tourists, who are said to be in good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the second boat to sink in the area this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, a boat sank after it suffered severe damage from strong waves. No casualties were reported in that incident. (Agencies)

    Protesters demand release of Pakistan's Imran Khan

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of protesters calling for the release of Pakistan's jailed ex-prime minister Imran Khan defied roadblocks and tear gas to march to the gates of the nation's capital on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government said one police officer was killed and nine were critically wounded in two days of clashes with demonstrators as they closed in on Islamabad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan was barred from standing in February elections that were marred by allegations of rigging.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sidelined by dozens of legal cases which he claimed were fabricated to prevent his comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has defied a government crackdown with regular demonstrations, aiming to seize public spaces in Islamabad and other large cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The capital has been locked down since late Saturday, with mobile internet sporadically cut and more than 20,000 police flooding the streets, many armed with riot shields and batons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the Islamabad city administration announced a two-month ban on public gatherings.
  <br>
  <br>
  But PTI convoys travelled from their power base in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the most populous eastern province of Punjab, hauling aside roadblocks of stacked shipping containers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the early hours of Tuesday, protesters were clashing with police who were firing tear gas and rubber bullets at a motorway entry to Islamabad.
  <br>
  <br>
  PTI's chief demand is the release of Khan, the 72-year-old charismatic former cricket star who served as premier from 2018 to 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been jailed since August 2023, facing legal accusations ranging from illegal marriage to graft and inciting riots. (AFP)

    China 'open to dialogue' after Trump tariff threat

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it remains "open to dialogue" with the United States after president-elect Donald Trump vowed to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China and elsewhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As a principle, we are open to maintaining dialogue and communication," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing, after being asked whether Beijing had reached out to Trump's team for talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in the US said "no one will win a trade war" after Trump said he intends to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico in response to illegal drug trade and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature," Liu Pengyu, an embassy spokesman said in an email to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a series of posts to his Truth Social account on Monday, Trump vowed to hit some of Washington's largest trading partners with duties on all goods entering the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25 percent tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another post, Trump said he would be slapping China with a 10 percent tariff, "above any additional Tariffs," on all of its products entering the US in response to what he said was its failure to tackle fentanyl smuggling.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Canberra, China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, said on Tuesday that the US policy on trade with China and other countries would have an impact on relations between China and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "US policy on trade with China, with other countries as well, will have an impact and that is an important element that we have to consider," Xiao told a press conference in Canberra, in response to a question on whether potential tariffs by Trump would impact China and Australia's bilateral relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada described its trade relationship with the US "mutually beneficial".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will of course continue to discuss these issues with the incoming administration," said a statement from Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many economists have warned that tariffs would hurt growth and push up inflation, since they are primarily paid by importers bringing the goods into the US, who often pass those costs on to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But those in Trump's inner circle have insisted that the tariffs are a useful bargaining chip for the US to use to push its trading partners to agree to more favourable terms, and to bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas. (Agencies)

    Former king Juan Carlos sued for alleged tax offences

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's disgraced former king Juan Carlos is being sued for alleged tax offences by a group of retired judges, one of the complainants said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spanish prosecutors in March 2022 closed three probes into his finances due to insufficient evidence and the statute of limitations, but said several irregularities had been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them were lucrative gifts from Gulf Arab monarchies and private trips funded by a foundation based in the tiny European state of Liechtenstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The complainants say a court rather than public prosecutors must decide if Juan Carlos fulfilled his tax obligations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Carlos, 86, has made two payments worth more than five million euros to the Spanish tax authorities to settle money owed on undeclared income, widely viewed as a bid to avoid charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  His regularisation of income declarations from 2014 to 2018 "were not done in accordance with the law", former Spanish Supreme Court judge Jose Antonio Martin Pallin told public broadcaster TVE.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not have the slightest interest in prison sentences being applied," but the harshest possible fine should be imposed, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legal experts, philosophers and journalists were also among the complainants, Pallin said, without specifying their number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Carlos enjoyed widespread admiration for his role in Spain's transition to democracy following the death of longtime dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the revelations about the murky origins of his fortune since his abdication in 2014 have done irreparable damage to his reputation and harmed the Spanish monarchy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He went into self-imposed exile in the United Arab Emirates in 2020. (AFP)

 A DHL cargo plane crashed as it came in to land at Lithuania's Vilnius airport early on Monday morning, killing one person on the aircraft and with some debris damaging a house.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three other people onboard were injured but no one on the ground was hurt, officials said. Flames and smoke engulfed the crashed plane as fire crews worked to extinguish the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheduled flight was operated by airline Swiftair on behalf of DHL and had taken off from Leipzig, Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the crash was not immediately known and officials said there was no indication so far that it might be a case of sabotage, although Germany is investigating several fires caused by incendiary devices hidden inside parcels at a warehouse in Leipzig for delivery by DHL earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuanian counter-intelligence chief Darius Jauniskis told reporters: "We cannot reject the possibility of terrorism...but at the moment we can't make attributions or point fingers, because we don't have such information."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-400 crashed around 0330 GMT while approaching Vilnius airport for landing, a spokesperson for Lithuania's National Crisis Management Centre said. The flight had departed from Leipzig at 0208 GMT, Flightradar24 said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security camera footage showed an aircraft descending behind a warehouse after which the night sky was lit up in bright red and orange colours followed by plumes of thick dark smoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue services said the plane hit the ground, split into pieces and slid over 100 metres. Some debris hit a house.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the recording of the conversation between the pilots and the tower, the pilots, until the very last second did not tell the tower of any extraordinary event," said Marius Baranauskas, head of the Lithuanian National Aviation Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to examine the black boxes to know what was happening in the aircraft," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuanian police and prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the incident, and a specialised unit in the Justice Ministry will carry out a civil aviation incident probe, the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only these investigations will answer questions on the real reasons of the incident, speculations and guesses will really not help to determine the truth", Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Lithuanian police spokesperson said one person onboard, a Spanish citizen, was killed and three others - Spanish, German and Lithuanian citizens - were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police told a press conference 12 people had been evacuated from the house hit by debris. There were no casualties on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters poured water onto the smoking building some 1.3 km north of the airport runway and nearby streets were cordoned off.
  <br>
  <br>
  DHL has launched its own investigation into the crash, a spokesperson for the company's Lithuanian arm told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aircraft contained regular parcels. We do not have any information that any of them were suspicious," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A European Union Aviation Safety Agency spokesperson said it was too early to comment on the causes of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 737-400 aircraft involved in the accident was 31 years old, according to a Flightradar24 database. Boeing was working to gather more information and would provide any support, a Boeing spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiftair declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  German security authorities are also investigating the crash and are in close contact with domestic and foreign authorities, a security source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany is already investigating several fires caused by incendiary devices hidden inside parcels at a warehouse in Leipzig earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  British police are investigating a warehouse fire in Birmingham in July, caused by a package catching alight, and liaising with other European law enforcement agencies to see if there was a connection with similar incidents elsewhere.
  <br>

    Far-right candidate surprises in Romania elections
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A little-known, far-right populist took the lead in Romania’s presidential election on Sunday, electoral data showed, and will likely face leftist Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu in a run-off vote in two weeks, an outcome that has rocked the country's political landscape.
 <br>
  <br>
  Calin Georgescu, who ran independently, led the polls with around 22 percent of the vote, while Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party, or PSD, trailed at 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party, or USR, stood at about 18 percent, and George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, took around 14 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After polls closed, 9.4 million people — about 52 percent of eligible voters — had cast their ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second round of the vote will be held December 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen candidates ran for the presidency in the European Union and Nato member country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president serves a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georgescu, 62, ran independently and was not widely known. He outperformed most local surveys, sending shockwaves through Romania's political establishment as he ascended to poll position.
  <br>
  <br>
  After casting his ballot on Sunday, Georgescu said in a post on Facebook that he voted “For the unjust, for the humiliated, for those who feel they do not matter and actually matter the most.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, said that Georgescu’s unexpected poll performance appears to be a “large protest or revolt against the establishment.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The mainstream political parties have lost the connection with regular Romanians,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georgescu lacks an agenda, Andrei added, and has a vague and populist manifesto with positions that are “beyond the normal discourse."
  <br>
  <br>
  His stances include supporting Romanian farmers, reducing dependency on imports, and ramping up energy and food production.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to his website, Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania's environment ministry in the 1990s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted to his popular TikTok account, where he has amassed 1.6 million likes, depict him attending church, doing judo, running around an oval track, and speaking on podcasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Sunday's vote, many had expected to see Simion, a vocal supporter of US President-elect Donald Trump, face Ciolacu in the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  He campaigned for reunification with Moldova, which this year renewed a five-year ban on him entering the country over security concerns, and he is banned for the same reason from neighbouring Ukraine. (AP)

    Leftist candidate wins Uruguay presidential election

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The presidential candidate of the conservative coalition that has governed Uruguay for the past five years conceded defeat on Sunday after a tight run-off election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The results means the South American nation joined others around the world in rebuking the incumbent party in a year of landmark elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even as the vote count continued, Álvaro Delgado, the centre-right government’s candidate, told supporters at his campaign headquarters in the capital of Montevideo that “with sadness, but without guilt, we can congratulate the winner,” referring to left-wing challenger Yamandú Orsi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fireworks erupted over the stage where Orsi, 57, a working-class former history teacher and two-time mayor from Uruguay's centre-left coalition known as the Broad Front, claimed victory as crowds flocked to greet him.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The country of liberty, equality and fraternity has triumphed once again,” he said, vowing to unite the nation of 3.4 million people after such a tight vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Let's understand that there is another part of our country who have different feelings today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These people will also have to help build a better country. We need them too.”
  <br>
  <br>
  With more than 91 percent of the votes counted, Orsi had close to 50 percent support compared to Delgado’s 46 percent in an election in which nearly 90 percent of voters turned out, according to preliminary data released by the Electoral Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest were blank votes or non-voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  While failing to entice apathetic young voters and generating extraordinary indecision, Uruguay's lacklustre electoral campaigns steered clear of the anti-establishment fury that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere in the world, like in the United States and neighbouring Argentina.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people have been arrested in the United Arab Emirates in connection with the alleged murder of an Israeli citizen, the Emirati interior ministry said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ministry statement did not give details on the suspects or say if they had been charged, but said all legal powers would be used "to respond decisively and without leniency to any actions or attempts that threaten societal stability".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office had denounced the killing of the rabbi, Zvi Kogan, 28, as a "heinous anti-semitic terrorist act" and said Israel would do everything it could to bring those responsible to justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local authorities say Kogan was a resident of the UAE and a Moldovan national.
  <br>
  <br>
  He worked with the New York-based Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement and was reported missing on Thursday. His body was found on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He ran a kosher grocery store in Dubai, where Israelis have flocked for commerce and tourism since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in the 2020 Abraham Accords.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement has held through more than a year of soaring regional tensions unleashed by Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza and its attack of Lebanon, after months of fighting with the Hezbollah militant group, have stoked anger among Emiratis, Arab nationals and others living in the UAE.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Sunday, the UAE’s state-run WAM news agency acknowledged Kogan’s disappearance but pointedly did not acknowledge he held Israeli citizenship, referring to him only as being Moldovan. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistani government team mediated a seven-day ceasefire deal between rival sectarian groups on Sunday, halting days of clashes that have killed some 70 people and injured dozens in the northwest of the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The violence began when gunmen attacked convoys of civilian vehicles on Thursday, killing at least 40 people, mostly Shi'ite Muslims.
  <br>
  <br>
  That sparked retaliatory attacks against Sunni Muslim residents and there were pitched battles between armed groups from both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armed Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims have engaged in tribal and sectarian rivalry for decades over a land dispute in Kurram district near the Afghanistan border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both sides have agreed to a week-long ceasefire which is expected to be extended," Muhammad Ali Saif, a member of the mediation team, told Reuters by phone, adding that major clashes had already stopped.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saif, who is the information minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province - where Kurram is located - said both sides also agreed to exchange prisoners, including women and the bodies of those killed in the clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prisoners and bodies would be exchanged with assistance from Pakistani paramilitary forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team flew into Parachinar, Kurram's main city, on Saturday and met Shi'ite and Sunni tribal leaders with the entire district under curfew and armed groups roaming the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saif said news of the ceasefire should also halt smaller skirmishes that had been reported in remote areas of the district.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another member of the mediation team, Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, the police chief of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said Shi'ite leaders were demanding the immediate arrest of those involved in attacking passenger vehicles, as well as compensation for the victims and safety assurances for travelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is yet to identify or publicly name who the attackers were and no one has claimed responsibility. (Reuters)

<img alt="Josep Borrell (pictured) speaks during a press conference after meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri in Beirut. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780634_1_20241124203648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for an "immediate ceasefire" in the Israel-Hezbollah war while on a visit to the Lebanese capital for talks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since September 23, Israel has intensified its air campaign in Lebanon, later sending in ground troops following nearly a year of limited exchanges of fire initiated by Hezbollah in support of its ally Hamas after the Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see only one possible way ahead: an immediate ceasefire and the full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701," Borrell said after meeting Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who has led mediation efforts on behalf of Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Resolution 1701 ended the last Hezbollah-Israel war of 2006 and stated that Lebanese troops and UN peacekeepers should be the only armed forces in the country's south, where Hezbollah holds sway.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also called for Israel to withdraw troops from Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Back in September I came and was still hoping we could prevent a full-fledged war of Israel attacking Lebanon," Borrell said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two months later Lebanon is on the brink of collapse."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the European Union was ready to provide 200 million euros for Lebanon's army, whose deployment in larger numbers along the border forms a crucial point in truce talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  France and Washington have been spearheading ceasefire efforts, with US envoy Amos Hochstein visiting Lebanon and Israel this week to discuss a truce plan based on implementing Resolution 1701.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must pressure the Israeli government and maintain the pressure on Hezbollah to accept the US proposal for a ceasefire," Borrell said, calling for an "immediate" truce. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Raging orange flames and thick black smoke billowed into the sky on Sunday as fire ripped through hundreds of houses in a closely built slum area of the Philippine capital Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manila Fire District said around 1,000 houses were burned in the blaze that is thought to have started on the second floor of one of the homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no immediate reports of casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drone footage shared online by the city's disaster agency showed houses in Isla Puting Bato village of Manila razed to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  The structures housed around 2,000 families, according to the fire department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Village resident Leonila Abiertas, 65, lost almost all her possessions, but managed to save her late husband's ashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only got the urn with the ashes of my husband," a crying Abiertas told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really don't know how I can start my life again after this fire."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire and disaster services deployed 36 trucks and four fire boats while the country's air force sent in two helicopters to help extinguish the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That area is fire-prone since most of the houses there are made of light materials," firefighter Geanelli Nunez told AFP. (AFP)

 A man was shot dead and three members of the security services wounded after gunfire at dawn on Sunday in the neighbourhood in Jordan's capital where the Israeli embassy is located, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Public Security Directorate announced that it dealt with an incident of gunfire at a patrol operating in the Rabieh area in the capital, Amman, at dawn on Sunday," the official Petra news agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said a gunman opened fire on a patrol and was later surrounded by security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man "started firing gunshots at the security force, which in turn applied the rules of engagement, which resulted in the killing of the perpetrator", the agency added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said three public security personnel were injured during the incident and were receiving treatment. (AFP)

    Climate summit US$300bn deal 'a paltry sum'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The world approved a bitterly negotiated climate deal on Sunday but poorer nations most at the mercy of worsening disasters dismissed a US$300 billion a year pledge from wealthy historic polluters as insultingly low.
 <br>
  <br>
  After two exhausting weeks of chaotic bargaining and sleepless nights, nearly 200 nations banged through the contentious finance pact in the early hours in a sports stadium in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the applause had barely subsided in Baku when India delivered a full-throated rejection of the dollar-figure just agreed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount that is proposed to be mobilised is abysmally poor. It's a paltry sum," said Indian delegate Leena Nandan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This document is little more than an optical illusion. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nations had struggled to reconcile long-standing divisions over how much rich nations most accountable for historic climate change should provide to poorer countries least responsible but most impacted by Earth's rapid warming.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra said COP29 would be remembered as "the start of a new era for climate finance".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sleep-deprived diplomats, huddled in anxious groups, were still revising the final phrasing on the plenary floor hours before the deal passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  At points, the talks appeared on the brink of collapse, with developing nations storming out of meetings and threatening to walk away should rich nations not cough up more cash.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the end -- despite repeating that no deal is better than a bad deal -- they did not stand in the way of an agreement, despite it falling well short of what they wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final deal commits developed nations to pay at least US$300 billion a year by 2035 to help developed countries green their economies and prepare for worse disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is up from US$100 billion under an existing pledge but was slammed as offensively low by developing nations who had demanded much more.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This COP has been a disaster for the developing world," said Mohamed Adow, the Kenyan director of Power Shift Africa, a think tank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a betrayal of both people and planet, by wealthy countries who claim to take climate change seriously."
  <br>
  <br>
  A group of 134 developing countries had pushed for at least US$500 billion from rich governments to build resilience against climate change and cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN climate chief Simon Stiell acknowledged the deal was imperfect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country got everything they wanted, and we leave Baku with a mountain of work still to do. So this is no time for victory laps," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States and EU have wanted newly wealthy emerging economies like China -- the world's largest emitter -- to chip in.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final deal "encourages" developing countries to make contributions on a voluntary basis, reflecting no change for China which already provides climate finance on its own terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy nations said it was politically unrealistic to expect more in direct government funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump, a sceptic of both climate change and foreign assistance, returns to the White House in January and a number of other Western countries have seen right-wing backlashes against the green agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal posits a larger overall target of US$1.3 trillion per year to cope with rising temperatures and disasters, but most would come from private sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy countries and small island nations were also concerned by efforts led by Saudi Arabia to water down calls from last year's summit in Dubai to phase out fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main texts proposed in Baku lacked any explicit mention of the Dubai commitment to "transitioning away from fossil fuels".
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of countries had accused Azerbaijan, an authoritarian oil and gas exporter, of lacking the experience and will to meet the moment, as the planet again sets temperature records and faces rising deadly disasters. (AFP)

    Sudan army says recaptures key state capital

<img alt="Since April 2023, the war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 11 million. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780565_1_20241123223549.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sudanese army said on Saturday it had retaken a key state capital south of Khartoum from rival paramilitaries who had held it for the past five months.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Sennar state capital of Sinja is a strategic prize in the 19-month-old war between the regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces as it lies on a key road linking army-controlled areas of eastern and central Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army said that Sinja had been "liberated... from the terrorist militia."
  <br>
  <br>
  It posted footage on social media that it said had been filmed inside the main base in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sinja has returned to the embrace of the nation," the information minister of the army-backed government, Khaled al-Aiser, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aiser's office said armed forces chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan had travelled to the city of Sennar, 60 kilometres to the north, on Saturday to "inspect the operation and celebrate the liberation of Sinja."
  <br>
  <br>
  The RSF had taken the two cities in a lightning offensive in June that saw nearly 726,000 civilians flee, according to UN figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Human rights groups have said that those who were unwilling or unable to leave have faced months of arbitrary violence by RSF fighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinja teacher Abdullah al-Hassan spoke of his "indescribable joy" at seeing the army enter the city after "months of terror."
  <br>
  <br>
  "At any moment, you were waiting for militia fighters to barge in and beat you or loot you," the 53-year-old said by telephone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides in the Sudanese conflict have been accused of war crimes, including indiscriminately shelling homes, markets and hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The RSF has also been accused of summary executions, systematic sexual violence and rampant looting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The paramilitaries control nearly all of the vast western region of Darfur as well as large swathes of Kordofan in the south. They also hold much of the capital Khartoum and the key farming state of Al-Jazira to its south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since April 2023, the war has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 11 million – creating what the UN says is the world's largest displacement crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the eastern state of Gedaref – where more than 1.1 million displaced people have sought refuge – Asia Khedr, 46, said she hoped her family's ordeal might soon be at an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll finally go home and say goodbye to this life of displacement and suffering," she said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain and Ireland faced travel chaos on Saturday as a winter storm battered northwest Europe with strong winds, heavy rain, snow and ice.
 <br>
  <br>
  Storm Bert left at least 60,000 properties in Ireland without power and closed roads and some ferry and train routes on both sides of the Irish Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Media footage showed flooding in the west of Ireland, while floods prompted rail closures in Northern Ireland and snow impacted travel across Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heaviest snow hit Scotland and parts of northern and central England, with dozens of flood alerts in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK Met Office issued warnings for snow and ice for those regions, warning there was a "good chance some rural communities could be cut off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scottish hills could see up to 40 centimetres of snow, while winds approaching 113 kilometres per hour were recorded in parts of Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferry operator DFDS cancelled services on some routes until Monday, with sailings from Newhaven and Dover in southern England to Dieppe and Calais in France severely affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flights were disrupted at Newcastle Airport due to heavy snow, with some flights diverted to Belfast and Edinburgh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avanti West Coast, which runs rail services between England and Scotland, advised customers not to attempt travel beyond the northern English city of Preston, as it cancelled numerous trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Highways also issued a "severe weather alert," warning of "blizzard conditions" affecting Yorkshire and northeast England, with a number of road closures announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Met Eireann, the Irish National Meteorological Service, had also issued a yellow warning for "very strong winds and heavy rain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The worst impacted areas for power outages in Ireland were in western and northwestern counties, according to ESB Networks, which runs the country's electricity system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Crews and contractors are deployed and restoring power in impacted areas where it is safe to do so," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 4,000 properties across Britain were without power by mid-Saturday -- the majority in southwest England – with the National Grid operator saying power had been restored to "many homes and businesses."
  <br>

  Blackburn Rovers Championship football fixture against Portsmouth was postponed because of the storm. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lebanon said an Israeli air strike in the heart of Beirut that brought down a residential building and jolted residents across the city killed at least 11 people on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The attack in the capital was followed by others in the city's southern suburbs after calls by the Israeli military to evacuate the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has not commented on the strike in central Beirut, while Hezbollah has yet to mention it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue operations were underway in the area on Saturday morning, with an excavator removing the rubble of the eight-storey building, and a fire truck and civil defence rescuers stationed nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The strike was so strong it felt like the building was about to fall on our heads," said Samir, 60, who lives in a building facing the one that was destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he fled his home in the middle of the night with his wife and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw two dead people on the ground... The children started crying and their mother cried even more," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli strike, which hit the working-class Basta neighbourhood, killed at least 11 people and wounded 63, Lebanon's health ministry said, adding it had also left behind "a large amount of body parts that are being identified."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The final death toll will be determined after DNA tests are carried out," the ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The state-run National News Agency said Israeli jets had launched six missiles at the structure, causing "widespread destruction in buildings" nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pre-dawn attack in Basta was not preceded by an evacuation warning from Israel's military.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Lebanese security source said on condition of anonymity that the strike had "targeted a leading Hezbollah figure," though it was unclear if they were killed. The official did not name the figure. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea has decided not to attend a memorial ceremony set to take place in Japan to honour wartime forced labour victims, including many Koreans, its foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing unspecified disagreements with Tokyo.
 <br>
  <br>
  The East Asian neighbours have long been at odds over historical issues linked to Japan's brutal colonial occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including sexual slavery and forced labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, a network of mines on a Japanese island infamous for using conscripted wartime labour was added to Unesco's World Heritage register, after South Korea voiced objections to its listing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul had dropped its initial objections "on the condition that Japan faithfully implements the recommendation... to reflect the 'full history' at the Sado Gold Mine site."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo had agreed to host a memorial event every year – its first edition set to be held on Sado Island on Sunday – to honour the forced labour victims, as a condition for South Korea's consent to the Unesco listing.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Saturday, Seoul said the country would "not attend the Sado mine memorial ceremony, scheduled for November 24, taking into account various circumstances surrounding the event."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was insufficient time to reconcile differing positions between the diplomatic authorities of both countries, making it unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable agreement before the ceremony," it added, without elaborating further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo said earlier this week that Akiko Ikuina, a parliamentary vice minister at Japan's foreign ministry, will attend the ceremony as the government's representative, according to Seoul's Yonhap news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was met with criticism from some local media outlets in Seoul, as she has visited the Yasukuni Shrine – a site considered highly sensitive in South Korea due to the enshrinement of some of Japan's war criminals there. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 32 people were killed and 47 wounded in sectarian clashes in northwest Pakistan, an official said on Saturday, two days after attacks on Shi'ite passenger convoys killed 43.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sporadic fighting between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims in the mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan has killed around 150 over the past months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fighting between Shi'ite and Sunni communities continues at multiple locations. According to the latest reports, 32 people have been killed which include 14 Sunnis and 18 Shi'ites," a senior administrative official said on condition of anonymity on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, gunmen opened fire on two separate convoys of Shi'ite Muslims travelling with a police escort in Kurram, killing 43 while 11 wounded are still in "critical condition", officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In retaliation, Shi'ite Muslims on Friday evening attacked several Sunni locations in the Kurram district, once a semi-autonomous region, where sectarian violence has resulted in the deaths of hundreds over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Around 7 pm (1400 GMT), a group of enraged Shi'ite individuals attacked the Sunni-dominated Bagan Bazaar," said a senior police officer stationed in Kurram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After firing, they set the entire market ablaze and entered nearby homes, pouring petrol and setting them on fire. Initial reports suggest over 300 shops and more than 100 houses have been burned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local Sunnis "also fired back at the attackers," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Javedullah Mehsud, a senior official in Kurram said there were "efforts to restore peace ... (through) the deployment of security forces" and with the help of "local elders." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union, United States and other wealthy countries at the COP29 climate summit have agreed to raise their offer of a global finance target to US$300 billion per year by 2035, sources said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The summit had been due to finish on Friday but ran into overtime as negotiators from nearly 200 countries – who must adopt the deal by consensus – tried to reach agreement on the world's climate funding plan for the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shift in position came after a US$250 billion proposal for a deal, drafted by Azerbaijan's COP29 presidency on Friday, was panned by developing countries as insultingly low.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear if the wealthy countries' revised position had been communicated to developing countries at COP29, and whether it would be enough to win their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five sources with knowledge of the closed-door discussions said the EU had agreed they could accept the higher number. Two of the sources said the United States, Australia and Britain were also on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  A European Commission spokesperson and an Australian government spokesperson both declined to comment on the negotiations. The US delegation at COP29 and the UK energy ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates were awaiting a new draft text of the deal on climate finance on Saturday after negotiators worked through the night to bridge wide gaps in their positions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The COP29 talks have laid bare the divisions between wealthy governments constrained by tight domestic budgets and developing nations reeling from the soaring costs of storms, floods and droughts fuelled by climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new goal is intended to replace developed countries' previous commitment to provide US$100 billion in climate finance for poorer nations per year by 2020. That goal was met two years late, in 2022, and expires in 2025. (Reuters)

    Fears for Gaza hospitals as fuel and aid run low

<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Friday that hospitals have only two days' fuel left before they must restrict services, after the United Nations warned aid delivery to the war-devastated territory is being crippled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The warning came a day after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant more than a year into the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN and others have repeatedly decried humanitarian conditions, particularly in northern Gaza, where Israel said on Friday it had killed two commanders involved in Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza medics said an overnight Israeli raid on the cities of Beit Lahia and nearby Jabalia resulted in dozens killed or missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marwan al-Hams, director of Gaza's field hospitals, told reporters all hospitals in the Palestinian territory "will stop working or reduce their services within 48 hours due to the occupation's (Israel's) obstruction of fuel entry".
  <br>
  <br>
  World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was "deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of 80 patients, including 8 in the intensive care unit" at Kamal Adwan hospital, one of just two partly operating in northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late Thursday, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Muhannad Hadi, said, "The delivery of critical aid across Gaza, including food, water, fuel and medical supplies, is grinding to a halt."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that for more than six weeks, Israeli authorities "have been banning commercial imports" while "a surge in armed looting" has hit aid convoys. (AFP)

<img alt="The Hieron Museum, one of France's oldest for sacred art, has been targeted several times in recent years. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780441_1_20241122194124.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Armed robbers snatched jewels worth millions from a work by famed Parisian goldsmith Joseph Chaumet and classed a national treasure in a brazen heist at a French museum.
 <br>
  <br>
  Motorbike-riding thieves arrived at the Hieron Museum in Paray-le-Monial in central France at around 4:00 pm (1500 GMT) on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three entered the building and one stood guard outside, mayor Jean-Marc Nesme said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group fired several shots before heading for the museum's star exhibit, a three-metre work executed in 1904 depicting the life of Christ in precious metals, jewels and ivory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known as "Via Vitae", it is classed as a national treasure by France's culture ministry, with an estimated value of up to seven million euros (US$7.3 million), mayor Nesme said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intruders sawed through the armoured glass protecting the piece with a power tool before snatching gold and ivory figurines as well as emerald decorations from the piece.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gigantic piece comprises 138 figures encrusted with diamonds and rubies set in marble of various shades and alabaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they fled on their motorbikes, the gang sowed spikes across the road to hobble two pursuing vehicles, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a great loss for Paray-le-Monial and for national heritage", mayor Nesme said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff and around 20 visitors present on the museum's ground floor had been "traumatised" by the violent intrusion, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hieron Museum, one of France's oldest for sacred art, has previously been targeted by thieves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two gold crowns were stolen in 2017, while there was another attempted robbery in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's theft came a day after several precious objects including ornate snuffboxes were stolen from a central Paris museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad daylight robbery saw thieves break into a display case with axes and baseball bats in full view of visitors and staff at the Cognacq-Jay museum. (AFP)

    COP29 draft proposes rich nations pay US$250bn a year

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new draft of a global climate agreement released on Friday at COP29 in Azerbaijan proposes that developed countries provide US$250 billion annually by 2035 to help poorer countries fight global warming.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time a concrete number has been formally proposed at the UN climate talks in Baku, and comes on the final day of a summit dominated by divisions over money.
  <br>
  <br>
  The text sets an ambitious overall target to raise a total of US$1.3 trillion a year by 2035, with the money from rich governments at the core of funding that would be coupled with private-sector investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nearly 200 nations at COP29 had struggled to agree on a new goal that boosted assistance for developing nations to cut emissions and adapt to climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing pledge committed wealthy nations most responsible historically for global warming to provide US$100 billion a year in climate finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  An influential negotiation bloc of 134 developing nations including China has demanded at least five times that figure from developed countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major contributors such as the European Union had said such demands were politically unrealistic and that private-sector money must play a large part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many countries have also pushed at COP29 for a redoubling of efforts to cut planet-heating emissions, something opposed by the Arab Group of nations which does not want fossil fuels singled out. (AFP)

    Nearly 5 tonnes of cocaine seized at Antwerp port

<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgian authorities said on Friday they had seized almost five tonnes of cocaine stashed in shipping containers at Antwerp port, as part of a cross-border investigation into a drug trafficking ring.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said eight people were detained following searches carried out in Belgium and the Netherlands earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The inspections led to the seizure of 185,000 euros (US$193,000) in cash as well as weapons, jewellery, luxury handbags, watches and 4.78 tonnes of cocaine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe focused on a criminal organisation involved in trafficking cocaine to Belgium from South America, Central America and Canada, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group allegedly facilitated the clearing of suspicious containers in the port of Antwerp and, in return for payment, provided logistical assistance to other organisations, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antwerp's port is one of the major gateways for drugs smuggled from South America to the European market, and busts in and around the vast facility occur frequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cocaine seizures there hit a record 116 tonnes last year. (AFP)
