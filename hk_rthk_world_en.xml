<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order lifting water-pressure restrictions on showerheads, a move the White House said would "make America's showers great again".
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long complained about inadequate water pressure in American bathrooms, which he blames on federal water-conservation regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In my case I like to take a nice shower, to take care of my beautiful hair," Trump said as he signed the order in the Oval Office on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to stand under the shower for 15 minutes till it gets wet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It comes out drip, drip, drip. It's ridiculous."
  <br>
  <br>
  The order directs the Energy Department to roll back "radical green" regulations limiting the flow of showerheads to 9.5 litres of water per minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the order "frees Americans from excessive regulations that turned a basic household item into a bureaucratic nightmare" and ends the "Obama-Biden war on showers".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has targeted water-pressure standards for showerheads, toilets, dishwashers and other household appliances, since his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My hair, I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect, perfect," he said outside the White House in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I take a shower, I want that beautiful head of hair to be just lathered," Trump said in Detroit in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I get this best stuff you can buy and I dump it all over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then I turn on the water and the damn water drips out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't get the stuff out of my hair. It's a horrible thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  But according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, "shower head standards save consumers money on their water and energy bills and help the environment".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Testing has repeatedly shown that today's models can provide an excellent shower," the NGO said in a 2024 report. (AFP)

    'AI surge creates new energy security challenges'

<img alt="Data centres' global electricity consumption has increased by 12 percent annually over the past five years. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799751_1_20250410130449.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Electricity consumption by data centres will more than double by 2030, driven by artificial intelligence applications that will create new challenges for energy security and CO2 emission goals, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, AI can unlock opportunities to produce and consume electricity more efficiently, the agency said in its first report on the energy implications of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data centres represented about 1.5 percent of global electricity consumption in 2024, but that has increased by 12 percent annually over the past five years. Generative AI requires colossal computing power to process information accumulated in gigantic databases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together, the United States, Europe, and China currently account for about 85 percent of data centre consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big tech companies increasingly recognise their growing need for power. Google last year signed a deal to get electricity from small nuclear reactors to help power its part in the artificial intelligence race.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the current rate, data centres will consume about three percent of global energy by 2030, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the IEA, data centre electricity consumption will reach about 945 terawatt hours by 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is slightly more than Japan's total electricity consumption today. AI is the most important driver of this growth, alongside growing demand for other digital services," said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  One 100 megawatt data centre can use as much power as 100,000 households, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it highlighted that new data centres, already under construction, could use as much as two million households. (AFP)

    S Korean opposition leader opens presidential bid

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, widely seen as the frontrunner in a presidential by-election triggered by the removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol last week, officially announced a presidential bid on Thursday, vowing to heal a starkly divided nation through economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, led the liberal Democratic Party’s campaign to oust the former president over his December declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee recently stepped down as the party’s chairman to focus on campaigning for the June 3 election. He is considered the clear frontrunner in party's primary. Kim Dong-yeon, the Democratic governor of Gyeonggi province and a longtime financial policymaker, also told reporters on Wednesday that he intends to run for president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s downfall has left the conservative People Power Party in disarray, with roughly 10 politicians expected to seek the nomination, reflecting a split between Yoon loyalists, who still control the party’s leadership, and reformists calling for a fresh start.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video message, Lee said that Yoon’s martial law saga exposed the country’s deep divisions and social conflicts, and argued that the root cause was a widening rich-poor gap. He promised aggressive government spending to jolt economic growth and ease income polarisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have more than we did in the past, but wealth is too concentrated in certain areas,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With economic growth rates declining worldwide, it has become difficult to maintain and develop an economy solely on the strength of the private sector. However, with government-led talent development and extensive investments in technological research and development, we can revive the economy.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said it was crucial to maintain a robust alliance with the United States and to pursue three-way cooperation with Japan, but he stressed that South Korea’s national interest should come first in “every decision”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who has served as a lawmaker, provincial governor and city mayor, is adored by supporters for his outspoken style and has long positioned himself as an anti-elitist.
  <br>
  <br>
  His critics view him as a populist who stokes division and demonises conservative opponents, while failing to offer realistic funding plans to achieve his ambitious goals. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dominican Republic rescue workers ended the search for survivors of a nightclub roof collapse as the death toll surpassed 180 in the Caribbean nation's worst disaster in decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel late on Wednesday reported 60 more deaths compared to the morning's count, with the total confirmed tally reaching 184.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official statement had earlier said that "all reasonable possibilities of finding more survivors" had been exhausted, and the focus of the operation will turn to recovering bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we will complete the rescue effort," said Jose Luis Frometa Herasme, head of the fire service in the Dominican capital Santo Domingo, where the tragedy ocurred at the Jet Set nightclub in the early hours of Tuesday, sending shockwaves through the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives of missing people were still waiting desperately for news on Wednesday of their loved ones outside the ruined club, at hospitals and at the local morgue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 300 rescue workers, aided by sniffer dogs, had spent two days combing through mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets, supported by firefighters from Puerto Rico and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial images of the site showed a scene resembling the aftermath of an earthquake, with a gaping hole where the roof of the club – a fixture of Santo Domingo's nightlife for half a century – had been.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 500 people were also injured when the roof caved in while renowned merengue singer Rubby Perez was performing for a crowd of hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez and two former Major League Baseball players were among the dead.
  <br>

<img alt="Mark Carney and his wife Diana Fox are targeted because of a photograph showing them with Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799735_1_20250410115043.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is leaning into his banking background as his country fights a trade war with the United States, but his financial ties have also made him a target for conspiracy theories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Incorporating tropes familiar to followers of the far-right QAnon movement, conspiratorial social media posts about the Liberal leader have surged ahead of the country's April 28 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Posts range from false claims he recited a "satanic chant" at a campaign event to AI-generated images of him in a pool with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the ideal person to be targeted here, for sure, due to his background, as well as his financial work," said Ahmed Al-Rawi, an associate professor of communications at Canada's Simon Fraser University.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before serving as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, Carney had a lucrative career as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mentioning a candidate's affiliation with the global financial elite, and particularly the World Economic Forum, has become a dog whistle for the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Conservatives have leapt to highlight Carney's connections to the annual gathering in Davos, with party leader Pierre Poilievre in January describing him as "the voice for the billionaire globalist elite that have been impoverishing the working class around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-establishment sentiment is present on the left, but Al-Rawi noted people trying to associate Carney with a supposed circle of nefarious elites were "mostly far-right players and provocateurs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many posts have zeroed in on a picture from a festival in Britain showing Carney and his wife standing next to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  This 2013 photo is authentic, but it precipitated the spread of several AI-generated images shared to emphasize a supposed link between Carney and Epstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian Digital Media Research Network found a small number of bot accounts pushed the association by replying to posts from Canadian political figures. Once larger accounts began to engage with the claims, millions of views rolled in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al-Rawi said for conspiracy theorists, a grain of truth mixed with fabricated evidence is enough for a claim to truly take hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman with the Carney campaign said the claims being spread were "false and disinformation" and said any insinuated connection with Maxwell was incorrect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She went to high school with Mark Carney's wife's sister," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although they may have bumped into each other in public settings, they are not friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts said engagement with the claims appears to be somewhat contained to groups already critical of Carney's Liberal Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carmen Celestini, an assistant professor in religious studies at the University of Waterloo, said the push appears to be building on attacks that were successful in hitting Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just sort of makes sense to move those conspiracy theories towards Carney," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls indicate that Carney's replacement of Trudeau coincided with a surge in Liberal support. (AFP)

    Lego opens US$1bn factory in Vietnam

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lego has opened a US$1 billion factory in Vietnam that it says will make toys without adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere by relying entirely on clean energy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The factory, which opened on Wednesday in an industrial area close to Ho Chi Minh City, is the first in Vietnam that aims to run entirely on clean energy. Lego says it will do that by early 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the Danish company's sixth worldwide and its second in Asia. It will use high-tech equipment to produce colourful Lego bricks for Southeast Asia’s growing markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We just want to make sure that the planet that the children inherit when they grow up needs to be a planet that is still there,” Lego CEO Niels Christiansen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The factory is an important factor in Lego's quest to stop adding greenhouse gases by 2050. It has a shorter-term target of reducing emissions by 37 percent by 2032.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privately-held group, which currently makes its bricks out of oil-based plastic, says it has invested more than US$1.2 billion in a search for more sustainable alternatives. But those efforts have not always been successful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vietnam also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, so it needs more of its factories to use clean energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country hopes the plant’s 12,400 solar panels and energy storage system will help set a precedent for more sustainable manufacturing. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has backtracked on emergency food aid cuts it announced for 14 countries, restoring assistance to six of them, the UN's World Food Program said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The UN agency, already struggling with financing woes, said on Monday that the United States advised it that Washington was eliminating emergency food aid to those 14 poor and otherwise troubled countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WFP said the cuts amounted to a "death sentence" for millions of hungry or starving people.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the United States has now reversed course and said it will continue sending food aid to Somalia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Ecuador, a WFP program official told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, with aid now cut off for the other eight countries, "hunger will deepen, millions of lives will be lost, entire regions will be destabilized," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  These eight countries are Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, Yemen, Chad, Mali, Nigeria and Madagascar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has largely gutted USAID, the main US humanitarian assistance organisation. It previously had a yearly budget of US$42.8 billion, which was 42 percent of all aid money disbursed around the world. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel said on Wednesday its troops were seizing "large areas" in Gaza and making the Palestinian territory "smaller and more isolated", as an air strike on a residential block killed at least 23 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz's comments come weeks into a renewed offensive by the military on the war-battered territory, which has displaced hundreds of thousands, while an aid blockade has revived the spectre of famine for its 2.4 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said that France plans to recognise a Palestinian state in the "coming months", a move that risks antagonising Israel which insists such moves by foreign states are premature.
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz said that "large areas are being seized and added to Israel's security zones, leaving Gaza smaller and more isolated", during a visit to the newly announced Morag Corridor between the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Yunis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz emphasised that Israel would keep increasing pressure on Gaza "until the hostages are freed and Hamas is defeated".
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz also said that Israel was encouraging plans for "voluntary emigration... in accordance with the vision of the US president, which we are working to implement".
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump had earlier this year proposed a plan to develop Gaza into a "Riviera of the Middle East" while displacing its population elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency meanwhile said an Israeli air strike on a residential building in Gaza City killed at least 23 people, most of them children or women, while the military said it targeted a "senior Hamas" militant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed intense strikes on Gaza on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. Efforts to restore the truce have so far failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said on Wednesday that at least 1,482 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed Israeli operations, taking the overall death toll since the start of the war to 50,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 2023 attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians. (AFP)

    France cuts growth forecast for 2025 on tariff fears

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The French government has cut its growth forecast for 2025 because of the uncertainty over world trade, the economy minister said on Wednesday just hours after US President Donald Trump paused a massive hike in tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government had forecast annual growth of 0.9 percent when presenting its 2025 budget, but Economy Minister Eric Lombard told TF1 television that it would be trimmed to 0.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bank of France had already revised its growth forecast for 2025 to 0.7 percent in March, and the French Economic Observatory (OFCE) lowered its forecast to 0.5 percent on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about a possible further downward revision, the minister said that "would depend on the negotiations that will be initiated with the United States and the decisions that are taken on customs duties."
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we succeed in lowering tariffs, we could even get better, and if not, we will see," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lombard ruled out raising taxes in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before his interview, Trump announced that he was suspending levies on all countries except China for three months, after US bond and equity markets had tumbled for several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's good news, but we must remain calm," Lombard told LCI television, saying he hoped to find "a new agreement" with the Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau welcomed the US move which he called "a return to economic realism and a little reality". But he warned that US policy remained "unpredictable" and that there would be a "negative impact" in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy, which exports much more to the US than France, earlier in the day halved its growth forecast for 2025 to 0.6 percent. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Relatives of people trapped under the rubble of a Dominican Republic nightclub that collapsed, killing over 120, waited anxiously for news on Wednesday as hopes of finding their loved ones alive began to fade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The disaster at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo sent shockwaves through the Caribbean nation, a major tourism destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 124 people were killed and over 500 injured when the club's roof caved in while renowned Dominican merengue singer Rubby Perez was performing for a crowd of hundreds in the early hours of Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez himself died in the calamity, as well as two former Major League Baseball players among the party-goers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of relatives gathered outside the club, hospitals and the city morgue on Wednesday, clamouring for news as forensic teams continued to identify the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 300 rescue workers continued combing through mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets, supported by firefighters from Puerto Rico and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial images of the site showed a scene resembling the aftermath of an earthquake, with a gaping hole where the club's roof had been.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Manuel Mendez, director of emergency operations, said rescue crews still had "24 to 36 hours of work left" to find survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hope is the last thing we lose," he said. (AFP)

    Trump pauses tariffs for 90 days but hits China harder

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump abruptly backed down on Wednesday in his global trade war with a 90-day pause for most countries – but slapped even more levies against China in what has become a full-scale confrontation between the world's two largest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Following days of global market turmoil, Wall Street stocks surged in reaction to Trump's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have authorized a 90-day PAUSE" on higher tariffs that took effect on Wednesday, Trump said on his Truth Social network, saying he took the decision after more than 75 countries had reached out to negotiate and did not retaliate against the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a flat rate of 10 percent tariffs on all countries that took effect on Saturday will remain in place. This marked a stunning reverse from often punishing levies that hit even many of the closest US allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump accused China of still "ripping off" his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 percent, effective immediately," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had only hours earlier ramped up the duties on Chinese goods to a giant 104 percent. China then retaliated by raising tariffs on US imports to 84 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable," Trump said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU on Wednesday adopted its first measures hitting back at US President Donald Trump's tariffs, targeting more than 20 billion euros of US products including soybeans, motorcycles and beauty products.
 <br>
  <br>
  "These countermeasures can be suspended at any time, should the US agree to a fair and balanced negotiated outcome," the European Commission said in a statement issued after EU member states greenlit the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies are retaliation for US duties on steel and aluminium imposed last month – with Europe's response to Trump's latest tariffs salvo yet to be announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duties will start to be collected under the measures on April 15, the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EU considers US tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels stressed it wanted a deal that "would be balanced and mutually beneficial".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also slapped a 25-percent tariff on car imports from the EU, and targeted the bloc with so-called reciprocal tariffs of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  An EU spokesman said its response to those measures could be unveiled as early as next week. (AFP)

 Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on a residential building in the Shujaiya area of Gaza City killed at least 20 people on Wednesday, as the military said they were looking into the attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency's spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the strike resulted in "20 martyrs and more than 40 injured" and the search for bodies in the rubble was ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed intense strikes on the Gaza Strip on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. Efforts to restore the truce have so far failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said on Wednesday that at least 1,482 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed Israeli operations, taking the overall death toll since the start of the war to 50,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  An October 2023 attack by Hamas that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hossam Badran, a member of Hamas's political bureau, said on Tuesday that it was "necessary to reach a ceasefire" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "communication with the mediators is still ongoing" but that "so far, there are no new proposals".
  <br>
  <br>
  Badran said Hamas "is open to all ideas that would lead to a ceasefire and stop the genocide enacted against our Palestinian people".
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that new negotiations were in the works aimed at getting more hostages released from captivity in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack on Israel, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. (AFP)

    Hezbollah 'ready for talks on disarmament'

<img alt="Israeli military exhibit seized Hezbollah weapons, without specifying when and where they were confiscated, near the border with Lebanon last year. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799628_1_20250409180051.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 As calls for Lebanon's Hezbollah to disarm gain momentum, a senior official from the group said it is ready to hold talks with the Lebanese president about its weapons if Israel withdraws from south Lebanon and stops its strikes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The prospect of talks aimed at securing Hezbollah's disarmament – unimaginable when it was at the zenith of its power just two years ago – underlines dramatic shifts in the Middle East power balance since Israel pummelled the Iran-backed group in a devastating conflict triggered by the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US-backed President Joseph Aoun, who vowed when he took office in January to establish a state monopoly on the control of arms, intends to open talks with Hezbollah over its arsenal soon, three Lebanese political sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hezbollah emerged severely weakened from the 2024 conflict with Israel when its top leaders and thousands of its fighters were killed and much of its rocket arsenal destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blow was compounded when its ally Bashar al-Assad was toppled from power in Syria, cutting its supply lines from Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The senior Hezbollah official said the group was ready to discuss its arms in the context of a national defence strategy but this hinged on Israel pulling out its troops from five hilltops in south Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hezbollah is ready to discuss the matter of its arms if Israel withdraws from the five points, and halts its aggression against Lebanese," the senior official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel, which sent ground troops into south Lebanon during the war, has largely withdrawn but decided in February not to leave the five hilltop positions. It said it intended eventually to hand them over to Lebanese troops once it was sure the security situation allowed. (Reuters)

 China said on Wednesday it is verifying reports of Chinese nationals being captured in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a regular briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian also urged its citizens to avoid conflict zones and participating in wars, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had captured two Chinese citizens fighting alongside Russian forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese side is verifying relevant information with the Ukrainian side," Lin said.

  Zelensky said in a social media post that two Chinese citizens were captured in the Donetsk region. (Agencies)

 China-US economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial and win-win in nature, and cooperation benefits both sides while confrontation harms both, said a white paper released by the State Council Information Office on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maintaining the stable development of China-US economic and trade relations is in the fundamental interest of both nations and peoples, which is also conducive to global economic development, according to the white paper titled "China's Position on Some Issues Concerning China-US Economic and Trade Relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of the white paper came on the same day steep US tariffs of 104 percent for Chinese goods came into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the document, Beijing and Washington can resolve differences in economic and trade areas through equal-footed dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equal-footed dialogue should constitute the fundamental approach in addressing problems between major countries, the white paper said, adding that mutually beneficial cooperation can help the two countries realise their respective development goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The white paper noted the world anticipates China-US cooperation to generate more development opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the document, the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will damage its own and others' interests, and is a severe violation of World Trade Organization rules that damages the multilateral trading system and erodes the legitimate rights and interests of the parties affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said tariffs will increase inflationary pressure in the United States, weaken its industrial base, aggravate panic in the financial market and increase the risk of US economic recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "History has repeatedly taught the lesson that trade protectionism will not help strengthen a country's domestic economy," the white paper said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, it will do severe damage to world trade and investment, which could trigger a global economic and financial crisis, with the inevitable consequences for oneself and others." (Reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US media giant Comcast Corp will build its first Universal theme park and resort in Europe in Bedford, north of London, opening in 2031, the British government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The park will create 20,000 jobs during construction and a further 8,000 jobs across the hospitality and creative industries when it opens, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is expected to attract 8.5 million visitors in its first year, a number currently only exceeded in Europe by Disneyland Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universal Studios has five resorts and parks in the US states of California and Florida as well as in Singapore, Japan and China, offering rides and attractions based on Jurassic Park, Harry Potter and other movie franchises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has sought to ease planning demands to boost investment in Britain, said in a statement the multi-billion pound investment would make Bedford home to one of the biggest entertainment parks in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plans for the site include a theme park, featuring several themed lands, a 500-room hotel and a retail, dining and entertainment complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast President Mike Cavanagh showed Starmer the plan in London on Tuesday, saying he "could not be more excited" to create a Universal theme park and resort in the heart of the United Kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast bought a 500-acre former brickworks in Bedfordshire, about 55 miles north of London, in 2023. It already owns Sky, which is Europe's biggest pay-TV business.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had been in talks with the British government since last year about turning the site into a theme park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park and resort are subject to planning permission, the government said. (Reuters)

    Trump's sweeping global tariffs take effect

<img alt="White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal over tariffs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799523_1_20250409074554.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries took effect on Wednesday, including massive 104 percent duties on Chinese goods, deepening his global trade war even as he prepared for negotiations with some nations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's punishing tariffs have shaken a global trading order that has persisted for decades, raised fears of recession and driven worldwide stocks sharply downward.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 has shed nearly US$6 trillion in value since Trump unveiled the tariffs a week ago, the deepest four-day loss since the benchmark's creation in the 1950s.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index is now nearing a bear market, defined as 20 percent below its most recent high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has made clear that country-specific tariffs of up to 50 percent would take effect at 0401 GMT as planned. Those tariffs will be especially steep for China, as Trump has ratcheted up duties on its imports to 104 percent in response to counter-tariffs Beijing announced last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to fight to the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing on Tuesday that President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal with the United States concerning additional tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese want to make a deal. They just don't know how to do it," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He believes China has to make a deal with the United States." If China reaches out, she added, Trump would be "incredibly gracious, but he's going to do what's best for the American people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country's 25 percent tariff on some vehicles - a countermeasure to match Trump's approach - would take effect immediately after midnight local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump caused this trade crisis - and Canada is responding with purpose and with force," Carney said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada and Mexico were exempt from the new round of tariffs Trump announced last week, but previous levies remained in place. Most goods that comply with the existing trade agreement between the three countries are not subject to those tariffs. (Reuters)

    Trump signs order to 'turbocharge' coal mining in US

<img alt="President Trump speaks next to coal industry workers, on the day he signs energy-related executive orders at the White House. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799521_1_20250409073316.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed executive orders to "turbocharge coal mining" in the country, seeking to "more than double" electricity production to keep up with power-hungry artificial intelligence technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  The executive orders, which Trump signed surrounded by miners in hard hats, will lift regulatory barriers to coal extraction and suspend the planned closures of numerous coal-fired power plants across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will end the government bias against coal," said the Republican, who instructed the Department of Justice to identify and fight any state or local regulations that were "putting our coal miners out of business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said that it would be "possible to extract enormous amounts of critical minerals and rare earths, which, you know, we need for technology and high technology in the process of coal mining."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lena Moffitt, director of the climate NGO Evergreen, criticised the president in a statement for using artificial intelligence as "a cover to bail out his fossil fuel donors with the dirtiest, most expensive power source on the grid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Production of coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, has fallen sharply in the United States over the last 15 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, coal accounted for just over 16 percent of total electricity production, outstripped by renewable energies at just over 21 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long been a sceptic of climate change, and since his return to the White House has set about boosting fossil fuels through deregulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, his administration announced a wave of environmental rollbacks targeting the green policies of his predecessor Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the most significant of them was revisiting a 2024 rule that requires coal-fired plants to eliminate nearly all their carbon emissions or commit to shutting down altogether, a cornerstone of Biden's climate agenda. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers raced to find survivors on Tuesday among the rubble of a Dominican Republic nightclub where at least 98 people, including a Major League Baseball star, were killed when the roof collapsed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Renowned Dominican merengue singer Rubby Perez, who was on stage at the popular Jet Set nightclub when the roof caved in shortly after midnight, was one of those caught up in the calamity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers said the 69-year-old was among dozens of people trapped in the rubble, some of whom were heard crying for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Dominican media outlets later reported that Perez had been found dead but Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Emergency Operations Centre, said forensics experts had "not confirmed that they found the body."
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 370 rescue personnel combed mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets for survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the dead was 51-year-old retired MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel, who won a World Series in 2011 with the St Louis Cardinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was rescued alive but died of his injuries while being taken to hospital, local media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media said there were between 500 and 1,000 people in the club when disaster struck shortly at 12:44 am local time. The club has capacity for 700 people seated and about 1,000 people standing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of ambulances ferried the injured to hospital, as scores of people gathered outside the venue desperately seeking news of their loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez was on stage when there was a blackout and the roof came crashing down, according to eyewitness reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also among the dead was the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, according to President Luis Abinader.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll started at 15 and kept rising throughout the day. By evening it had reached 66.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Abinader visited the scene and declared three days of national mourning. (AFP)

<img alt="Antonio Guterres also raised the alarm about the situation in the West Bank. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799501_1_20250409013523.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday that Gaza had become "a killing field," blaming Israel for blocking aid and failing in its "unequivocal obligations" to meet the needs of the Palestinian territory's residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  "More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. No commercial supplies. As aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have reopened," Guterres said in remarks to journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pointing to the Geneva Conventions governing the treatment of people in war, he emphasised the obligation of the "occupying power" to ensure the provision of food and medical supplies to the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "None of that is happening today. No humanitarian supplies can enter Gaza," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Israeli authorities newly proposed 'authorisation mechanisms' for aid delivery risk further controlling and callously limiting aid down to the last calorie and grain of flour," Guterres told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referencing recent Israeli proposals over controlling aid into Gaza, which a UN source said included monitoring calories to prevent misuse by Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let me be clear – we will not participate in any arrangement that does not fully respect the humanitarian principles – humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality," he said, demanding guarantees for the unhindered entry of aid to the coastal territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guterres also raised the alarm about the situation in the West Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The current path is a dead end – totally intolerable in the eyes of international law and history," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the risk of the occupied West Bank transforming into another Gaza makes it even worse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is time to end the dehumanisation, protect civilians, release the hostages, ensure lifesaving aid, and renew the ceasefire." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk on Tuesday described Peter Navarro, a senior White House trade adviser, as "truly a moron" in a growing rift over Donald Trump's tariff policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk, a key aide to the president, has signalled his opposition to the tariffs, and the Tesla CEO hit out after Navarro described his electric vehicle company as "not a car manufacturer" but "a car assembler."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's new tariffs on imports have roiled markets as fears of a global recession rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk posted his criticism on X under a clip of Navarro saying Tesla imported batteries, electronics and tyres, and that Musk "wants the cheap foreign parts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk fired back, saying that "Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man recently backed a free-trade zone between North America and Europe – a wish at odds with Trump's flagship tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has ruled out any pause in his aggressive stance despite retaliatory action from China and signs of criticism from within his Republican Party. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers were on Tuesday racing to find survivers among the rubble of a Dominican Republic night club where at least 18 people died and dozens were hurt in an early-morning roof collapse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 400 rescue personnel were at the Jet Set nightclub in the Caribbean nation's capital Santo Domingo, authorities said, with dozens of ambulances on standby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media said there were between 500 and 1,000 people in the club when the roof came down following a sudden blackout during a performance by renowned merengue singer Rubby Perez, who was also trapped in the rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the dead was the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, who died of her injuries in hospital, according to President Luis Abinader.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have 18 dead; we continue working with the various institutions that are part of the national emergency center," Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Emergency Operations Center (COE), told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mendez said rescuers could hear people in the rubble crying out for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there have been 121 trips to hospital with between "two and three" injured people per ambulance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as there is hope for life, all authorities will be working to recover or rescue these people," Mendez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez's daughter Zulinka said the singer, 69, was still at the scene of the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know if they have him in an ambulance because they're not letting me through."
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media published images of a construction crane at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are rescuing all the people we can save alive and recovering those bodies we find along the way. But we have focused on people we can rescue alive because we hear them asking for help," Mendez said of the ongoing operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abinader said on X the government has "been following the case minute by minute since it happened," before rushing to the scene himself.
  <br>

    Singapore PM says tariffs 'not act of a friend'

 US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Singapore are "not actions one does to a friend", the city-state's leader said on Tuesday, adding the government will likely downgrade this year's economic growth forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Lawrence Wong warned that the "likelihood of a full-blown global trade war is growing" and urged his trade-reliant nation to prepare for difficult times ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very disappointed by the US move, especially considering the deep and long-standing friendship between our two countries," he said in an address to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are not actions one does to a friend."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore was hit with a 10 percent tariff despite a free-trade agreement with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rate is much less than those imposed on other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said the trade-dependent nation will be particularly hurt by a slump in the world economy and the unravelling of the global trading system based on free trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Singapore may or may not go into recession this year, but I have no doubt that our growth will be significantly impacted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trade ministry is reassessing its economic growth forecast this year of 1 to 3 percent "and will likely revise it downwards," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said that under the US-Singapore FTA, the city-state imposes zero tariffs on American goods. Singapore also runs a trade deficit with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the tariffs were truly reciprocal and if they were meant to target only those with trade surpluses, then the tariff for Singapore should be zero," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore hosts thousands of US companies and many of them have made the city their Asia-Pacific headquarters.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the island-nation is not a US defence treaty ally, it enjoys robust military ties with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This marks a profound turning point," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are entering a new phase in global affairs, one that is more arbitrary, protectionist and dangerous." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday condemned US Vice President JD Vance as "ignorant and impolite", after he referred to Washington borrowing money from "Chinese peasants".
 <br>
  <br>
  "China's position on China-US economic and trade relations has been made very clear," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is surprising and sad to hear such ignorant and impolite words from this vice president," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has upended the world economy with sweeping tariffs that have raised the spectre of an international recession but ruled out any pause in his aggressive trade policy despite a dramatic market sell-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, Vance defended those tariffs as an antidote to a "globalist economy" that he said had not worked for ordinary Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture," the vice president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is not a recipe for economic prosperity. It's not a recipe for low prices, and it's not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump believes the tariffs will revive America's lost manufacturing base by forcing foreign companies to relocate to the United States, rather than making goods abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But most economists question that and say his tariffs are arbitrary. (AFP)

    Kennedy gets teeth into ending US fluoridation

<img alt="Robert F Kennedy says a task force of health experts will study the issue of fluoride in water and make new recommendations. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799385_1_20250408113219.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy said on Monday he’s assembling a task force of health experts to study the issue and make new recommendations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Monday, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing “new scientific information" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water. The EPA sets the maximum level allowed in public water systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy was speaking after a news conference with EPA administrator Lee Zeldin in Salt Lake City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy cannot order communities to stop fluoridation, but he can direct the CDC to stop recommending it and work with the EPA to change the allowed amount.
  <br>
  <br>
  Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican governor Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their drinking water. Water systems across the state must stop fluoridation by May 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opponents say the law will hurt residents who can’t afford regular dentist visits and may rely on public drinking water containing fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy oversees the CDC, whose recommendations are widely followed but not mandatory.
  <br>
  <br>
  State and local governments decide whether to add fluoride to water and, if so, how much – as long as it doesn’t exceed a maximum set by the EPA, which is currently four milligrams per liter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 they set guidelines for how much should be added to water.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” and said it has been associated with arthritis, bone breaks and thyroid disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn. (AP)

    World temps near record highs in March: scientists

<img alt="The Copernicus Climate Change Service said Europe saw the hottest March ever recorded. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799381_1_20250408111344.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global temperatures hovered at historic highs in March, Europe's climate monitor said on Tuesday, prolonging an extraordinary heat streak that has tested scientific expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, it was the hottest March ever recorded by a significant margin, said the Copernicus Climate Change Service, driving rainfall extremes across a continent warming faster than any other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world, meanwhile, saw the second-hottest March in the Copernicus dataset, sustaining a near-unbroken spell of record or near-record-breaking temperatures that has persisted since July 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, virtually every month has been at least 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than it was before the industrial revolution when humanity began burning massive amounts of coal, oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  March was 1.6C above pre-industrial times, prolonging an anomaly so extreme that scientists are still trying to fully explain it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That we're still at 1.6C above pre-industrial is indeed remarkable," said Friederike Otto of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists warn that every fraction of a degree of global warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate change is not just about rising temperatures but the knock-on effect of all that extra heat being trapped in the atmosphere and seas by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warmer seas mean higher evaporation and greater moisture in the atmosphere, causing heavier deluges and feeding energy into cyclones, but also affecting global rainfall patterns.
  <br>
  <br>
  March in Europe was 0.26C above the previous hottest record for the month set in 2014, Copernicus said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also "a month with contrasting rainfall extremes" across the continent, said Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs the Copernicus climate monitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some parts of Europe experienced their "driest March on record and others their wettest" for about half a century, Burgess said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere in March, scientists said that climate change intensified an extreme heatwave across Central Asia and fuelled conditions for extreme rainfall which killed 16 people in Argentina.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spectacular surge in global heat pushed 2023 and then 2024 to become the hottest years on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year was also the first full calendar year to exceed 1.5C: the safer warming limit agreed by most nations under the Paris climate accord.
  <br>
  <br>
  This represented a temporary, not permanent breach, of this longer-term target, but scientists have warned that the goal of keeping temperatures below that threshold is slipping further out of reach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists had expected that the extraordinary heat spell would subside after a warming El Nino event peaked in early 2024, and conditions gradually shifted to a cooling La Nina phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  But global temperatures have remained stubbornly high, sparking debate among scientists about what other factors could be driving warming to the top end of expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say the current period is likely the warmest the Earth has been for the last 125,000 years. (AFP)

    Seoul confirms June 3 date for presidential elections

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea will hold a presidential election on June 3, the country's acting president said on Tuesday, after Seoul's former leader Yoon Suk-yeol was removed from office over a disastrous declaration of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has been effectively leaderless since December, when former president Yoon attempted to subvert civilian rule but was quickly impeached by lawmakers and suspended from office.
  <br>
  <br>
  A court last week upheld his impeachment, stripping him of the top job, and triggering fresh elections, which must be held within 60 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had held "discussions with the National Election Commission and other related agencies", Acting President and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also took into account "the need to ensure smooth election operations and allow sufficient time for political parties to prepare," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result they have decided "to set June 3 as the date for South Korea's 21st presidential election," he said, adding that the day would be designated as a temporary public holiday to facilitate voting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han called upon ministries and the National Election Commission to "make thorough preparations to ensure an election that is fairer and more transparent than ever, and one that can earn the trust of the people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike a regular poll, where a president-elect has a two-month transition period, the winner of the June 3 election will be inaugurated the following day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han resumed acting as president recently after the Constitutional Court threw out his own impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Presidential elections are typically held on Wednesdays, but no specific weekday is required for snap polls triggered by a vacancy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official campaign period will run from May 12 until June 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is the frontrunner in any polls, with a 34 percent support rating according to the latest Gallup poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  His party already controls the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election but staged a political comeback as leader of the main opposition, despite a career shadowed by legal troubles, including ongoing trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  In distant second place is Labour Minister Kim Moon-soo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polling around nine percent, he leads a pack of challengers from Yoon's People Power Party, which also includes former party chief Han Dong-hoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also faces a separate criminal trial on charges of insurrection over the martial law bid. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has ended emergency food aid for 14 countries, endangering the lives of millions of hungry or starving people, a United Nations agency said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World Food Program (WFP), which was already grappling with a 40 percent drop in funding for this year, said  on Monday it had been advised of the new American aid halt to 14 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  In comments on X, the agency did not name these countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If implemented, this could amount to a death sentence for millions of people facing extreme hunger and starvation," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WFP is not the only UN body hit by US funding cuts, as the United States under President Donald Trump turns sharply inward and stops trying to help other countries around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration told the UN Population Fund, an agency dedicated to promoting sexual and reproductive health, that it was ending two programs, the organisation told AFP on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of programs was for Afghanistan, while the other involved Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other countries besides the United States have also announced funding cuts in recent months, causing alarm among NGOs and international organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has largely gutted USAID, the main US humanitarian assistance organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  It previously had a yearly budget of US$42.8 billion, which was 42 percent of all aid money disbursed around the world. (AFP)

    Tokyo's Nikkei up 5.8pc as US tariffs fuel volatility

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tokyo's Nikkei index jumped nearly six percent in early trade on Tuesday after plunging 7.8 percent the previous day, as US tariffs fuel market volatility.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 5.81 percent, or 1,809 points, to 32,946, while the broader Topix index gained 6.2 percent, or 141 points, to 2,430.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's Kospi index was also up nearly two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump upended the world economy last week with sweeping tariffs that have raised fears of an international recession and triggered criticism even from within his own Republican Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, stock markets and oil prices collapsed further, as trading floors across the world endured waves of selling after last week's sharp losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump doubled down on his crusade on Monday, saying he was "not looking" at any pause in tariff implementation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But meanwhile "Nvidia's stabilisation and the 2.7 percent rise in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) are expected to trigger buybacks in Japan's high-priced, semiconductor-heavy stocks", brokerage house Monex said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the yen's continued weakness providing additional tailwinds, domestic markets are projected to open higher today," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One US dollar bought 147.56 yen in morning trade, compared to 147.83 yen overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both the US administration and President Trump himself are denying reports about the suspension of reciprocal tariffs, meaning concerns over tariffs still persist," Monex said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, meanwhile, said late on Monday that he had a call with Donald Trump in which they agreed to more talks on the US president's latest tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the agreement, "tariff-related volatility will likely continue", Monex added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A volcano in the central Philippines erupted early on Tuesday morning, sending a plume of ash 4,000 metres into the sky and prompting calls for local school cancellations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kanlaon Volcano, one of 24 active volcanoes in the Southeast Asian nation, erupted in December, prompting the evacuation of surrounding villages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area around the volcano on the island of Negros was still under evacuation orders when Tuesday's eruption occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An explosive eruption is currently occurring at the summit vent of Kanlaon Volcano that began at 5:51 am today," the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcano "is producing a voluminous bent plume approximately 4,000 metres tall that is drifting southwest", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted on social media showed a wide, billowing plume of smoke slowly stretching into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  The level three alert - out of a scale of five - put in place during December's eruption remained unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, hundreds of nearby residents were evacuated after the volcano spurted thousands of tonnes of harmful gases in a single day. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said the United States was starting direct, high-level talks with Iran over its nuclear programme on Saturday, in an announcement during a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said he was hopeful of reaching a deal with Tehran, but warned that the Islamic republic would be in "great danger" if the talks failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours later Tehran confirmed discussions were set for Saturday in Oman, but stressed they were "indirect" talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Iran and the United States will meet in Oman on Saturday for indirect high-level talks," Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is as much an opportunity as it is a test," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ball is in America's court."
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu meanwhile said the United States and Israel were working on another deal to free hostages from war-torn Gaza, where a ceasefire between Israel and Iran's ally Hamas has collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're dealing with the Iranians, we have a very big meeting on Saturday and we're dealing with them directly," Trump told reporters after a meeting that was meant to focus on Israel's bid to avoid US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump did not say where the talks would take place, but insisted they would not involve surrogates and would be at "almost the highest level."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's stunning announcement came a day after Iran dismissed direct negotiations on a new deal to curb the country's nuclear programme, calling the idea pointless.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president pulled out of the last deal in 2018, during his first presidency, and there has been widespread speculation that Israel, possibly with US help, might attack Iranian facilities if no new agreement is reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump issued a stern warning to Tehran, however.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think if the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran's going to be in great danger, and I hate to say it, great danger, because they can't have a nuclear weapon," he said. (AFP)

    Supreme Court backs Trump over Alien Enemies Act

<img alt="US President Donald Trump has used the law to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799334_1_20250408075344.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court handed Donald Trump a victory on Monday by letting him use a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members as part of the Republican president's hardline approach to immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  The court granted the administration's request to lift Washington-based US Judge James Boasberg's March 15 order that had temporarily blocked the summary deportations under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act while litigation in the case continues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act on March 15 to swiftly deport the alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, attempting to speed up removals with a law best known for its use to intern Japanese, Italian and German immigrants during World War Two.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a legal challenge handled by the American Civil Liberties Union, a group of Venezuelan men in the custody of US immigration authorities on the same day sued on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, seeking to block the deportations. They argued, among other things, that Trump's order exceeded his powers because the Alien Enemies Act authorises removals only when war has been declared or the United States has been invaded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Alien Enemies Act authorises the president to deport, detain or place restrictions on individuals whose primary allegiance is to a foreign power and who might pose a national security risk in wartime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boasberg, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, temporarily blocked the deportations. But Trump's administration allowed two planes already in the air to continue to El Salvador where American officials handed 238 Venezuelan men over to Salvadoran authorities to be placed in the Central American country's "Terrorism Confinement Center."
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge also has scrutinized whether the Trump administration violated his order by failing to return the deportation flights after his order was issued. Justice Department lawyers said the flights had left US airspace by the time Boasberg issued a written order and thus were not required to return. They dismissed the weight of Boasberg's spoken order during a hearing two hours earlier calling for any planes carrying deportees to be turned around.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's administration has argued that Boasberg's temporary ban encroached on presidential authority to make national security decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On March 18, Trump called for Boasberg's impeachment by Congress - a process that could remove him from the bench - drawing a rebuke from the US Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump on social media called Boasberg, who was confirmed by the US Senate in 2011 in a bipartisan 96-0 vote, a "Radical Left Lunatic" and a "troublemaker and agitator."
  <br>
  <br>
  The DC Circuit upheld Boasberg's order after holding a contentious hearing that involved heated language. Judge Patricia Millett told Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign that "Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here." Ensign responded, "We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Family members of many of the deported Venezuelan migrants deny the alleged gang ties. Lawyers for one of the deportees, a Venezuelan professional soccer player and youth coach, said US officials had wrongly labelled him a gang member based on a tattoo of a crown meant to honour his favourite team, Real Madrid.

    Trump threatens further 50pc tariffs on China

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened huge additional tariffs on imports from China, raising the possibility of further escalation in a trade war that has already wiped trillions of dollars from global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  "If China does not withdraw its 34 percent increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50 percent, effective April 9th," Trump said in a Truth Social post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Trump put an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods, on top of two rounds of 10 percent tariffs already declared in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is not immediately clear how Trump's new threat factors into this calculation.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's response included export controls on rare earth elements, and Beijing plans for its own 34 percent tariff on US goods, stacking atop existing Chinese levies set to begin April 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said the new tariffs harmed the stability of global production and supply chains and seriously impacted the world’s economic recovery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Pressure and threats are not the way to deal with China. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” Lin told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took aim at Beijing's economic practices on social media Monday, criticising its "non-monetary tariffs" and "illegal subsidization of companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated."
  <br>
  <br>
  But "negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. (Agencies)

    Britain may close hundreds of quangos to cut costs

<img alt="Quangos, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organizations, will be reviewed with a view to closing or merging them or bringing their functions back into government departments.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain said it could close hundreds of arms-length government agencies, as it looks to reform the state to cut costs and improve productivity in what it called "a new era of global instability".
 <br>
  <br>
  Britain has hundreds of quangos, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  These are taxpayer-funded but not controlled by ministers, and include public bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive, Network Rail and the Migration Advisory Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every quango across government will be reviewed, with a view to close, merge or bring functions back into [government] departments if its continued existence cannot be justified," the government said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain is in belt-tightening mode as finance minister Rachel Reeves tries to meet her fiscal rules while also dealing with the fallout from US President Donald Trump's tariffs that have cut economic growth forecasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government warned that global instability meant it had to go "further and faster" in its reforms of the bureaucracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was scrapping NHS England, a body overseeing the health system, and bring its functions back into the government's health department, aiming to save hundreds of millions of pounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some quangos would remain unaffected by the reforms, such as those which scrutinise government or protect the rule of law, the government said. (Reuters)

    Trump calls tariffs havoc 'medicine'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump warned foreign governments they would have to pay "a lot of money" to lift sweeping tariffs, characterising the duties as "medicine" and triggering further carnage across global financial markets on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump indicated he was not concerned about losses that have already wiped out trillions of dollars in value from equity markets around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want anything to go down," he said as he returned from a weekend of golf in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had spoken to leaders from Europe and Asia over the weekend, who hope to convince him to lower tariffs as high as 50 percent due to take effect this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are coming to the table," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They want to talk but there's no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's barrage of tariffs announced last week was met with bewildered condemnation from other leaders and triggered retaliatory levies from China, the world's No 2 economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump's run for president, called for the tariffs to be paused to avert an "economic nuclear war".
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors and political leaders have struggled to determine whether Trump's tariffs are part of a permanent new regime or a negotiating tactic to win concessions from other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday morning talk shows, Trump's top economic advisers sought to portray the tariffs as a savvy repositioning of the United States in the global trade order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said more than 50 nations had started negotiations with the United States since Wednesday's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the tariffs would remain in place "for days and weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan, one of Washington's closest allies in Asia, is among countries hoping to strike some deal but its leader Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday results "won't come overnight". (Reuters)

    Trial looms for Boeing over 737 MAX crash in Eithiopia

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing is poised to face a jury trial from Monday over the fatal 2019 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX plane, the first civil case related to the disaster to reach court.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chicago trial, expected to last two weeks, was to feature two plaintiffs who lost family members in the calamity.
  <br>
  <br>
  But one of the complaints was resolved in an out-of-court settlement late on Sunday, a judicial source said, in line with most earlier litigants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barring another last-minute settlement, the trial will begin on Monday with the selection of an eight-person jury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have had some ongoing discussion that may continue throughout the day and the ensuing days," Robert Clifford, who represents relatives of several crash victims, told the US District court on Wednesday at a pre-trial hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A deal could also be struck even while the trial is underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing plane crashed on March 10, 2019, just six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa on its way to Kenya, killing all 157 people on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives of 155 of the victims had sued Boeing between April 2019 and March 2021 for wrongful death, negligence and other charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of late last month, there were 18 complaints still open against Boeing, a source familiar with the case told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday's deal meant that a further three cases had been settled since then, multiple judicial sources told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week's Chicago litigation will now examine only the case of Canadian Darcy Belanger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belanger, 46, who lived in Colorado, was a founding member of environmental NGO, the Parvati Foundation, and also worked in construction. He had been visiting Nairobi for a UN conference.(AFP)

 Impeached Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte has returned home after nearly a month at her father's side in The Hague, where he is facing a charge of crimes against humanity, her communications team said Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "My job here is done," she said ahead of her departure, saying former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's legal team was now set and she had filed the "last document" needed at the International Criminal Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president added the family no longer intends to seek financial aid to pay for her father's defence. "If we need to [sell] things to support our financial needs, we will do that," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Duterte was arrested on March 11 and whisked away the same day to the Netherlands-based tribunal to face charges tied to his drug war, in which thousands of mostly poor men were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daughter Sara followed him to The Hague immediately after and had been coordinating his legal affairs and acting as his mouthpiece, holding a number of press conferences outside the court building.
  <br>
  <br>
  She landed at Manila's international airport on Sunday night, according to her communications team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president returns as her family's PDP Laban party is lagging in polls ahead of May mid-term elections that will determine 12 Senate seats and thousands of smaller positions across the archipelago nation of 117 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Duterte clan is embroiled in a bitter feud with President Ferdinand Marcos, a one-time ally and Sara's running mate in the 2022 presidential campaign, which they won in a landslide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte was impeached by the House of Representatives in early February for "violation of the constitution, betrayal of public trust, graft and corruption, and other high crimes".
  <br>
  <br>
  Her Senate trial is set to take place following the May 12 mid-term election, the results of which will determine who serves as her jurors.
  <br>
  <br>
  If convicted, the vice president would be barred from holding public office. (AFP)

    Seoul to set presidential election for June 3: Yonhap

<img alt="People attended a rally to celebrate the expulsion of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul on Saturday. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799191_1_20250407101114.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's cabinet is expected to finalise a June 3 date for a presidential election following the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol last week for his short-lived martial law declaration, Yonhap news said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Although not required by law, the cabinet will make the decision at a meeting on Tuesday, as it needs to approve a holiday for the event, Yonhap cited an unidentified government official as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's correspondent in Seoul, Frank Smith, said Lee Jae-myung, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), was considered the frontrunner in a new election, having lost to Yoon in 2022 by a margin of less than one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's widely favoured. He's got something like a margin of 34 percent approval to nine percent for the second candidate of the Conservative bloc. So he's looking pretty good. He does have some legal problems, however, that could affect his campaign and possibly even prevent him from running, although he cleared a hurdle in that regard about two weeks ago," said Smith.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was removed by the Constitutional Court on grounds of having violated his official duty by issuing the martial law decree on December 3 and mobilising troops to halt parliamentary proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law requires a new presidential election within 60 days if the incumbent dies or is removed from office.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official of the National Election Commission said the date mentioned in media reports was not final and would not become official until declared by the acting president, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith said he did not think Yoon's removal would be the end of the current political crisis in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "South Korea has some serious political divisions that really bubbled to the surface over the past four months. Those are going to remain here. For Yoon, on the legal front, the impeachment is just one aspect of this. He still has a criminal trial to go. His lawyers prioritised the impeachment trial and kind of set aside the criminal trial as much as possible... So he has some pretty serious charges of insurrection to face, again, looking at a long prison sentence and perhaps even a death penalty, although most people suggest that's quite unlikely."

 A medical transport helicopter carrying a patient fell into the sea in southwestern Japan Sunday, leaving three of the six people aboard dead, the Japan coast guard said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pilot, Hiroshi Hamada, 66; Kazuto Yoshitake, a helicopter mechanic and a 28-year-old nurse, Sakura Kunitake, were rescued by the coast guard earlier in the day after they were found in the waters clinging to inflatable lifesavers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three suffered hypothermia, as their body temperatures dropped abnormally, but were conscious, an official with the coast guard told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies of medical doctor, Kei Arakawa, 34; Mitsuki Motoishi, 86, the patient, and her caretaker Kazuyoshi Motoishi, 68, were later recovered by a Japan Air Self-Defense Force helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their hearts had stopped, and they were later confirmed dead by a physician.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coast guard deployed two planes and three ships to the area as part of the rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six people were aboard what the Japanese call “a doctor helicopter,” on their way to a hospital in Fukuoka from an airport in Nagasaki Prefecture, when it crashed, according to the coast guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the accident remains under investigation, the coast guard said Monday. (AP)

    Nikkei plunges on Trump tariff concerns

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Nikkei share index plunged further on Monday, as US futures pointed to additional losses on Wall Street over President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  In early trade in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 was off 7.35 percent, adding to a 2.75-percent drop on Friday, while in Seoul the Kospi was off 4.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's stock index plummeted 6 percent at the open on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday that the government would continue to ask President Trump to lower tariffs against Japan, but acknowledged results "won't come overnight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As such, the government must take all available means" to cushion the economic blow from US tariffs, such as offering funding support for domestic firms and taking measures to protect jobs, Ishiba told parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba said Trump's decision to slap tariffs on imports from Japan was "extremely disappointing and regrettable," adding that Japan would continue to explain that it had done nothing unfair to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba also said he was willing to visit the United States for a meeting with Trump as soon as possible. "But in doing so, we must ready a package of steps on what Japan could do," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's decision to slap a 25 percent levy on auto imports, and a reciprocal 24 percent tariff on other Japanese goods, is expected to deal a huge blow to Japan's export-heavy economy with analysts predicting the higher duties could knock up to 0.8 percent off economic growth. (Agencies)

    Second US child dies of measles, almost 650 ill

<div class="itemFullText">
 A measles outbreak has killed a second child in the southwestern United States, authorities said on Sunday, with almost 650 people now infected as the highly-contagious disease spreads.
 <br>
  <br>
  The school-aged child, who was unvaccinated and had no underlying health conditions, died on Thursday in the hospital from measles pulmonary failure, the Texas Department of State Health Services said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalised," Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, Texas, said in an email.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the second death of a child in Texas since the measles outbreak began in late January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, in a post on X, identified the child as eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy, who has been an anti-vaccine advocate and previously has said vaccination is a personal choice, on Sunday said vaccines are the best protection against measles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine," he said in the post on X. He said that as of Sunday there are 642 confirmed cases of measles, 499 of those in Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded cases stretching from Alaska to Florida, as well as in New York City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Texas had reported its first measles death, also of a child, in late February - marking the first US fatality from the disease in nearly a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death of a New Mexico adult last month was also classified by the CDC as a measles-related fatality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of measles cases tallied by the CDC - 97 percent - are patients not vaccinated against the measles, it said on April 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measles vaccine is 97 percent effective after two shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paediatricians and other doctors are pushing back against vaccine hesitancy and warning parents that vitamin A and other supplements touted by vaccine critics will not protect their children from the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease. (Agencies)

    World scrambles to temper Trump tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 50 countries have sought talks with President Donald Trump in a scramble to ease punishing tariffs on exports to the United States, the White House said on Sunday, as trade partners braced for fallout.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has remained defiant since unleashing the blitz of levies on stunned countries around the world on Wednesday, insisting that his policies "will never change" even as markets went into a tailspin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But his staggered deadlines have left space for some countries to negotiate, even as he insisted he would stand firm and his administration warned against any retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation," Kevin Hassett, head of the White House National Economic Council, told CNN on Sunday, citing the US Trade Representative.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they were doing so "because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariffs," as the administration continues to insist that the duties would not lead to major price rises in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think that you're going to see a big effect on the consumer in the US," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also told NBC's Meet the Press that 50 countries had reached out.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as for whether Trump will negotiate with them, "I think that's a decision for President Trump," Bessent said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this moment he's created maximum leverage for himself... I think we're going to have to see what the countries offer, and whether it's believable," Bessent said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other countries have been "bad actors for a long time, and it's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks," he claimed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long insisted that countries around the world that sell products to the United States are in fact ripping Americans off, and he sees tariffs as a means to right that wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  But many economists have warned that tariffs are passed on to consumers and that they could see price rises at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, the uncertainty over trade and manufacturing has helped fuel a days-long panic in global markets. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Palestinian official told AFP that Israeli forces shot dead a teenager holding US citizenship in the occupied West Bank Sunday, while the Israeli military said it had killed a "terrorist" who threw rocks at cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Omar Muhammad Saadeh Rabee, a 14-year-old "who was killed in Turmus Ayya, held US citizenship," the town's mayor, Lafi Shalabi, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said that during "counter-terrorism activity" in Turmus Ayya, "soldiers identified three terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The soldiers opened fire toward the terrorists who were endangering civilians, eliminating one terrorist and hitting two additional terrorists," a military statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian health ministry said one person was in critical condition and another suffered minor injuries in the same incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shalabi said one of the wounded also had US citizenship. And Turmus Ayya, northest of the main West Bank city of Ramallah, is known for having many dual US-Palestinian citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestine Red Crescent said its teams had taken the body of the deceased boy to a hospital. It also reported the injuries of two boys shot in the lower abdomen and thigh respectively, during "clashes" in Turmus Ayya.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the two, 14-year-old Abdul Rahman Shehadeh, told AFP he was shot by a soldier while collecting fruit near the town.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second, who was shot in the abdomen, was identified as 14-year-old Ayoub Asaad by his father Ahed Asaad. He confirmed that the boy had a US passport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahed Assad said that an ambulance that took his wounded son to hospital was stopped by soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were stopped at a military checkpoint at the village entrance, and a soldier told me that he was the one who shot the three boys," he told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Authority's foreign affairs ministry denounced the Israeli forces' "use of live fire against three children".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel's continued impunity as an illegal occupying power encourages it to commit further crimes", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violence has soared in the West Bank since the Gaza war started on October 7, 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 918 Palestinians, including militants, in the West Bank since then, according to Palestinian health ministry figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian attacks and clashes during military raids have killed at least 33 Israelis, including soldiers, over the same period, according to official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has occupied the West Bank, home to about three million Palestinians, since 1967. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Marine Le Pen on Sunday invoked Martin Luther King's struggle for civil rights as her far-right party planned to rally its supporters after she was convicted of embezzlement and banned from public office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The bombshell judgement that could crush Le Pen's dream of winning the French presidency in 2027 has stunned the country's political establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some leftwing forces and the centrist camp staged counter gatherings on Sunday against the far right, while the judges who convicted Le Pen have received threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, ahead of the rally, Le Pen urged her supporters to take inspiration from one of America's pre-eminent advocates of nonviolence in the fight for equal rights for black Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will follow the example of Martin Luther King, who defended civil rights," she told members of Italy's hard-right League party, who were meeting in Florence, via video-link.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you, Marine, we don't want to take up any more of your time," said Italian deputy prime minister, League leader Matteo Salvini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today will be an important day for you, for France," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a meeting of President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party in the northern working-class Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, former prime minister Gabriel Attal accused the far right of "attacking our judges, attacking our institutions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We, here, will never disqualify a court decision," said 36-year-old Attal, speaking in the presence of Prime Minister Francois Bayrou and fellow former premier Edouard Philippe, who also hopes to run in the 2027 presidential elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Le Pen, 56, was found guilty of embezzling European Parliament funds and given a partly suspended jail term and an immediate ban on holding public office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her supporters branded the ruling politically motivated, but Macron insisted the French judiciary is "independent".
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump called the sentence a "witch hunt" by "European leftists using lawfare to silence free speech, and censor their political opponent".
  <br>
  <br>
  Some left-wingers including members of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party staged a counter rally in Place de la Republique which attracted several hundred people. (AFP)

 Pope Francis, who is recovering after a serious case of pneumonia, made a surprise public appearance on Sunday as he mingled with crowds at the Vatican just two weeks after leaving hospital.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A good Sunday to all. Thank you very much", the 88-year old Pope said as he was wheeled through Saint Peter's Square in his wheelchair after a mass dedicated to the sick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Surrounded by a mass of smartphones and cameras, and attached to nasal breathing tubes, his voice was fragile but more audible than when he left the Gemelli hospital on March 23. His last public appearance was February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis is, in theory, undergoing two months of convalescence following his life-threatening health scare, with strict rest, no public activity and no contact with crowds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it was "unacceptable" and deeply concerning that Israel had detained two UK lawmakers and denied them entry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, from the governing Labour Party, flew from London to Israel but were blocked from entering the country and deported, British media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning that two British MPs on a parliamentary delegation to Israel have been detained and refused entry by the Israeli authorities," Lammy said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians, and we have been in contact with both MPs tonight to offer our support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The UK government's focus remains securing a return to the ceasefire and negotiations to stop the bloodshed, free the hostages and end the conflict in Gaza."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since renewed military operations last month ended a short-lived truce in its war with Hamas, Israel has pushed to seize territory in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in Gaza said 1,249 people have been killed since Israel resumed intense bombing last month, bringing the overall death toll since the war began to 50,609. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rain was compounding misery and presenting new hurdles for relief efforts on Sunday in Myanmar, where state media reported the death toll from a devastating earthquake had risen to nearly 3,500 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7-magnitude quake struck on March 28, razing buildings, cutting off power and destroying bridges and roads across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damage has been particularly severe in the city of Sagaing near the epicentre, as well as in Mandalay, Myanmar's second city and home to more than 1.7 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media in the military junta-led country on Sunday said the earthquake caused 3,471 confirmed deaths and injured 4,671 people, while 214 remained missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  With people either having lost their homes entirely or reluctant to spend time in cracked and unstable structures, many Mandalay residents have been sleeping outside in tents.
  <br>
  <br>
  When wind and rain began battering the rudimentary shelters on Saturday evening, victims were forced to choose between passing the night in dry but risky buildings or outdoors in the elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People are trying to rebuild their lives now," said United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher in a video filmed in Mandalay, posted to X on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They need food. They need water. They need the power back on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many people in the area are still without shelter, he said, describing the scale of damage in the area as "epic".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to get tents and hope to survivors as they rebuild their shattered lives," Fletcher wrote in another post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid experts warn that rainy conditions and scorching heat increase the risk of disease outbreaks at outdoor camps where victims were in temporary shelter. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump told Americans on Saturday to “hang tough” in the face of economic turmoil caused by sweeping tariffs introduced on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a post on his Truth Social site, the US President promised “historic” results from what he called an “economic revolution”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alarm about the fallout of Wednesday’s tariff announcement has gripped global financial markets, with Wall Street's fear level at a five-year high while financial executives expressed shock and worry about economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trillions were wiped off stock market values as investors said they were fearful about the risk of recession ahead. US stock markets slumped more than 10 percent in two days, with the Nasdaq Composite now in a bear market, as China imposed fresh tariffs on all US goods, sparking worries of an extended global trade war.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Billionaire US presidential adviser Elon Musk said on Saturday he hoped Europe and the United States would agree to join in a free-trade zone after US leader Donald Trump unleashed heavy global trade tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's sweeping tariffs announced earlier this week sent global stocks tumbling, worried allies, and raised the prospect of others – possibly the European Union – raising tariffs themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU, which faces a 20 per cent tariff, has already vowed to retaliate in "a calm, carefully phased, unified way", EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that the United States and Europe can establish a very close partnership," Musk said in a video address to a gathering of the Italian hard-right party La Liga.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America," he added in the video, posted on Musk's social media platform X by La Liga's leader, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire said he favoured "more freedom for people to move between Europe and North America" for work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That has certainly been my advice to the president," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he reiterated his condemnation of what he saw as mass immigration. (AFP)

<img alt="Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi received the Mithra Vibhushana medal from Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake as a sign of their friendship. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799057_1_20250405194538.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India secured defence and energy deals with neighbouring Sri Lanka on Saturday during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake rolled out the red carpet for Modi and conferred on him the country's highest civilian honour for "the deep personal friendship" shown to the smaller neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that our security interests are aligned," Modi said during a televised ceremony from Dissanayake's office in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our security is interdependent and interconnected."
  <br>
  <br>
  A five-year defence cooperation agreement provides training of Sri Lankan military personnel in India as well as information and technology sharing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake applauded what he called "India's rise as a world power, not just a regional power."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have reiterated our position to Prime Minister Modi that Sri Lankan territory will not be allowed to be used by anyone to undermine India's security," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Dissanayake welcomed Modi – the first foreign dignitary to visit Colombo since the leftist leader swept to power last year – with a 19-gun salute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders also celebrated the start of construction of a 120-megawatt solar power project, developed as a joint venture between the two nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The solar plant, located in the island's northeastern Trincomalee district, had been stalled for years but was reinvigorated with New Delhi's backing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi's visit to Sri Lanka followed a summit in Thailand and a string of meetings with leaders of neighbouring nations as he sought to shore up India's regional ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Bangkok BIMSTEC meeting – the grouping of seven nations on the Bay of Bengal – Modi held a rare face-to-face meeting with Myanmar's junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also held talks on Friday with the interim leader of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus – the first such meeting since a revolution in Dhaka ousted New Delhi's long-time ally Sheikh Hasina and sent relations into a tailspin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi also met on Friday in Bangkok with his Nepali counterpart, KP Sharma Oli – their first meeting since Oli returned to power last year – as well as Tshering Tobgay of Bhutan. (AFP)

    Myanmar quake death toll passes 3,300

<img alt="Many people have to sleep outdoors because their homes were destroyed. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799034_1_20250405153937.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a major earthquake in Myanmar has risen above 3,300, state media said on Saturday, as the United Nations aid chief made a renewed call for the world to help the disaster-struck nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The March 28 quake flattened buildings and destroyed infrastructure across the country, resulting in 3,354 deaths and 4,508 people injured, with 220 others missing, according to new figures published by state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than one week after the disaster, many people in the country are still without shelter, either forced to sleep outdoors because their homes were destroyed or wary of further collapses.
  <br>
  <br>
  A United Nations estimate suggests that more than three million people may have been affected by the 7.7-magnitude quake, compounding previous challenges caused by four years of civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN's top aid official on Saturday met with victims in the central Myanmar city of Mandalay – situated close to the epicentre and now grappling with severe damage across the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The destruction is staggering," Tom Fletcher wrote in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world must rally behind the people of Myanmar."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new toll was announced after the country's military junta chief Min Aung Hlaing returned from a rare foreign trip to a regional summit in Bangkok on Friday, where he met with leaders including the prime ministers of Thailand and India.
  <br>
  <br>
  The general's attendance at the summit courted controversy, with protesters at the venue displaying a banner calling him a "murderer" and anti-junta groups condemning his inclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  His armed forces have ruled Myanmar since a 2021 coup, when they wrested power from the civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking a multi-sided conflict that has yet to be resolved.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta has reportedly conducted dozens of attacks since the earthquake, including at least 16 since a temporary truce was announced on Wednesday, the UN said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Years of fighting have left Myanmar's economy and infrastructure in tatters, significantly hampering international efforts to provide relief since the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, Russia and India were among the first countries to provide support, sending rescue teams to Myanmar to help locate survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has traditionally been at the forefront of international disaster relief, but President Donald Trump has dismantled the country's humanitarian aid agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington said on Friday it was adding US$7 million on top of an earlier US$2 million in assistance to Myanmar. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's tariffs risk higher unemployment and will likely cause inflation to rise and growth to slow, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's dramatic trade measures announced earlier this week have tightened scrutiny of Powell and how the Fed will react to free falling financial markets and concerns that a prolonged trade war would ramp up consumer prices and joblessness rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth," Powell told an event in Virginia., adding that it was "too soon" to consider changes to US monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell spoke just minutes after Trump posted on social media, urging him to cut interest rates immediately and accusing him of playing politics in his role running the independent US central bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The larger-than-expected tariffs unveiled on Wednesday stack on top of earlier country-specific levies, meaning that China, for example, will now face a new levy totalling 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other top trading partners will also see higher rates, with the European Union now facing a 20 percent tariff from April 9, and India looking at a 26 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has also targeted specific sectors of the economy, recently slapping a 25 percent tariff on automobiles not made in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell said Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell's comments suggest the Fed is in no rush to cut its benchmark lending rate from its current elevated level of between 4.25 and 4.50 percent, as it continues its struggle to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent months, the Fed's progress in bringing inflation down to target has stalled, while growth has remained solid and the unemployment rate has hugged close to historic lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faced with this data, the Fed voted last month to extend its pause in rate cuts and signalled that it wanted to see how the new administration's policies would feed through to the economy before taking any action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fed policymakers - now including Powell - have warned that tariffs could cause prices to rise, with the extent of the price increase likely determined by the rollout of the levies and how consumers and businesses respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Powell's speech on Friday, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social account to insist that his tariff policy would not change despite the market reaction and called on Powell to act.
  <br>
  <br>
  "CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!" wrote Trump, who first nominated Powell to run the Fed, before turning against him during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking Friday, Powell insisted he had no plans to step down as Fed chair before his term ends next year. "I fully intend to serve all of my term," he said during the Virginia event. (AFP)

    Trump extends TikTok deadline to find buyer

<img alt="The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798987_1_20250405031437.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Friday extended the deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States, allowing 75 more days to find a solution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "My administration has been working very hard on a deal to save TikTok, and we have made tremendous progress," Trump said on Truth Social, just hours before the deadline was to expire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A transaction requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."
  <br>
  <br>
  The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has well over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or get shut down in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has insisted his administration is near a deal to find a buyer for TikTok and keep it from shutting down that would involve multiple investors but has given few details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the hours before that deadline, TikTok was temporarily shut down in the United States and disappeared from app stores, to the dismay of millions of users.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican president quickly announced an initial 75-day delay, and TikTok subsequently restored service to users, returning to the Apple and Google app stores in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added on Friday that he would "continue working in good faith with China."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to reports, the solution in the works would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance's share. ABC News reported on Friday that Walmart was also in the mix.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok's valuable algorithm. "TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it's simply not as powerful," said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Other proposals include an initiative called "The People's Bid for TikTok", launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt's Project Liberty initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans. (AFP)

    Trump wants 'direct talks' with Iran on nukes deal

<img alt="President Trump says that last month he wrote to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to call for nuclear negotiations. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798967_1_20250404204544.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he wanted "direct talks" with Tehran on a nuclear deal, after he threatened to bomb Iran if it develops nuclear weapons.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has given Iran's leaders a two-month deadline to reach an agreement on the country's nuclear programme, which has strained relations with Western nations for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Western countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of pursuing a nuclear weapon, which Tehran has denied, insisting its enrichment activities were solely for peaceful purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's better if we have direct talks," he told reporters onboard the presidential plane Air Force One.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it goes faster and you understand the other side a lot better than if you go through intermediaries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said last week that Tehran would not engage in direct talks with Washington "until there is a change in the other side's approach towards the Islamic Republic."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump in his first term ripped up a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by predecessor Barack Obama and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal, sealed between Tehran and world powers, had required Iran to limit its nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They wanted to use intermediaries, I don't think that's necessarily true anymore," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they're concerned, I think they feel vulnerable. I don't want them to feel that way," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they want to meet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said last month he had written to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to call for nuclear negotiations and warn of possible military action if Tehran refused.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khamenei responded by saying that US threats "will get them nowhere" and warned of reciprocal measures "if they do anything malign" against Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump last week said "there will be bombing" of Iran if it does not drop its efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's outreach comes at a weak point for the Islamic Republic after Israel decimated two of its allies – Hamas, the Palestinian militants who attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, and Lebanon's Hezbollah. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday announced the imposition of tariffs of 34 percent on all goods from the United States, as a countermeasure to the sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  US president Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports. That was on top of the existing tariff of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Ministry of Finance said the countermeasure will be effective from April 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ministry of Commerce, meanwhile, said China has filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organisation (WTO), following the US slapping of what it called "reciprocal tariffs" on its trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson said the move by the US seriously violated WTO rules and damaged the legitimate rights of WTO members, slamming the US for endangering the stability of the global economic and trade order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry also said it had decided to add 11 US firms to its unreliable entity list, with immediate effect, in order to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also announced controls on the export of seven rare earths, with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the nation's General Administration of Customs announced the suspension of import qualifications for six US companies. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump unveiled the first "gold card," a residency permit to be sold for US$5 million each, aboard Air Force One on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Holding a prototype that bore his face and an inscription "The Trump Card," the Republican president told reporters that the special visa would probably be available "in less than two weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the first buyer," he said. "Pretty exciting, huh?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump previously said that sales of the new visa, a high-priced version of the traditional green card, would bring in job creators and could be used to reduce the US national deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire former real estate tycoon, who has made the deportation of millions of undocumented migrants a priority for his second term, said the new card would be a route to highly prized US citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said in February that his administration hoped to sell "maybe a million" of the cards and did not rule out that Russian oligarchs may be eligible. (AFP)

    Israel kills Hamas 'commander' in Lebanon strike

<img alt="The strike in a residential area of Sidon killed the official and his adult son and daughter. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798944_1_20250404164812.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel said it killed a commander of the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday in a strike in the Lebanese port city of Sidon that also killed his adult son and daughter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam condemned the strike as a "flagrant attack on Lebanese sovereignty" and a breach of the November 27 ceasefire with Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overnight, the (army and the domestic security agency Shin Bet) conducted a targeted strike in the Sidon area, eliminating the terrorist Hassan Farhat, commander of Hamas's western arena in Lebanon," the Israeli military said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It alleged that Farhat had orchestrated multiple attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians during the hostilities that followed the outbreak of war in Gaza in October 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  They included rocket fire on the Israeli town of Safed on February 14, 2024, that killed an Israeli soldier, the military added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike on a flat in a residential area of Sidon killed the official and his adult son and daughter, said a Palestinian official.
  <br>
  <br>
  A witness saw the fourth-floor flat still on fire after the strike, which caused heavy damage to the apartment block and neighbouring buildings and sparked panic in the densely populated neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese state media had reported the 3:45 am (0045 GMT) strike on Sidon, saying at least three people were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A hostile drone raided a residential apartment... causing two successive explosions that led to a fire and extensive damage," the state-run National News Agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers rushed to the scene where they recovered "the bodies of three martyrs," NNA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lebanese prime minister called for "maximum pressure on Israel to force it to halt these continual attacks which target various districts, many of them residential areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel struck south Beirut earlier this week, killing a Hezbollah Palestinian liaison officer in only the second raid on the capital since a November ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lebanese health ministry reported four dead in that strike, including a woman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese leaders condemned the attack, but Israel said it was in response to recent unclaimed rocket fire that Hezbollah insists it had no hand in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah spiralled into all-out conflict last September, and the group remains a target of Israeli air strikes despite the November 27 ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the truce, Hezbollah is supposed to redeploy its forces north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometres from the Israeli border, and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel is supposed to withdraw its forces across the UN-demarcated Blue Line, the de facto border, but has missed two deadlines to do so and continues to hold five positions it deems "strategic." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea discovered and seized two tons of cocaine hidden aboard a Norwegian-flagged vessel, authorities said on Friday, marking the country's largest drug bust to date.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Korea Coast Guard said they had found "two tons" of what they suspect to be pure cocaine on a Norwegian-flagged vessel which had departed from Mexico and made stops in Ecuador, Panama, and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operation was launched after South Korean authorities received intelligence from US agencies – the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) – that the vessel was carrying hidden narcotics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Korea Coast Guard and Korea Customs Service coordinated a large-scale search operation "consisting of a joint search team of 90 officers... along with two drug-sniffing dog units," the Korea Coast Guard said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the vessel docked at an east coast port in South Korea, the team immediately boarded the vessel and "discovered a hidden compartment behind the ship's engine room."
  <br>
  <br>
  The drugs were packed in 56 sacks, each holding some 30 to 40 kilogrammes of the drug, authorities said, bringing the total haul to around two tons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preliminary field tests confirmed the substances as suspected cocaine," the Korea Coast Guard official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The seizure is the largest in history, about five times bigger than the previous record, which was 404 kilogrammes of methamphetamine," said a Korea Customs Service official.
  <br>
  <br>
  The estimated street value is one trillion won (US$697 million), he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have launched a joint investigation team to question the vessel's captain and crew about the origin and intended destination of the drugs, and the route used to transport them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators also said they are looking into potential ties to international drug trafficking syndicates and will expand cooperation with the FBI and HSI.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has long ranked among the countries with low drug use globally, thanks to its strict laws and strong social stigma. (AFP)

 South Korea's Constitutional Court on Friday decided to oust President Yoon Suk Yeol, upholding parliament's impeachment motion over his short-lived imposition of martial law last year that sparked the country's worst political crisis in decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  With Yoon's ouster, a presidential election is required to take place within 60 days, according to the country's constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will continue to serve as acting president until the new president is inaugurated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling caps months of political turmoil that have overshadowed efforts to deal with the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump at a time of slowing growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, 64-year-old Yoon faces a criminal trial on insurrection charges. The embattled leader became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested on January 15 but was released in March after a court cancelled his arrest warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crisis was triggered by Yoon's December 3 declaration of martial law, which he has said was needed to root out "anti-state" elements and the opposition Democratic Party's alleged abuse of its parliamentary majority that he said was destroying the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon lifted the decree six hours later after lawmakers defied efforts by the security forces to seal off parliament and voted to reject it. Yoon has said he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule and tried to downplay the fallout, saying nobody was hurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Months of protests have followed, and it remained unclear if the political chaos sparked by Yoon's martial law declaration will now be eased by the court ruling. (Reuters)
