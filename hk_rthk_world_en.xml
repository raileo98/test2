<img alt="The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795902_1_20250316073140.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump’s proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,” he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. “A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,” Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 , a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said nine people, including journalists, were killed in Israeli strikes in the north on Saturday, an attack Hamas denounced as a "blatant violation" of the fragile ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Nine martyrs have been transferred (to hospital), including several journalists and a number of workers from the Al-Khair Charitable Organisation, as a result of the occupation targeting a vehicle with a drone in the town of Beit Lahia, coinciding with artillery shelling on the same area," said civil defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory reported that "nine martyrs and several injured, including critical cases, have arrived at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza Strip, due to the ongoing Israeli aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Israeli military said it struck "two terrorists... operating a drone that posed a threat to IDF troops in the area of Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Later, a number of additional terrorists collected the drone operating equipment and entered a vehicle. The IDF struck the terrorists," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the strikes, Hamas accused Israel of violating the Gaza truce deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The occupation (Israel) has committed a horrific massacre in the northern Gaza Strip by targeting a group of journalists and humanitarian workers, in a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of Hamas-affiliated media in Gaza, Ismail Thawabteh, said that local photo journalists were killed while "using a drone to capture images of a Ramadan dining table in Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they were "directly targeted by the occupation in two air strikes, despite their work being clear."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has carried out near-daily air strikes in Gaza since early March, often targeting what the military said were militants planting explosive devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce in Israel's war with Hamas, in effect since January 19, has largely held despite the attacks and with no agreement yet on extending the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the truce ended on March 1, but both Israel and Hamas have refrained from returning to all-out war. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he had urged Kyiv's Western allies to give "a clear position" on security guarantees, including about a potential foreign troop contingent on Ukrainian soil with a US backstop.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer held a virtual call with other European leaders and allies, including Zelensky, where Starmer said a "coalition of the willing" would help secure Ukraine "on the land, at sea and in the sky" in the event of a peace deal with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to continue working on the contingents that will form the foundation of Europe's future Armed Forces," Zelensky said in a post on X with an image of himself taking part in the call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Peace will be more reliable with European contingents on the ground and the American side as a backstop."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has also called for a US security backstop to help secure a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine in the three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian leader Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he supported in principle US President Donald Trump's proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine, but that Russia would fight on until several crucial conditions were worked out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky urged European leaders to dismiss Putin's opposition to European peacekeepers in Ukraine and blamed the Russian leader for stalling peace efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A ceasefire could have already happened, but Russia is doing everything to prevent it," he said. (Reuters)

    Captain of North Sea crash ship in UK court

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Russian captain of a cargo ship which struck a tanker in the North Sea off the UK's northeastern coast appeared in court on Saturday charged with gross negligence manslaughter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vladimir Motin, 59, appeared before magistrates in the port of Hull, where he was remanded in custody. He did not enter a plea, and will next appear in the Old Bailey in London on April 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, was arrested on Monday after his ship, the Portuguese-flagged Solong, rammed into the fuel-laden tanker Stena Immaculate, setting both vessels ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Humberside Police said earlier that "extensive searches" by HM Coastguard to locate a missing crew member from the Solong had failed to locate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crew member was identified by state prosecutors as Mark Angelo Pernia, a 38-year-old Filipino, who is now presumed dead, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-flagged tanker, which had been chartered by the US military, was anchored off the coast of Hull in northeastern England at the time of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were granted two extensions on Wednesday and Thursday to allow more time to question the captain, given "the complexities of the incident," the Humberside police force said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  An investigation led by the UK, with US and Portuguese teams, has been launched to determine the exact cause of the collision, and why the Solong did not deviate from its course before it ploughed into the tanker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK government has ruled out foul play so far. (AFP)

    Putin will have to 'come to table,' UK PM tells summit

<img alt='Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have been leading efforts to assemble a so-called "coalition of the willing."  Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795873_1_20250315201758.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK premier Keir Starmer said on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would "sooner or later" have to "come to the table" as he opened a virtual summit to drum up support for a coalition willing to protect any eventual ceasefire in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British prime minister told some 25 fellow leaders as they joined a virtual call hosted by Downing Street that they should focus on how to strengthen Ukraine, protect any ceasefire and keep up the pressure on Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Ukraine had shown it was the "party of peace" by agreeing to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, "Putin is the one trying to delay," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Putin is serious about peace, I think it's very simple, he has to stop his barbaric attacks on Ukraine and agree to a ceasefire, and the world is watching," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight fighting continued in the relentless three-year war, with Russia saying it had taken two more villages in its Kursk border region where it has launched an offensive to wrest back seized territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  As moves have gathered pace for a ceasefire, Moscow has pushed this week to retake a large part of the land that Ukraine originally captured in western Kursk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian defence ministry said troops took control over the villages of Zaoleshenka and Rubanshchina – north and west of the town of Sudzha, the main town that Moscow reclaimed this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv, meanwhile, said its air force had overnight downed 130 Iranian-made Russian-launched Shahed drones over 14 regions of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin has called on embattled Ukrainian troops in Kursk to "surrender," while his US counterpart Donald Trump urged the Kremlin to spare their lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't allow President Putin to play games with President Trump's deal," Starmer said in comments released by Downing Street late on Friday, ahead of Saturday's call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Kremlin's complete disregard for President Trump's ceasefire proposal only serves to demonstrate that Putin is not serious about peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have been leading efforts to assemble a so-called "coalition of the willing" ever since Trump opened direct negotiations with Moscow last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  They say the group is necessary – along with US support – to provide Ukraine with security guarantees by deterring Putin from violating any ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was on Saturday's call, said on Friday he had discussed "technical aspects" of how the ceasefire could be implemented with Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our teams continue to work on clear security guarantees, and they will be ready soon," Zelensky said on the social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and Macron have said they are willing to put British and French troops on the ground in Ukraine, but it is not clear if other countries are keen on doing the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called on Russia late on Friday to accept the proposal for a ceasefire and stop making statements aimed at "delaying the process."
  <br>
  <br>
  The French president also demanded that Moscow stop its "acts of violence" in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany on Friday likewise criticised Putin's response to the US-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine as "at best a delaying tactic."
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday he was "cautiously optimistic" about reaching a truce, but acknowledged there was "a lot of work that remains to be done."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has said he welcomes any offer of support for the coalition, raising the prospect that some countries could contribute logistics or surveillance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The call is expected to delve further into how countries plan to contribute to the coalition of the willing, ahead of a military planning session being held next week," the UK government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Starmer will say that countries "need to ratchet up economic pressure on Russia, to force Putin into negotiations, in the short term."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And be prepared to support a just and enduring peace in Ukraine over the long term and continue to ramp up our military support to Ukraine to defend themselves against increasing Russian attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  British Commonwealth partners Canada, Australia and New Zealand have been involved in early talks and are due to dial in to the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nato chief Mark Rutte and European Union chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa are also expected to take part, along with the leaders of Germany, Spain, Portugal, Latvia, Romania, Turkey and the Czech Republic, among others. (AFP)

    Cuba suffers fourth nationwide blackout in five months

<img alt="People gather in a neighbourhood during a national electrical grid collapse in Havana, Cuba. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795833_1_20250315115602.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cuba suffered a general blackout on Friday caused by a crash of its national electricity grid, officials said, the fourth major power outage on the cash-strapped communist island in five months.
 <br>
  <br>
  "At around 8:15 pm tonight, a breakdown... caused the significant loss of power in western Cuba and with it the fall of the national electricity system," the Ministry of Energy and Mines said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on the social network X, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz said the government was "working tirelessly" to restore power.
  <br>
  <br>
  In by now familiar scenes, the streets of Havana were plunged into darkness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a few hotels and private businesses with generators still had lights on, as did essential services such as hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Angelica Caridad Martinez, a resident of the central city of Camaguey, said she was about to sit down for dinner when the power failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not even hungry anymore," the 50-year-old said, "This situation is unsustainable, no one can live like this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The island of 9.7 million inhabitants has suffered three nationwide blackouts in the final months of 2024, two of them lasting several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The repeated outages comes as the island battles its worst economic crisis in 30 years, marked by widespread shortages of food, medicine and fuel, high inflation and a massive outflow of migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday night marked the first general blackout of 2025, but citizens face almost daily outages of four or five hours across much of Havana, while in rural provinces the periods without power can last 20 hours or longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cuba's eight thermal power plants, nearly all of which came online in the 1980s or 1990s, suffer routine failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Turkish floating power barges that help boost Cuba's national grid are fed with expensive imported fuel which is often in short supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cuba's leadership points to a six-decade-long US trade embargo that intensified during Donald Trump's first presidency for its difficulties in keeping the lights on.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make up its electricity shortfall, Cuba is racing to install a series of at least 55 solar farms with Chinese technology by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to authorities, these facilities will generate some 1,200 megawatts of power, about 12 percent of the national total. (AFP)

    Crew launch to ISS to replace stuck astronauts

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than nine months on the International Space Station, two astronauts are a step closer to returning home following the launch of a crew swap mission on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Falcon 9 rocket with a Crew Dragon fixed to its top blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carrying a four-member team bound for the orbital outpost.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We celebrate the countless individuals all over the world that have made this journey possible," said astronaut Nichole Ayers, the designated pilot of the Crew-10 mission, just before launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the real focus is what their arrival enables - the long-overdue departure from the ISS of NASA duo Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two former US Navy pilots have been stuck aboard the orbital lab since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Starliner returned empty, without experiencing further major issues and what was meant to have been a days-long round-trip for Wilmore and Williams has now stretched past nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by NASA astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station.
  <br>
  <br>
  What began as a technical failure has also spiraled into a political flashpoint, as President Donald Trump and his close advisor, Elon Musk, who leads SpaceX, have repeatedly suggested that former president Joe Biden "abandoned" the pair intentionally and rejected a plan to bring them back sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, has drawn attention for his bizarre remarks about the situation, referring to Williams, a decorated former naval captain, as "the woman with the wild hair" and speculating about the personal dynamic between the two.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've been left up there. I hope they like each other, maybe they love each other, I don't know," he said during a recent White House press conference. (AFP)

    Putin tells Ukraine troops in Kursk to 'surrender'

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on beleaguered Ukrainian troops in the Russian region of Kursk to "surrender" as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Russian leader of seeking to sabotage a ceasefire initiative.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump urged Putin to spare the lives of the Ukrainian troops as he said his envoy had held "productive" talks with Russia's leader on a proposed 30-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has mounted a rapid counteroffensive in the western border region of Kursk over the past week, recapturing much of the territory Ukraine seized in a shock incursion last August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat in Kursk would be a major blow to Ukraine's plans to use its hold on the region as a bargaining chip in peace talks for the three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are sympathetic to President Trump's call," Putin said in remarks broadcast on Russian television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment," Putin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said "thousands" of Ukrainian troops were "completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's military leadership denied the claims. "There is no threat of our units being encircled," Ukraine's General Staff posted on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky gave a more sober assessment in comments to reporters in Kyiv. "The situation in the Kursk region is obviously very difficult," he said, while insisting the campaign still had value.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's latest comments came as he gave an update on a meeting on Thursday between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin on a US-Ukrainian proposal for a 30-day pause in hostilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said on Thursday that he had "serious questions" about the proposal and that events in Kursk would influence the next moves towards a ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said on Friday that it was "cautiously optimistic" a deal could be reached, but that Trump and Putin had to speak directly before talks could progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin, addressing his Security Council, said he had read Trump's appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  While accusing Ukrainian troops of carrying out crimes against civilians that he said amounted to "terrorism", something Kyiv denies, Putin said he understood the call by Trump to take humanitarian considerations into account. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Carney was formally sworn in as prime minister of Canada on Friday, putting him in a position to fight tariffs from US President Donald Trump that could devastate the trade-dependent Canadian economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the presence of Governor General Mary Simon, the personal representative of King Charles, who is Canada's head of state, Carney took the oath of office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moment capped a momentous rise for the 59-year-old, who became the first Canadian prime minister without any serious political experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney plans to travel to London and Paris next week, said a diplomat aware of the plans. Canada has sought to shore up alliances in Europe as its relations with the United States sink to unprecedented lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney has reshaped his cabinet with a view to dealing with Washington. Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc is moving to the international trade portfolio and will be replaced by current Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney crushed his rivals on Sunday in a race to become leader of the ruling Liberal Party. He replaces Justin Trudeau, who spent more than nine years in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former head of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, successfully argued his position as an outsider with a history of tackling crises meant he was the best person to take on Trump, who has repeatedly talked about annexing Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Carney told reporters that he was ready to meet Trump when "there is respect for Canadian sovereignty."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he would keep in place retaliatory tariffs on US goods until the United States showed Canada some respect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts are underway to arrange a call between Trump and Carney in the next couple of days, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters on Friday. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte failed to show in person at the International Criminal Court on Friday at the opening of his crimes against humanity hearing over his deadly crackdown on narcotics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old, the first ex-Asian head of state to face charges at the ICC, was following by video link during a short hearing to inform him of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sounding frail and wearing a blue suit and tie, he spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth. The presiding judge allowed him to follow proceedings in absentia due to his long flight to The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the prosecutor's application for his arrest, he said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in the Philippines."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims' families have welcomed the trial as a chance to get justice, while Duterte supporters believe he was "kidnapped" and sent to The Hague amid a spectacular fallout with the ruling Marcos family. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police on Friday again extended the detention of the captain of a cargo ship that struck a tanker in the North Sea, citing the "complexities" of the case.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Russian captain was arrested on Monday on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter after his ship, the Solong, slammed into the tanker anchored off the coast of Hull in northeastern England, setting both ships ablaze and leaving one sailor presumed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were granted two extensions on Wednesday and Thursday to allow more time to question the 59-year-old captain due to "the complexities of the incident," the local Humberside police force said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police cited the location of both vessels at sea as one of the complications facing the probe, with the ships on fire for several days after the incident, requiring a massive firefighting response.
  <br>
  <br>
  While all crew onboard the jet fuel-laden tanker, the US-flagged Stena Immaculate, were safely rescued, one sailor from the Portuguese-flagged Solong remains missing and presumed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the government has ruled out foul play, investigators are still determining the causes of the crash, in which the Solong never deviated from its course and slammed into the Stena at 16 knots an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pockets of fire were still being reported on the deck of the Solong on Thursday evening, according to the UK Coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Extensive lines of enquiry are continuing," police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salvage teams boarded the vessels on Thursday to carry out initial damage assessments. (AFP)

    Lunar eclipse brings 'bloody' marvellous spectacle

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stargazers across a swathe of the world marvelled at a dramatic red "Blood Moon" during a rare total lunar eclipse in the early hours of Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The celestial spectacle was visible in the Americas and Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as well as in the westernmost parts of Europe and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The phenomenon happens when the sun, earth and moon line up, causing our planet to cast a giant shadow across its satellite.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the earth's shadow crept across the moon, it did not entirely blot out its white glow. Instead the moon glowed a reddish colour.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because the only sunlight that reaches the moon is "bent and scattered" as it goes through earth's atmosphere, said Daniel Brown, an astronomer at Britain's Nottingham Trent University.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is similar to how the light can become pink or red during sunrises or sunsets on earth, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The more clouds and dust there are in earth's atmosphere, the redder the moon appears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown called the lunar eclipse, which will last around six hours, "an amazing way to see the solar system in action."
  <br>
  <br>
  The period when the moon is completely in earth's shadow, called the totality, lasts just over an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  This event has been dubbed the "Blood Worm Moon," after one of the names given to March full moons by some Native Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first total lunar eclipse since 2022, but there will be another one in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's event is a "Micromoon," meaning the moon is the farthest away it gets from earth, making it appear about seven percent smaller than normal, according to the website Earthsky.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the opposite of a "Supermoon," as was seen during 2022's lunar eclipse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some stargazers will be in for another treat later this month. That will be a partial solar eclipse. (AFP)

    US Senate in race to avert government shutdown

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate finds itself on Friday in a familiar position, working to avoid a partial government shutdown with just hours to spare as Democrats confront two painful options: allowing passage of a bill they believe gives President Donald Trump vast discretion on spending decisions or voting no and letting a funding lapse ensue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer gave members of his caucus days to vent their frustration about the options before them, but late on Thursday made clear he will not allow a shutdown. His move gives Democrats room to side with Republicans and allow the continuing resolution, often described as a CR, to come up for a vote as soon as Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A procedural vote on Friday will provide a first test of whether the package has the 60 votes needed to advance, ahead of final voting likely later in the day. At least eight Democrats will need to join with Republicans to move the funding package forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  “While the CR still is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,” Schumer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congress has been unable to pass the annual appropriations bills designed to fund the government, so they've resorted to passing short-term extensions instead. The legislation before the Senate marks the third such continuing resolution for the current fiscal year, now nearly half over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legislation would fund the federal government through the end of September. It would trim non-defense spending by about US$13 billion from the previous year and increase defense spending by about US$6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly US$1.7 trillion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican-led House passed the spending bill on Tuesday and then adjourned. The move left senators with a decision to either take it or leave it. And while Democrats have been pushing for a vote on a fourth short-term extension, GOP leadership made clear that option was a non-starter. (AP)

    China hosts trilateral nuclear talks with Iran, Russia

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged an end to "illegal" sanctions on Iran as it hosted diplomats from that country and Russia on Friday for talks Beijing hopes will restart long-stalled negotiations on Tehran's nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi held their meeting in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A readout of the talks by CCTV said the three diplomats "exchanged views on the Iran nuclear issue and other issues of common concern".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma expressed China's support for "political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue based on mutual respect" after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We emphasised the necessity of ending all illegal, unilateral sanctions," Ma told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The relevant parties should work to eliminate the root causes of the current situation and abandon sanctions, pressure, and threats of the use of force."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement, the three countries reaffirmed that political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue remains the only viable and practical option for the Iranian nuclear issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which had imposed curbs on Tehran's nuclear development in return for sanctions relief, during US President Donald Trump's first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the agreement for a year after Washington's withdrawal but then began rolling back its commitments. Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump recently sent a letter to Tehran urging nuclear talks, warning of possible military action if it refuses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded that he would not negotiate with the US while being "threatened", and Iran would not bow to US "orders" to talk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran has long denied that it is working on developing a nuclear weapon. But the International Atomic Energy Agency warned last month that Tehran was "dramatically" accelerating enrichment of uranium to near the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level. (AFP/Reuters)

 An American Airlines plane caught fire after landing at Denver International Airport, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flight 1006, which was headed from Colorado Springs to Dallas, diverted to Denver and landed safely around 5.15pm on Thursday after the crew reported engine vibrations, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While taxiing to the gate, an engine on the Boeing 737-800 caught fire, the FAA added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers stood on one of the plane’s wings as smoke surrounded the aircraft. The FAA said passengers exited using the slides.
  <br>
  <br>
  American said the flight experienced an engine-related issue after taxiing to the gate. There was no immediate clarification on exactly when the plane caught fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 172 passengers and six crew members were taken to the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twelve people were transported to hospitals with minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We thank our crew members, DEN team and first responders for their quick and decisive action with the safety of everyone on board and on the ground as the priority,” American said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters put out the blaze by  evening, an airport spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said it will investigate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country has seen a recent spate of aviation disasters and close calls stoking fears about air travel, though flying remains a very safe mode of transport. (AP)

    Japanese duo pay for Great Wall buttocks 'prank'

<img alt="The two Japanese were caught soon after their stunt at the Great Wall. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795690_1_20250314111711.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Japanese tourists in their 20s were detained for two weeks in China then deported for taking photos showing exposed buttocks at the Great Wall, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident at the World Heritage site near Beijing concerned a man who showed his bottom and a woman who took photos, NTV and other Japanese media outlets reported on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's foreign ministry said on Friday that "the embassy of Japan in China confirmed on January 3 that two Japanese nationals were detained by local authorities at the Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  They "were subsequently released and returned to Japan during January", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese embassy did not reply to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists were detained on the spot by security guards and held for around two weeks, the reports said, citing sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exposing the lower half of the body in a public place is against the law in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists reportedly told the embassy they did it as a prank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reports sparked outrage in China, where memories of atrocities committed during Japan's occupation of the country in the 1930s and 40s still evoke strong feelings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hashtag translating to "Japanese man and woman detained for indecent behaviour at the Great Wall" had been viewed more than 60 million times on Weibo by Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many top-liked comments blasted the tourists for the act, with some using hateful language toward Japanese people.
  <br>
  <br>
  One comment by actor Chen Yitian, who has over seven million followers on the platform, condemned them for doing "shameful things on my Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others suggested China ban all Japanese visitors. (AFP)

    US influencer visa under review after wombat outcry

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia is reviewing an American influencer’s visa after she posted video of her snatching a baby wombat from its mother.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sam Jones, who describes herself as an “outdoor enthusiast & hunter,” made her Instagram account private on Thursday after she was widely condemned for the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  It shows her lifting the wombat joey by its front legs in darkness from a roadside and running away from its mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I caught a baby wombat,” she says, as a man filming her laughs. She returns the wombat to the roadside after several seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said her visa was under review.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The department is now working through the conditions on her current visa and determining whether immigration law has been breached,” Burke said in a statement on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I can’t wait for Australia to see the back of this individual, I don’t expect she will return,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added his voice to the criticism. “To take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage,” Albanese told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there. Take another animal that can actually fight back rather than stealing a baby wombat from its mother,” Albanese added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones, who also uses the name Samantha Strable, closed her social media channels to messages and couldn’t be reached for comment on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wombat appears to be a common wombat, also known as a bare-nosed wombat. It is a protected marsupial found only in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yolandi Vermaak, founder of the animal care charity Wombat Rescue, said separating the young wombat from its mother created a risk that the mother would reject her offspring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My biggest concern is that we didn’t actually see mom and baby getting reunited. When she put it down, it looked disoriented. It was turned away from where the mother was last seen. So we don’t know if mom and baby actually found each other again,” Vermaak told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. (AP)

    Johns Hopkins University to cut thousands of jobs

<img alt="President Trump signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to allow time to assess overseas expenses. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795666_1_20250314084123.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The prestigious Johns Hopkins University said on Thursday it was being forced to lay off more than 2,000 employees in the aftermath of the Trump administration's massive reduction in foreign aid funding.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is a difficult day for our entire community. The termination of more than US$800 million in USAID funding is now forcing us to wind down critical work here in Baltimore and internationally," the school, a leading institution of scientific research, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopkins, in Maryland's largest city an hour's drive north of the US capital, is eliminating more than 2,000 positions - 1,975 in projects across 44 countries and 247 jobs in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts impact several key programs, including the university's medical school and school of public health, and Jhpiego, a global health non-profit organisation founded at the university more than 50 years ago and which works to improve health in countries worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Johns Hopkins is immensely proud of the work done by our colleagues in Jhpiego, the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the School of Medicine to care for mothers and infants, fight disease, provide clean drinking water, and advance countless other critical, life-saving efforts around the world," the university said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts make Johns Hopkins one of the universities most deeply impacted by the slash of federal funding for research.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university receives roughly US$1 billion annually in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is currently running 600 clinical trials, according to The New York Times, adding that Hopkins is one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging such cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Agency for International Development (USAID), the largest funding agency for Jhpiego, distributes humanitarian aid around the world, with health and emergency programs in around 120 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, who is dismantling the humanitarian agency, signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to allow time to assess overseas expenses. Critics warn that slashing USAID work will affect millions of people. (AFP)

    Duterte's first court appearance set for Friday

<img alt="People protest against former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte in front of the ICC in the Hague. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795667_1_20250314085246.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodrigo Duterte's first appearance at the International Criminal Court has been set for Friday, the court said, as the former Philippines president faces crimes against humanity charges over his deadly war on drugs.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the court late on Thursday said Duterte's first appearance would take place at 2 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old will appear before judges for a hearing where he will be informed of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed tens of thousands of people.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he landed in The Hague, the former leader appeared to accept responsibility for his actions, saying in a Facebook video: "I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's stunning arrest in Manila came amid a spectacular meltdown in relations between his family and the Marcos family, who had previously joined forces to run the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice-President Sara Duterte - Rodrigo's daughter - are at loggerheads, with the latter facing an impeachment trial over charges including an alleged assassination plot against Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte is in The Netherlands to support her father, after labelling his arrest "oppression and persecution", with the Duterte family having sought an emergency injunction from the Supreme Court to stop his transfer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The high-profile Duterte case also comes at a critical moment for the ICC, as it faces unprecedented pressure from all sides, including US sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court over what he said were "illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Gaza war. (AFP)

    Trump threatens tariffs on EU alcohol

<img alt="President Trump's tariff threat could hit a market worth US$10 billion to EU producers in 2023, according to World Trade Organization figures. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795656_1_20250314055609.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to slap a 200 percent tariff on wine, cognac, and other alcohol imports from Europe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's threat came in response to a European Union plan to impose tariffs on American whisky and other products next month - which itself is a response to Trump's 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports that took effect on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission had no immediate comment on Trump's post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, a neighbour and close ally that is the US's biggest aluminium provider, has also announced countermeasures of its own to Trump's metals tariffs and has taken the dispute to the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  At an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte later on Thursday, he said he would not back off from reciprocal tariffs he has vowed to impose on all trading partners on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been ripped off for years, and we're not going to be ripped off," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcohol is shaping up to be a key friction point in the brewing trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the EU's proposed countermeasures, worth US$28.31 billion in all, would apply to products that have little more than symbolic value, such as dental floss and bathrobes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the proposed 50 percent duty on US bourbon would be a significant hit for the industry, which has seen exports grow steadily since the United States lifted tariffs Trump imposed during his first term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU accounted for roughly 40 percent of all spirits exports in 2023, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Likewise, the United States accounts for 31 percent of EU wine and spirits exports, according to Eurostat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry officials on both sides of the Atlantic urged their leaders to de-escalate. "This cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation must end now!" said spiritsEurope, an industry trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump says tariffs are a crucial tool to revitalise US industries that have withered due to decades of globalisation. But US importers and distributors said it would lead to lost sales, layoffs, and shuttered businesses. (Reuters)

    Pro-Palestinian protesters fill NY's Trump Tower

<img alt="Police officers detain a protester inside Trump Tower during a rally against the ICE detention of Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795650_1_20250314053853.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scores of people poured into the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday to protest the arrest and detention of Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, whom the Trump administration aims to deport over his pro-Palestinian activism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The arrest of Khalil, who is in immigration custody in Louisiana after his arrest in New York on Saturday, has sparked an outcry by Democratic lawmakers, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian territories, and civil liberty advocates, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jewish Voice for Peace, which describes itself as a progressive Jewish anti-Zionist organisation, carried out Thursday's demonstration. The group said it was "taking over the Trump Tower to register our mass refusal."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not stand by as this fascist regime attempts to criminalise Palestinians and all those calling for an end to the Israeli government’s US-funded genocide of the Palestinian people," the group said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump Tower, located on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, is home to the Trump Organisation and where President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump own a penthouse apartment. Their son, Barron, has been living there since beginning his freshman year at New York University in the fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 150 protesters gathered at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the New York Police Department estimated. Images on social media showed demonstrators carrying signs saying: "FIGHT NAZIS NOT STUDENTS" and "FREE MAHMOUD FREE PALESTINE."
  <br>
  <br>
  Video showed police arresting some of the protesters. The NYPD said 98 arrests were made.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaz Daughtry, the deputy mayor for public safety, said on Fox News that there were no injuries and all the protesters had been removed from the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump Organisation did not immediately provide comment. By arresting Khalil on Saturday, the Trump administration began fulfilling its campaign promise to deport foreign-born activists who participated in the wave of protests on U.S. college campuses last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States, has been a prominent figure in the pro-Palestinian student movement at Columbia, perhaps the most prominent of the dozens of U.S. universities where demonstrations erupted last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump branded Khalil a "Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student" on social media and has said his arrest is the first "of many to come." (Reuters)

 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he had "serious questions" about Washington's plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but Moscow was ready to discuss it with US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Putin made his first comments on the plan, which Ukraine agreed to on Tuesday at talks with the United States, saying he was "for" the proposed ceasefire, but "there are nuances," and he had "serious questions" about how it would work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin told reporters, "I think we need to talk to our American colleagues... Maybe have a phone call with President Trump and discuss this with him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has called for Russia to agree to a ceasefire without any conditions, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying on Tuesday, "That's what we want to know, if they're prepared to do it unconditionally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Putin's statement was "promising" but "not complete."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've actually discussed many of the details of a final agreement." Now we're going to see if Russia is there, and, if not, it will be a very disappointing moment for the world," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After visiting a military headquarters in the Kursk region Wednesday, the Russian president hailed troops' progress against Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Trump pushes for a speedy end to the more than three-year conflict, his envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow Thursday to discuss the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has expressed optimism that his team can secure a ceasefire, despite Moscow's battlefield gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can get Russia to stop, then we have a full ceasefire. And I think it'll never go back to war," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier Thursday had criticised the lack of an official response from Moscow, saying on social media that this shows "Russia seeks to prolong the war and postpone peace for as long as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of talks, Putin said, "We agree with proposals to cease hostilities, but on the basis that cessation would lead to long-term peace and address the root causes of the crisis." (AFP)

 The bodies of at least 25 people, including 21 hostages, killed in a train siege by separatist gunmen in Pakistan were retrieved from the site yesterday ahead of the first funerals, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Security forces said they freed more than 340 passengers in a two-day rescue operation that ended late on Wednesday after a separatist group bombed a remote track in mountainous southwest Balochistan and stormed a train with around 450 passengers on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army, one of a number of separatist groups that accuse outsiders of plundering natural resources in Balochistan near the borders with Afghanistan and Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Death tolls have varied, with the military saying that "21 innocent hostages" were killed as well as four soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A railway official said the bodies of the 25 people were transported by train away from the site of the siege to the nearby town of Mach on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deceased were identified as 19 military passengers, one police and one railway official, while four bodies are yet to be identified," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers who escaped said after walking for hours through rugged mountains to reach safety that they saw people being shot dead by militants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first funerals are expected to take place on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif was also expected to visit Balochistan, his office said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean military investigators charged two air force pilots on Thursday with criminal negligence over an accidental bombing of a village last week during a training exercise, which injured at least 29 people and caused extensive property damage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defence ministry investigators have confirmed that errors by the pilots when they entered coordinates into the aircraft systems were "direct factors" behind the accidental bombing, the ministry's Criminal Investigation Command said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilots were charged with criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the command said, adding the investigation of the incident is ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight unguided air-to-surface bombs were launched from two fighter jets and landed on a village in Pocheon near the border with North Korea during live-fire exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several areas in Pocheon and neighbouring regions have training grounds used by the South Korean and US militaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents have for years complained about potential safety risks and disturbances from military units being mobilised in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two pilots have been taken off flight duties and a review of their flight mission certification has been scheduled, a ministry official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The air force chief of staff has apologised for the accident and pledged to review mission procedures to prevent similar incidents. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A US judge on Wednesday extended his order blocking federal authorities from deporting a detained Columbia University student, in a case that has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's pledge to deport some pro-Palestinian college activists.
 <br>
  <br>
  US District Judge Jesse Furman had temporarily blocked Mahmoud Khalil's deportation earlier this week, and extended the prohibition on Wednesday in a written order following a hearing in Manhattan federal court to allow himself more time to consider whether the arrest was unconstitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Homeland Security says Khalil is subject to deportation under a legal provision holding that migrants whose presence in the country are deemed by the US Secretary of State to be incompatible with foreign policy may be removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States," read the DHS document, dated March 9, ordering Khalil to appear before an immigration judge on March 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document did not provide additional detail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DHS did not immediately responded to requests for comment from reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khalil's lawyers say his arrest on Saturday by DHS agents outside his university residence in Manhattan was in retaliation for his outspoken advocacy against Israel's assault on Gaza following Hamas' October 2023 attack, and thus violated Khalil's right to free speech under the US Constitution's First Amendment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr. Khalil was identified, targeted, detained and is being processed for deportation on account of his advocacy for Palestinian rights," Khalil's lawyer Ramzi Kassem said in court. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the EU vowed on Wednesday to strike back and defend their economic interests against sweeping new US steel and aluminium tariffs, moving Washington closer to an all-out trade war with two major partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  The levies took effect just after midnight on Wednesday "with no exceptions or exemptions", as promised by the White House – despite countries' efforts to avert them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said it would impose "a series of countermeasures" from April 1 in response to the "unjustified trade restrictions" from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply regret this measure," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, adding that "the countermeasures we take today are strong but proportionate".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US are applying tariffs worth US$28 billion, we are responding with countermeasures worth" the equivalent in euros, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And China, the world's leading steel manufacturer – though not a major exporter of the product to the United States – vowed "all necessary measures" in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's tariffs would "seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system", she warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed steep tariffs on major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China since returning to office, allowing only a partial rollback for his country's neighbours while vowing fresh levies from April 2. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was turned over on Wednesday to the custody of the International Criminal Court, following his arrest on a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drugs crackdowns he oversaw while in office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old former president arrived at Rotterdam The Hague Airport in the Netherlands earlier on Wednesday on a flight from Manila, following his arrest there on an ICC request on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups and families of victims hailed Duterte’s arrest, and the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, called it “a crucial step in our continuous work to ensure accountability for the victims of the most serious crimes under ICC jurisdiction.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters of Duterte criticised the administration of current Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Duterte's political rival, for arresting and surrendering the former leader to a court whose jurisdiction his supporters dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch-based court said in a statement that medical assistance was made available "as a precautionary measure'' at the airport for Duterte, in line with standard procedures when a suspect arrives. The court did not comment on his state of health.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ambulance drove to the hangar where his plane was taken, and medics wheeled a gurney inside.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police helicopter hovered close to the airport, and later a black SUV was seen leaving the airport accompanied by police. Its destination was not immediately clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Within days, Duterte will face an initial appearance where the court will confirm his identity, check that he understands the charges against him and set a date for a hearing to assess if prosecutors have sufficient evidence to send him to a full trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Duterte could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Nasa telescope was launched into space from California on Tuesday for a mission to explore the origins of the universe and to search the Milky Way galaxy for hidden reservoirs of water, a key ingredient for life.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US space agency's megaphone-shaped SPHEREx – short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer – was carried aloft by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  During its planned two-year mission, the observatory will collect data on more than 450 million galaxies, as well as more than 100 million stars in the Milky Way. It will create a three-dimensional map of the cosmos in 102 colors – individual wavelengths of light – and will study the history and evolution of galaxies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission aims to deepen the understanding of a phenomenon known as cosmic inflation, referring to the universe's rapid and exponential expansion from a single point in a fraction of a second after the Big Bang that occurred roughly 13.8 billion years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SPHEREx is really trying to get at the origins of the universe – what happened in those very few first instants after the Big Bang," SPHEREx instrument scientist Phil Korngut of Caltech said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reigning theory that describes this is called inflation. As its name posits, it proposes that the universe underwent an enormous expansion, going from smaller than the size of an atom, expanding a trillion-trillion fold in just a tiny fraction of a second," Korngut said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director of the Astrophysics Division at Nasa headquarters, said SPHEREx is going to search for "reverberations from the Big Bang – the fractions of a second after the Big Bang that echoed into the areas SPHEREx is going to directly observe."
  <br>
  <br>
  SPHEREx will take pictures in every direction around Earth, splitting the light from billions of cosmic sources such as stars and galaxies into their component wavelengths to determine their composition and distance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Within our galaxy, SPHEREx will search for reservoirs of water frozen on the surface of interstellar dust grains in large clouds of gas and dust that give rise to stars and planets.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will look for water and molecules including carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide frozen on the surface of dust grains in molecular clouds, which are dense regions of gas and dust in interstellar space. Scientists believe that reservoirs of ice bound to dust grains in these clouds are where most of the universe's water forms and dwells. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX on Wednesday scrubbed the expected launch of a replacement crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station that would have set in motion the long-awaited homecoming of US astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been stuck in space for nine months after a trip on Boeing's faulty Starliner.
 <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX called off the flight over a last-minute technical issue with the rocket's launchpad, officials said on a livestream of the launch countdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear when the next launch opportunity would be. The reason for the scrub suggests that SpaceX and Nasa could try to launch again in the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa had been set to launch a SpaceX rocket from Florida carrying a replacement crew for the International Space Station in a mission that would set up the return to Earth of Wilmore and Williams - stuck in space for nine months after a trip on Boeing's faulty Starliner. The US space agency had moved up the mission by two weeks after President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, called for Wilmore and Williams to be brought back earlier than Nasa had planned.
  <br>
  <br>
  A planned eight-day stay on the orbiting station has dragged on for Wilmore and Williams, a pair of veteran astronauts and US Navy test pilots. Starliner returned to Earth without them last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX's rocket had been scheduled to blast off from the Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral at 7.48 pm ET (2348 GMT) with a crew of two US astronauts and one astronaut each from Japan and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams have been working on research and maintenance with the space station's other astronauts and have remained safe, according to Nasa. Williams told reporters in a March 4 call that she is looking forward to seeing her family and pet dogs upon returning home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us," Williams said of her family. "We're here, we have a mission - we're just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun." The flight, known as Crew-10, normally would be considered a routine astronaut rotation. Instead, it has become entangled in politics as Trump and Musk have sought - without offering evidence - to blame former President Joe Biden for the delayed return of Wilmore and Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demands by Trump and Musk for an earlier return were an unusual intervention in Nasa's human spaceflight operations. The mission previously had a target date of March 26, but Nasa swapped a delayed SpaceX capsule with a different one that would be ready sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the new crew arrives aboard the station, Wilmore and Williams and two others - Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov - can return to Earth in a capsule that has been attached to the station since September, as part of the prior Crew-9 mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams cannot leave until the new Crew-10 craft arrives in order to keep the ISS staffed with enough US astronauts for maintenance, according to Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams flew to the station in June as the first test crew of Boeing's Starliner, which suffered propulsion system issues in space. Nasa deemed it too risky for the astronauts to fly home on the Boeing craft. This led to the current plan to bring them home in a SpaceX capsule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing built Starliner under a US$4.5 billion contract with Nasa to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the US space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from American soil. Last year's mission had marked Starliner's first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before Nasa could certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starliner's development has been plagued with engineering issues and cost overruns since 2019, putting it far behind SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which was developed under a similar Nasa contract worth at least US$4 billion. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Carney will be sworn in as Canada's next prime minister on Friday morning, marking the final day of Justin Trudeau's more than nine years in power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Governor General Mary Simon will preside over the swearing-in of Carney and his cabinet ministers Friday at 11 a.m., her office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former central banker who led the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, was elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada on Sunday. He will become Canada's 24th prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney will take over at a tumultuous time in Canada, which is in the midst of a trade war with long-time ally the United States under President Donald Trump and must hold a general election soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's new cabinet may be about half the size of Trudeau's executive, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cabinet is expected to have between 15 and 20 ministers, down from 37 currently including the prime minister, the report added, citing a source. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada on Wednesday announced additional tariffs on US$20.7 billion of US goods, retaliating against American levies on Canadian steel and aluminium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The country’s finance minister Dominic Leblanc said the Canadian tariffs that come into force on Thursday will hit products that include computers and sports equipment, and were in response to President Donald Trump's 25 percent levy on Canadian aluminium and steel, which he called "unjustified and unreasonable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The escalation of the US-Canada trade war occurred as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prepares to hand over power to his successor Mark Carney, who won the leadership race of the ruling Liberals last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has said that Canada could impose non-tariff measures such as restricting oil exports to the US or levying export duties on minerals if American tariffs persist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's hyper-focus on tariffs since taking office in January has rattled investor, consumer and business confidence in ways that economists worry could cause a US recession and further lag on the global economy. (Agencies)

 China will host Russia and Iran for trilateral talks on Tehran's nuclear programme on Friday, the Foreign Ministry said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The three parties will exchange views on the Iranian nuclear issue and other issues of mutual interest," a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu will chair the meeting in Beijing, which will be attended by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov Sergey Alexeevich and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting will follow a closed-door gathering of the United Nations Security Council in New York the same day regarding Iran's expansion of its stocks of uranium that are close to weapons-grade.
  <br>
  <br>
  During US President Donald Trump's first term, which ended in 2021, Washington withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal that had imposed curbs on the country's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the agreement for a year after Washington's withdrawal, but then began rolling back its commitments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenland's centre-right opposition Democrats have won a surprise victory in legislative elections, more than tripling their support to 29.9 percent of votes, official results showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nationalist Naleraq party, the most ardent pro-independence party which campaigned for the Arctic island to cut ties with Denmark as soon as possible, also saw its support more than double to 24.5 percent of votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two parties in the outgoing centre-left coalition government came in third and fourth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-autonomous Danish territory came under global spotlight this year after US President Donald Trump vowed to make Greenland part of the United States, saying it is vital to US security interests. The idea was rejected by most Greenlanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast island, with a population of just 57,000, has been caught up in a geopolitical race for dominance in the Arctic, where melting ice caps are making its resources more accessible and opening new shipping routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People want change ... We want more business to finance our welfare," said Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Demokraatit's leader and a former minister of industry and minerals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want independence tomorrow, we want a good foundation," Nielsen told reporters in Nuuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old will now hold talks with other parties to try and form a governing coalition. (Agencies)

    Trump's 25 pct tariffs on steel and aluminium in force

<img alt="A new wave of US tariffs sees levies of 25 percent on steel and aluminium imports. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795389_1_20250312121525.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday as prior exemptions, duty free quotas and product exclusions expired.
 <br>
  <br>
  His administration says the move is to reorder global trade norms in favour of America and its citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's action to bulk up protections for American steel and aluminum producers restores effective global tariffs of 25 percent on all imports of the metals and extends the duties to hundreds of downstream products made from the metals, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runup to the tariff deadline came with some drama on Tuesday as Trump threatened Canada with doubling the duty to 50 percent on its steel and aluminum exports to America.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump backed off those plans after Ontario Premier Doug Ford agreed to suspend his province's decision to impose a 25 percent surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York until earlier US tariffs were removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ford said he would fly to Washington on Thursday with Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc for talks with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other Trump officials to discuss revising the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident whip-sawed US financial markets already jittery over Trump's broad tariff offensive, but left unchanged Trump's original plans to strengthen the Section 232 national security tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed in 2018 during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House spokesperson described the US pressure on Canada as a "win" for the American people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Customs and Border Protection agency cut off imports qualifying for duty-free entry under quota arrangements well before the midnight deadline, saying in a bulletin to shippers that quota paperwork needed to be processed by 4.30pm local time on Tuesday at US ports of entry or the full tariffs would be charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move was welcomed by US steel producers as restoring Trump's original 2018 metals tariffs that had been weakened by numerous country exclusions and quotas and thousands of product-specific exclusions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By closing loopholes in the tariff that have been exploited for years, President Trump will again supercharge a steel industry that stands ready to rebuild America," Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip Bell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The countries most affected by the tariffs are Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the US, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea, which all have enjoyed some level of exemptions or quotas. (Reuters)

    US Education Department to cut half its staff
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The US Department of Education said affected employees will be placed on administrative leave from March 21. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795376_1_20250312104000.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Department of Education said on Tuesday it would lay off nearly half its staff, a possible precursor to closing altogether, as government agencies scrambled to meet US President Donald Trump's deadline to submit plans for a second round of mass layoffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The terminations are part of the department's "final mission," it said in a press release, alluding to Trump's vow to eliminate the department, which oversees US$1.6 trillion in college loans, enforces civil rights laws in schools and provides federal funding for needy districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The layoffs would leave the department with 2,183 workers, down from 4,133 when Trump took office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the latest step in Trump's sweeping effort to downsize the government, led by the world's richest person Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  DOGE has cut more than 100,000 jobs across the 2.3 million-member federal civilian bureaucracy, frozen most foreign aid and cancelled thousands of programmes and contracts, despite dozens of lawsuits challenging the legality of those moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  All US government agencies have been ordered to come up with large-scale layoff plans by Thursday, setting up the next phase of Trump's cost-cutting campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several agencies have offered employees payments to retire early to fulfill Trump's demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Department said affected employees will be placed on administrative leave starting on March 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union representing more than 2,800 department workers said it would fight the "draconian cuts".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, NASA announced on Tuesday the dismissal of its chief scientist and others, marking the latest in a series of administrative actions undermining climate change research.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the move affects only 23 people, a spokeswoman indicated more cuts are coming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first round notably eliminates the Office of the Chief Scientist, led by Katherine Calvin, a renowned climatologist who contributed to key UN climate reports. She and other US delegates were also barred from attending a major climate science meeting in China last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also eliminated are the Office of Technology, Policy, and Strategy, and the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Branch of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  NASA has so far avoided the deep cuts affecting other agencies, reportedly due to last-minute intervention by Jared Isaacman, Trump's nominee for NASA chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaacman, an e-payments billionaire and SpaceX customer, is seen as close to Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who has called climate change a "scam" and expressed disdain for the UN and climate science, has already pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement for a second time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, his administration has dismissed hundreds of employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the nation's other key climate agency, with more cuts expected. (Agencies)

    Maradona's medical team on trial over his death

<img alt="Fans of Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona hold a banner that reads ''Justice for God'' in Buenos Aires. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795364_1_20250312091631.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven Argentines went on trial on Tuesday accused of homicide for their alleged role in what prosecutors called the "horror theatre" of football legend Diego Maradona's death four years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maradona died on November 25, 2020, aged 60, while recovering at home from brain surgery for a blood clot, after decades battling cocaine and alcohol addictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On trial are a neurosurgeon, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a medical coordinator, a nursing coordinator, a doctor and a night nurse accused of being criminally negligent in the care they provided to the footballer in his final days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an opening statement, the prosecution said it intended to submit "solid" evidence that no member of the medical team "did what they were supposed to do" in the "horror theatre" that was Maradona's deathbed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Look, that's how Maradona died!" prosecutor Patricio Ferrari exclaimed in the courtroom, holding up a posthumous photo of Maradona, lying on his back in bed, his body grotesquely swollen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gruesome picture brought Maradona's three daughters, Jana, Dalma and Gianinna, who attended the start of the trial, to the verge of tears.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the accused] are lying to you when they say they did not take part in murder," Ferrari charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernando Burlando, lawyer for Dalma and Gianinna, described Maradona's medical team as "diabolical."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants face prison terms of between eight and 25 years if convicted on charges of "homicide with possible intent" - pursuing a course of action despite knowing it can cause death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the court, dozens of fans waved banners calling for "justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veronica Ojeda, Maradona's former partner and mother of one of his sons, 12-year-old Dieguito, tearfully thanked them for their support before entering the courthouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maradona was found dead two weeks after going under the knife, in a rented house in an exclusive Buenos Aires neighbourhood where he was brought after being discharged from hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was determined he died of heart failure and acute pulmonary edema, a condition where fluid accumulates in the lungs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The passing of the 1986 World Cup star plunged Argentina, and football fans worldwide, into mourning in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 120 witnesses, including members of Maradona's family and doctors who previously tended to him, are expected to testify in the long-delayed trial in the Buenos Aires suburb of San Isidro.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearings, adjourned until Thursday, are expected to run until July.
  <br>
  <br>
  A day nurse who found Maradona dead is to be tried separately, by jury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors accuse his medical team of pushing for Maradona to receive home care, which proved "reckless" and "totally deficient."
  <br>
  <br>
  They allege the footballer was abandoned to his fate for a "prolonged, agonising period" before his death. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington's looming tariffs on steel and aluminium are "entirely unjustified", Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday after failing to secure a last-minute exemption.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a friendly act," Albanese told reporters, after the White House dashed hopes that Australia would be excluded from blanket 25 percent levies on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Quite clearly it is not a positive step in our relationship. It is as simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's decision to slug close ally Australia was "entirely unjustified", Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship. Friends need to act in a way that reinforces, to our respective populations, the fact that we are friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the setback, Albanese said Australia would not retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese hinted that Australia may be one of the few nations to secure an exemption following a phone call with Trump in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials told Australian media overnight that the exemption was no longer on the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He considered it, and considered against it," spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told national broadcaster ABC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia is a minor global player in steel export markets but is a dominant source of iron ore, a key raw ingredient in the alloy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian steel producer BlueScope said it employed around 4,000 staff in the United States. (AFP)

<img alt="Smoke rises from the MV Solong cargo ship in the North Sea, off the coast of England. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795360_1_20250312090215.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British police on Tuesday arrested on suspicion of manslaughter the captain of a ship that crashed into a tanker in the North Sea, sparking a massive blaze and leaving one crew member missing, presumed dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investigations have already started into what led the cargo ship to strike the tanker carrying jet fuel on Monday, as fears remained of possible harm to the area's marine and wildlife.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK Coastguard, which led the operation, rescued 36 people on Monday, including all of the 23 crew on the US-flagged Stena Immaculate tanker, which had been chartered by the US military.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a missing member of the Solong cargo vessel crew was "likely deceased", UK under-secretary for transport Mike Kane told parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Humberside Police in northern England said they had arrested a 59-year-old man on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ernst Russ, owner of the cargo ship, then issued a statement saying that it "can confirm that the master of the... Solong has been detained by Humberside police in the UK".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The master and our entire team are actively assisting with the investigations," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane said the fire on the Stena Immaculate "appears to be extinguished" but this was not immediately confirmed by the Coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Solong is still alight and the fire on board the Stena Immaculate has greatly diminished," the UK Coastguard said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Coastguard was closely monitoring the Solong, which had broken free of the tanker overnight and was limping southwards, accompanied by four tugboats, including one which had a line attached to the stricken vessel.
  <br>
  <br>
  AFP photos taken during a helicopter fly-over showed smoke still pouring from the Solong, while a large hole could be seen in the side of the Stena Immaculate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident occurred at around 9:48 am local time on Monday when the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship ploughed into the tanker, anchored off the port of Hull.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German owners of the Solong on Tuesday said that the container ship was not carrying sodium cyanide, as had been reported the previous day. (AFP)

    Greenland votes in election eyed by Trump

<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenland voted on Tuesday in legislative elections that could yield a timeline for independence for the Danish self-governing territory coveted by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Possibly signalling a Trump effect, turnout was higher than usual in the sole polling station in the capital Nuuk, according to election officials who extended voting - which had been due to end at 8:00 pm - by half an hour to allow long lines of voters to cast their ballots.
  <br>
  <br>
  First results were expected several hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who has said he is determined to get his hands on the vast Arctic island "one way or the other", tried until the last minute to influence the vote, sparking astonishment, rejection, and, to a small degree, enthusiasm among the 57,000 Greenlanders, most of whom favour independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  After waiting in a long line with other voters, Greenland's outgoing Prime Minister Mute Egede - who celebrated his 38th birthday on Tuesday - cast his ballot shortly after polling statinos opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country is in the eye of the storm," he said in a video posted to Facebook just hours before the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The international community is watching us closely, and we have recently seen how much they are trying to influence our country," said Egede, leader of the left-green party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA).
  <br>
  <br>
  The lead-up of the election to choose the 31-seat parliament, the Inatsisartut, was mostly marked by debates on healthcare, education, and future ties with Denmark, which still controls foreign, defence and monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greenland's inhabitants - almost 90 percent of whom are Inuits - say they are tired of being treated like second-class citizens by their former colonial power, which they accuse of having historically suppressed their culture, carried out forced sterilisations and removed children from their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of Greenland's main political parties back independence but disagree on the timeframe. (AFP)

<img alt="US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks with the media following meetings with a Ukrainian delegation in Jeddah. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795341_1_20250312052757.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine endorsed an American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire and agreed to immediate negotiations with Russia in crunch talks in Jeddah on Tuesday after three years of grinding military conflict.
 <br>
  <br>
  The positive response from Ukraine prompted President Donald Trump's administration to lift a freeze on military aid and to predict the beginning to an end to three years of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Trump stunning allies by applying intense pressure on Kyiv and reaching out to Moscow, Ukrainian officials came to talks in Saudi Arabia eager to make up and had proposed a partial truce on air and sea attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's advisers pressed for more and said Ukraine agreed to their proposal for a full month-long ceasefire in a war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we made an offer that the Ukrainians have accepted, which is to enter into a ceasefire and into immediate negotiations," US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after around nine hours of talks in an ornate hotel in Jeddah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll take this offer now to the Russians and we hope they'll say yes to peace. The ball is now in their court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they say no then we'll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here," Rubio said of Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbour in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said the United States would immediately resume military assistance and intelligence sharing it had cut off to pressure its wartime partner following a disastrous February 28 meeting between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington, Trump said he was ready to welcome Zelensky back to the White House and may speak to President Vladimir Putin this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by a reporter about the prospects of a comprehensive ceasefire in Ukraine, Trump answered: "Well, I hope it will be over the next few days, I'd like to see.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know we have a big meeting with Russia tomorrow and some great conversations hopefully will ensue."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement, Ukraine and the United States said they would conclude "as soon as possible" a deal securing US access to Ukraine's mineral wealth, which Trump demanded as compensation for billions of dollars in US weapons under his predecessor Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was supposed to sign the deal at the White House before the dramatic on-camera showdown, in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance dressed down the wartime leader and accused him of ingratitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky quickly thanked Trump over the "positive" ceasefire proposal made in Jeddah and said the United States must now work to persuade Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The American side understands our arguments, perceives our proposals, and I want to thank President Trump for the constructive conversation between our teams," Zelensky said in his evening address.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the US cutoff of aid and intelligence sharing, Russia has stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and seized back land in Russia's Kursk region which Ukrainian forces had infiltrated as they seek leverage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours before the Jeddah talks, Ukraine staged a major direct attack on Moscow, with hundreds of drones slamming into the capital and other areas, leaving three people dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak said in Jeddah that Ukraine had made clear that its desire is peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Russia needs to say, very clearly, they want peace or not, they want to end this war, which they started, or no," Yermak told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's abrupt shift on Ukraine following Biden's strong support has rattled European allies, with France and Germany increasingly speaking of developing common European defence if the United States no longer offers its security guarantees through Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Mike Waltz, Trump's national security advisor, countered that the brash president has "literally moved the entire global conversation" in support of peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've gone from if the war is going to end to how the war is going to end," Waltz told reporters alongside Rubio.
  <br>
  <br>
  Waltz, who said he would speak in the coming days with his Russian counterpart, credited the Ukrainians with agreeing on the need to "end the killing, to end the tragic meat-grinder of people and national treasure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio will head Wednesday to Canada -- another country with which Trump is feuding -- to meet fellow foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrial democracies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio has said he will push the G7 to avoid "antagonistic" language about Russia for fear of scuttling diplomacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Poland, a top supporter of Ukraine and where historical memories of Russia run deep, Prime Minister Donald Tusk praised the "important step towards peace" by the United States and Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even if Russia agrees to a ceasefire, much remains uncertain in negotiations. Ukraine has pressed for security guarantees, but Trump, in another shift from Biden, has ruled out Nato membership.
  <br>
  <br>
  Waltz said that the talks in Jeddah discussed "substantive details on how this war is going to permanently end" including "what type of guarantees they're going to have for their long term security and prosperity".
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron, who has mulled European forces in Ukraine as part of any deal, said Tuesday that Kyiv needs "credible" security guarantees in any ceasefire. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A plane carrying former Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte left the Philippine capital bound for The Hague on Tuesday following his arrest on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant stemming from his deadly crackdown on drugs, Manila said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old faces a charge of "the crime against humanity of murder", according to the ICC, for a crackdown that rights groups estimate killed tens of thousands of mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Ferdinand Marcos Junior told a press briefing that the plane carrying his predecessor had departed at 11:03 pm (1503 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  "The plane is en route to The Hague in the Netherlands allowing the former president to face charges of crimes against humanity in relation to his bloody war on drugs," said Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was arrested at Manila's international airport Tuesday after "Interpol Manila received the official copy of the warrant of the arrest from the ICC", the presidential palace said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His daughter, current Vice President Sara Duterte, said he was being "forcibly taken to The Hague".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not justice – this is oppression and persecution," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte had earlier taken to social media to say he believed the Philippine Supreme Court would step in and prevent his transfer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Supreme Court will not agree to that. We do not have an extradition treaty," he said on Instagram live after his lawyers filed a petition.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ICC spokesman confirmed the arrest warrant on Tuesday and said an initial appearance hearing would be scheduled when Duterte was in court custody. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistani insurgents attacked a passenger train in a tunnel and claimed to have taken over 100 hostages on Tuesday, as authorities struggled to reach the remote area. The fate of the estimated 500 people aboard was not immediately clear.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the attackers blew up the railroad track in restive southwestern Balochistan province and exchanged fire with security guards aboard the train.
  <br>
  <br>
  The train was travelling from the provincial capital of Quetta to the northern city of Peshawar when it came under attack in Bolan district, government spokesman Shahid Rind said, calling it “an act of terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ambulances were dispatched, but access was not easy due to the rugged, mountainous terrain, Rind said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The separatist Baloch Liberation Army, which has waged a years-long insurgency, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it took over 100 hostages, including security forces who were on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials at Pakistan Railways said the Jafar Express train was carrying an estimated 500 passengers, including women and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three security officials said the BLA, which Pakistan and the United States have designated a terrorist organisation, ambushed the train inside a tunnel and used women and children as human shields. They said troops have launched an operation to rescue the hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trains in Balochistan typically have security personnel on board. Separatists have previously carried out deadly attacks on trains in the region. In November, a separatist group carried out a suicide bombing at a train station in Quetta that killed 26 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest and least populated province. It is a hub for the country’s ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. (AP)

 US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he would double incoming steel and aluminium tariffs on Canadian imports from 25 percent to 50 percent, adding that these would take effect "tomorrow morning".
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump – in the statement which comes after the Canadian province of Ontario imposed an electricity surcharge on three US states – also threatened to "substantially increase" tariffs on cars coming into the United States on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the further tariffs would "permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revived threats that the country would become "our cherished Fifty First State". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine said talks with the United States in Saudi Arabia began "very constructively" on Tuesday, with a partial ceasefire with Russia on the table hours after Kyiv conducted its largest drone attack on Moscow in three years of war.
 <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga attended the meeting in Jeddah – which Russia was not participating in – as President Donald Trump ramped up pressure on Ukraine to end the war that began with Russia's 2022 assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks come just days after President Volodymyr Zelensky's public dressing-down at the White House, after which the United States cut off military aid, intelligence sharing and access to satellite imagery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine is hoping the offer of a partial ceasefire in the sky and at sea will persuade Washington to restore the assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to do everything to achieve peace," Ukrainian presidency chief of staff Andriy Yermak told reporters as he entered Tuesday's meeting at a luxury hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv officials said the "largest drone attack in history," in which hundreds of drones slammed into Moscow and other areas overnight, was intended to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to the aerial and naval ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an additional signal to Putin that he should also be interested in a ceasefire in the air," said Andriy Kovalenko, a national security council official responsible for countering disinformation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three people were killed in the attack, which both sides said was the biggest so far on Moscow. Russia's army said it intercepted 337 drones around the country. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A bus overturned in an area of Johannesburg near South Africa's main airport early on Tuesday, killing at least 16 people, city officials said, with dozens more injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  The bus was carrying more than 50 people to work when it crashed on a busy road near Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said the crash "has so far claimed 16 lives." Twelve died at the scene and four more in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the accident, which forced the closure of the highway leading to the airport, was not immediately known. Images from the scene showed the bus on its side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Preliminary investigations showed that the vehicle swerved, rolled and landed facing the direction from which it came, RTMC spokesman Simon Zwane said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials had earlier put the tally of people hurt at 45.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are lost for words. This is a disaster," Ekurhuleni city transport official Andile Mngwevu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A survivor of the accident told Newzroom Afrika television that the bus appeared to be speeding.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 11,800 lives were lost on South African roads in 2023, most of them pedestrians, according to the latest data from RTMC. (AFP)

File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795258_1_20250311160751.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Tuesday it hoped a "just and lasting solution" can be found to the three-year war between Ukraine and Russia, ahead of talks that will involve Ukrainian and US officials in Saudi Arabia.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China supports all efforts that contribute to a peaceful resolution of the crisis," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning when asked about the talks at a regular news conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect and hope that parties can reach a just and lasting solution that is acceptable to all sides," said Mao.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is also willing to continue to work with the international community to play a constructive role for a political resolution of the crisis," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks in Saudi Arabia will be the most senior since a disastrous White House visit last month when US President Donald Trump berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for purported ingratitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ahead of the talks between Ukrainian and US officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting in Jeddah, the crown prince underscored the kingdom's support for international efforts to resolve Ukraine's crisis and achieving peace, the Saudi state news agency SPA reported early on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, once Ukraine's main ally, has upended its policy on the conflict in its stated pursuit of a rapid end to the fighting, engaging directly with Moscow while stopping military assistance and intelligence sharing for Ukraine.

    Arab nations condemn Israel's Gaza electricity cut

<img alt="The Southern Gaza Desalination plant has stopped working after Israel cut off electricity supply to the Gaza Strip. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795253_1_20250311152458.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan on Tuesday condemned Israel's decision to cut electricity supply to the war-battered Gaza Strip, calling in separate statements for the international community to take action.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced on Sunday it was disconnecting the only power line to a water desalination plant in Gaza, in an effort to pressure Palestinian militant group Hamas into releasing hostages amid an apparent impasse in truce talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed "condemnation in the strongest terms of the Israeli occupation authorities' use of collective punishment against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by cutting off electricity to the area".
  <br>
  <br>
  A Qatari foreign ministry statement said the Gulf state "strongly condemns the Israeli occupation's act of cutting electricity to the Gaza Strip, considering it a blatant violation of international humanitarian law".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordanian foreign ministry spokesman Sufyan Qudah called the electricity cut "a clear continuation of the policy of starvation and siege imposed by Israel", about a week after Israeli authorities blocked the entry of aid into Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations has warned of "dire consequences" for Gaza's population, while Britain said it was "deeply concerned" by the Israeli move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia called on the international community to "take urgent actions immediately", while Qatar also urged "immediate action to provide the necessary protection for the Palestinian people".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan's Qudah called on the world "to assume its legal and moral responsibilities, and oblige Israel to continue with the ceasefire agreement... restore electricity to Gaza" and reopen border crossings for aid deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli negotiators were expected to hold talks with mediators in Qatar, part of efforts to extend a fragile truce since January that has largely halted the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. (AFP)

    Ex-Philippine president Duterte arrested in Manila

<img alt="Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was arrested after landing in Manila from Hong Kong. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795225_1_20250311113948.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by police at Manila's international airport on Tuesday on the order of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him, the Philippine government said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The office of the Philippine president said Duterte was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating the mass killings that happened under the former president's deadly crackdown against illegal drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC launched an investigation into drug killings under Duterte from November 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability over the killings.
  <br>
  <br>
  His administration moved to suspend the global court’s investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC – a court of last resort – did not have jurisdiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in July 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration’s objections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asks international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  China on Tuesday warned the ICC against "politicisation" and "double standards", after Duterte’s arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has noted the relevant information and is closely monitoring the development of the situation," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a briefing in Beijing when asked about the arrest. (Agencies)

    Carney vows 'quick' transition to new government

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada's incoming prime minister Mark Carney has promised a "smooth" and "quick" transition from Justin Trudeau after his convincing win in the ruling Liberal Party's leadership race.
 <br>
  <br>
  But speaking on,
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Professor Al Reyes of the University of Hong Kong told Carol Musgrave that Carney's tough position on President Donald Trump meant that relations between the US and Canada would continue to be fraught.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He made very clear that the retaliatory tariffs that he imposed would remain until there is stability or at least some resolution to the current tariff war, so one can expect 'Trumpy times'... they've been already fraught under [Justin] Trudeau and these waning days, I think they will continue to be once [Mark] Carney takes over," Reyes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming general election will be a major test for Carney, a former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, who has never served in parliament nor held any elected public office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He does not have a seat in parliament. That's one reason why it would be more likely that a general election would be called very soon, because he has to get a seat in parliament... I think the key challenges for him, not just trying to figure out how to deal with the United States, but also what are the alternatives in terms of trade and investment if relations with the United States are so difficult."
  <br>
  <br>
  Reyes added that domestically, the cost of housing, eliminating the carbon tax and immigration would be key issues for Carney going forward.

    Arrest of pro-Palestinian student sparks outrage

<img alt="A demonstrator is detained by police officers during a protest following the arrest by US immigration agents of Palestinian student protester Mahmoud Khalil, in New York City. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795219_1_20250311105218.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Protesters in New York and rights groups expressed outrage on Monday over the arrest of a leader of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University, as President Donald Trump vowed further crackdowns.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate and one of the most prominent faces of the university's high-profile protests, was arrested by US immigration officials over the weekend despite holding a permanent residency green card.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Homeland Security, confirming Khalil's arrest on Sunday, claimed he had "led activities aligned to Hamas" and that the DHS action was taken "in coordination with the Department of State."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it," the president wrote on Monday on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the first arrest of many to come," he pledged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protests at Columbia, launched last year in opposition to Israel's devastating war in Gaza, brought widespread media attention as tensions mounted on campus and spread to other universities around the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and other Republicans have broadly accused the protesters of supporting Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Trump administration moves to quickly deport Khalil, who has reportedly been moved to the southern state of Louisiana, a federal judge on Monday ordered authorities to halt proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) condemned Khalil's arrest, calling it "unprecedented, illegal, and un-American."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government's actions are obviously intended to intimidate and chill speech on one side of a public debate," said Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday afternoon, over 1,000 protesters gathered in New York to express their outrage at Khalil's arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was essentially a kidnapping," said 42-year-old Tobi, who declined to give her last name for fear of retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems like a clear targeting of activists, which is a really, really dangerous precedent," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK coastguard ended the search for a missing crew member after a cargo ship ran into a US-military charted tanker carrying jet fuel in the North Sea on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  HM Coastguard rescued 36 crew members from the Stena Immaculate tanker and Solong container vessel, with one taken to hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One crew member of the Solong remains unaccounted for. After an extensive search for the missing crew member sadly they have not been found and the search has ended," said Matthew Atkinson, Divisional Commander for HM Coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Images showed a huge plume of thick, black smoke and flames rising from the scene about 16 kilometres off the east England coast, sparking concerns of "multiple toxic hazards".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Stena Immaculate tanker was "anchored off the North Sea coast near Hull...
  <br>
  [and] was struck by the container ship Solong", the Stena's US-based operators Crowley said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Stena was on a short-term US military charter with Military Sealift Command, according to Jillian Morris, the spokesperson for the command that operates civilian-crewed ships providing ocean transport for the US Defense Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowley said the impact of the collision "ruptured" the tanker "containing A1-jet fuel" and triggered a fire, with fuel "reported released".
  <br>
  <br>
  It was carrying around 220,000 barrels of jet fuel while the Solong was carrying 15 containers of sodium cyanide, according to the Lloyd's List information service, but it is not known if any of the flammable compound had leaked.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two vessels were still on fire 12 hours after the collision, said the coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the situation "extremely concerning".
  <br>
  <br>
  All crew members aboard the Stena Immaculate were confirmed to be alive, a spokeswoman for the tanker's Swedish owner, Stena Bulk, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alarm about the crash near the port city of Hull in East Yorkshire was raised at 0948 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  A coastguard helicopter, a plane, lifeboats from four towns and other nearby vessels were part of the large rescue operation, UK Coastguard said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 25 people were killed in two separate bus crashes in Mexico on Monday, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the country's north, 14 people died in a fiery collision between a tractor-trailer and a bus carrying passengers from the US state of Texas, civil protection authorities in Durango state said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 24 people travelling in the bus, only 10 managed to get out alive, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In southern Mexico, a bus turned over along a highway in Oaxaca state, killing 11 people, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twelve others were taken to the hospital with injuries, two of them in critical condition, the Oaxaca state government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I extend my heartfelt condolences to the victims' families, to whom we will provide the necessary support and assistance during this difficult time," Oaxaca Governor Salomon Jara said on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a interview on local radio on Monday afternoon, the state's interior minister, Jesus Romero, said the bus was carrying more than 40 people and was en route to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico's south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romero said it seemed that the passengers were heading home after attending a rally held on Sunday by President Claudia Sheinbaum in the capital Mexico City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities will launch an investigation into the cause of the accident, which happened near the community of Santo Domingo Narro, it said. (Agencies)

    Musk claims X targeted in 'massive cyberattack'

<img alt="More than 40,000 users reported having no access to the platform, according to the tracking website Downdetector.com. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795191_1_20250311082846.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk said his social media platform, X, has been targeted in a “massive cyberattack", hours after a series of outages on Monday left it unavailable to thousands of users.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources," Musk claimed in a post. "Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing..."
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Monday, Musk said on Fox Business Network’s Kudlow that the attackers had “IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area" without going into detail on what this might mean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cybersecurity experts quickly pointed out, however, that this doesn't necessarily mean that an attack originated in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security researcher Kevin Beaumont said on Bluesky that Musk's claim is “missing a key fact - it was actually IPs from worldwide, not just Ukraine.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, he said it was a Mirai variant botnet, which is made of compromised cameras. He said while he is not sure who is behind the attack, it “Smells of APTs - advanced persistent teenagers.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Allan Liska of the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, meanwhile, pointed out that even if “every IP address that hit Twitter today originated from Ukraine (doubtful), they were most likely compromised machines controlled by a botnet run by a third party that could be located anywhere in the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 40,000 users reported having no access to the platform, according to the tracking website Downdetector.com. By Monday afternoon, the reports had dropped to the low thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sustained outage that lasted at least an hour began at noon, with the heaviest disruptions occurring along the US coasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Downdetector.com said that 56 percent of problems were reported for the X app, while 33 percent were reported for the website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk bought the former Twitter in 2022 and also serves as the CEO of Tesla. (AP)

    EU says US not engaging to make deal to avoid tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States does not appear to want to make a deal with Brussels to avoid hefty tariffs against the EU, the bloc's trade chief said on Monday, days before US steel and aluminium levies kick in.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US administration does not seem to be engaging to make a deal," said Maros Sefcovic, who travelled to Washington last month in the hopes of reaching an agreement to avert a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump has taken aim squarely at the European Union, charging last month that the bloc was formed "to screw" the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Trump's 25-percent tariffs across steel and aluminium imports are due to take effect, affecting the EU as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea and other trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU has said it will respond firmly if the levies come into force.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US is watching over their interest, so is the European Union. Therefore, we will always protect European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified tariffs because we know that they expect no less from us," Sefcovic told reporters in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trade commissioner stressed that the EU remained open to dialogue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to have a constructive and positive relationship with the United States of America. And therefore, I would highlight once again that our doors are open for constructive engagement," Sefcovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also insisted the "overall picture" showed EU-US trade relations were balanced and mutually beneficial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States is Europe's largest investor, and vice versa, with US$5.7 trillion worth of investment in each others' markets based on 2022 data, according to EU figures. (AFP)

<img alt="A man walks outside at the Southern Gaza Desalination plant, which stopped working earlier after Israel cut off electricity supply to the Gaza Strip. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795152_1_20250310203138.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel is due to send a delegation to Qatar on Monday for a fresh round of talks on extending a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, after cutting off the electricity supply to the besieged enclave.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the deal expired at the beginning of March with no agreement on subsequent stages that should secure a lasting end to Israel's war in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas accused Israel of reneging on the ceasefire deal, saying in a statement on Monday Israel "refuses to commence the second phase, exposing its intentions of evasion and stalling".
  <br>
  <br>
  Media reports said a top official from the domestic security agency Shin Bet will lead Israel's delegation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has halted aid deliveries to Gaza amid the deadlock, and on Sunday announced it was cutting off the territory's electricity supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will use all the tools at our disposal to bring back the hostages and ensure that Hamas is no longer in Gaza the day after" the war, Energy Minister Eli Cohen said as he ordered the power cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move echoed the early days of the war when Israel announced a "complete siege" on the Palestinian territory, severing the electricity supply which was only restored in mid-2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanoua said Israel's move will impact its hostages still held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The decision to cut electricity is a failed option and poses a threat to its (Israeli) prisoners, who will only be freed through negotiations," Qanoua said in a statement on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany criticised Israel on Monday for its latest decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign ministry spokeswoman Kathrin Deschauer said Gaza was "again threatened with a food shortage" and that cutting off electricity was "unacceptable and not compatible with (Israel's) obligations under international law". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia said on Monday it was expelling two British "diplomats" on suspicion of carrying out espionage activities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russia's FSB security service said "counterintelligence work had revealed an undeclared British intelligence presence under the cover of the national embassy".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it was expelling the embassy's second secretary, whom it named as Alkesh Odedra, and the husband of the first secretary of the embassy's political department, identified as Michael Skinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both had "deliberately provided false information when obtaining a permit to enter our country, thus violating Russian legislation", the FSB said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian foreign ministry has revoked their accreditations and ordered them to leave Russia within two weeks, the FSB said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK blasted the move as unfounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the first time that Russia has made malicious and baseless accusations against our staff," a UK foreign ministry spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's foreign ministry also summoned an embassy representative in connection with the allegations, it said in a post on Telegram.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Moscow and London have been strained by intelligence scandals throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin years in power. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea fired "multiple unidentified ballistic missiles" on Monday, South Korea's military said, the same day Seoul and Washington began a major annual joint military drill known as Freedom Shield.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Our military has detected at around 4.50am GMT multiple unidentified ballistic missiles fired from Hwanghae province," the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our military will bolster surveillance and maintain a full readiness posture under close cooperation with the United States," the JCS added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States stations tens of thousands of US soldiers in South Korea, and the allies regularly stage joint drills, which they describe as defensive in nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such exercises infuriate Pyongyang, which regards them as rehearsals for invasion and routinely responds with weapons tests of its own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Monday, the nuclear-armed North slammed the drills as a "provocative act", warning of the danger of sparking war with "an accidental single shot".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a dangerous provocative act of leading the acute situation on the Korean peninsula, which may spark off a physical conflict between the two sides by means of an accidental single shot," said Pyongyang's foreign ministry, according to the Korean Central News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint US-South Korea "Freedom Shield 2025" exercise kicked off on Monday, and will involve "live, virtual, and field-based training", according to a US statement. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An analyst on Monday agreed with Foreign Minister Wang Yi's statement at the "Two Sessions" last week that China ensured global stability.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zoon Ahmed Khan, a research fellow at the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, said on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">

  , that the uncertainty from trade disputes between the world's major trading powers was creating instability, and that China was positioned to provide a steady hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world needs more certainty, the world needs more cooperation, he [Wang Yi] also mentioned the importance of multilateralism and upholding the UN system which is something that resonates with the vast majority of the world," Khan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sino-US trade tensions, Khan warned US President Donald Trump's tariffs could backfire on America.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These have not benefited the United States... he [Wang Yi] specifically mentioned that the US has to reflect, first of all, what has the impact of increased tariffs been on their own economy, on their own development."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The first major global effort to crack down on the fast-growing industry of scamming is turning into a growing humanitarian crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  While a dramatic and highly-publicised operation by the Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities has led to the release of more than 7,000 people from online scam compounds in Myanmar, for many it is the beginning of another nightmare.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a month after the crackdown began, thousands of people are still detained in Myanmar, kept in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions by the armed groups that arranged their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Associated Press obtained exclusive photos of people squatting in rows, stacked against each other, surgical masks covering some of their eyes and mouths.
  <br>
  <br>
  In clandestine calls, survivors say they fear for their lives as illness is rampant and conditions are unsafe.

  They sleep on floors in army camps or former scam compounds guarded by armed militia groups. In one army camp, 800 people are sharing 10 toilets, one survivor said.

  Getting home is dependent on the resources available by country.

  China sent a chartered flight to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up its citizens, but few other governments have matched that.

  There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting on a Thai military base, stuck for want of a US$600 plane ticket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their plight has drawn concern from the US State Department and demands for their release from international human rights organisations, but Thai officials won't allow people to cross the border until their home countries arrange for them to leave immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are a handful of advocacy groups operating at the border helping.

  Thailand is working with embassies to coordinate the release and handover of people, but said it can only handle up to 300 people per day, down from 500 initially.

  Gangs running illegal scams have trapped hundreds of thousands of people in locked compounds in Myanmar, Cambodia and other places in Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victims say they were lured with promises of lucrative jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks.

  As outrage grew in China following the kidnapping of a young actor, Beijing pressured authorities in Thailand and Myanmar to act.

  The Thai government cut off power and electricity, and government-aligned armed groups that control areas near Myanmar's border with Thailand released several thousand people from scam centres. But no bosses were arrested. (AP)

 US President Donald Trump declined on Sunday to rule out the possibility that the United States might enter a recession this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I hate to predict things like that," he told a Fox News interviewer when asked directly about a possible recession in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big - we're bringing wealth back to America," he said, adding, "It takes a little time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, was more definitive when asked on Sunday about the possibility of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Absolutely not," he told NBC's "Meet the Press" when asked whether Americans should brace for a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's on-again, off-again tariff threats against Canada, Mexico, China and others have left the US financial markets in turmoil and consumers unsure what the year might bring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock markets just ended their worst week since the November election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measures of consumer confidence are down, as shoppers - already battered by years of inflation - brace for the higher prices that tariffs can bring.
  <br>
  <br>
  And widespread government lay-offs being engineered by Trump's billionaire advisor Elon Musk add further concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked later on Sunday to clarify his remarks on whether there could be a recession, Trump told reports on Air Force One "Who knows?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the signs are mixed.
  <br>
  <br>
  A widely-watched Atlanta Federal Reserve index now predicts a 2.4 percent contraction of real GDP growth in the year's first quarter, which would be the worst result since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists at Goldman Sachs, citing Trump's policies, have raised their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15 percent to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Morgan Stanley predicted "softer growth this year" than earlier expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recessions are generally defined as two consecutive quarters of weak or negative GDP growth.
