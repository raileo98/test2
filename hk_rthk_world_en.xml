<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's CK Hutchison on Tuesday agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, following intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$22.8 billion sale, which also includes dozens of ports in other countries, appeared to be a win for Trump's aggressive diplomacy just hours before he is due to tout the successes of the first six tumultuous weeks of his second term in an address to the US Congress. Trump had refused to rule out military action to assert US control over the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has complained about the presence of Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong-based companies in Panama, while US officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison's control of ports at both entrances of the canal represents a security risk for the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of licenses will result in the consortium gaining a 90 percent stake in Panama Ports Company, which has been the operator of the Balboa and Cristobal ports in the Central American country for more than two decades, CK Hutchison said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock has briefed the White House and Congressional leadership on the deal, a person familiar with the transaction said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would be BlackRock's largest infrastructure investment to date, that person said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department, White House, National Security Council and Panama's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  CK Hutchison is a publicly listed company not financially tied to the Chinese government, though Hong Kong firms are subject to state oversight. Other ports in Panama are operated by companies from the US, and Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's authorities have announced an audit of CK Hutchison's contract, saying they are investigating its compliance with concession agreements. Panama's attorney general determined earlier this month that CK Hutchison's port contract was "unconstitutional." The Supreme Court was to have had the last word on its legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made his first overseas trip as top U.S. diplomat to Latin America last month, including to Panama, where he pressured the country over China's presence along the canal. After his departure, Rubio hailed Panama's decision to exit China's Belt and Road infrastructure plan, and he has expressed optimism in media interviews that Hutchison would not own the ports in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of Panama ports licenses held by the unit of billionaire Li Ka-shing's conglomerate to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment will give it control of an 80 percent interest in Hutchison Ports for an equity value of US$14.21 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will get control of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries while delivering cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion for the Hong Kong-based consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale does not involve any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, as well as South China, or any other ports in Mainland China, CK Hutchison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consortium has agreed that negotiations will be on an exclusive basis for a period of 145 days, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock completed the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for approximately US$12.5 billion in cash and stock last October. At the time, chairman and CEO Larry Fink described infrastructure as “a generational investment opportunity.” (Reuters)

    EU chief unveils US$840 billion 'rearm' plan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday presented a five-part plan to mobilise some US$844 billion for Europe's defence, and help provide "immediate" military support for Ukraine after Washington suspended military aid.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move came hours after US President Donald Trump announced the aid freeze, intensifying Washington's push for a peace deal with Russia and confirming its pivot away from its European allies and partners in backing Kyiv's war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new era is upon us," the European Commission president said in a letter presenting the plan to EU leaders, two days before a summit aimed at cementing joint action on support for Ukraine and boosting Europe's defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Rearm Europe' could mobilise close to US$844 billion of defence expenditures for a safe and resilient Europe," von der Leyen told reporters as she outlined the plan, which includes a US$158 billion loan facility along with steps to free up large-scale defence investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear how fast funds could be made available under the proposals, which need approval by member states, nor how quickly this could translate into battlefield support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  It proposes that the EU ease strict budget rules, which oblige states to keep public deficits below three percent of gross domestic product, to allow them to ramp up spending on defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondly, the plan calls for a new "instrument" to provide US$157 billion of loans to member states for defence investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are talking about pan-European capability domains - for example, air and missile defence, artillery systems, missiles and ammunition drones and anti-drone systems," said von der Leyen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's Brussels summit, after weekend crisis talks also involving Britain and Nato, comes as Europe contemplates the prospect of the United States withdrawing longer-term support from Ukraine and more broadly from its European allies. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China vowed on Tuesday to fight to the "bitter end" if the United States pushes a trade war, after Washington and Beijing exchanged a salvo of tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing up to 15 percent increases to import levies covering a range of American agricultural and food products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also placed 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's countermeasures are to protect its own rights and interests, Lin told a regular press conference, urging Washington to return to dialogue and cooperation as soon as possible. (Agencies)

 Canada will slap tariffs on US imports beginning on Tuesday in response to levies pledged by President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday, adding "there is no justification" for Washington's actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12.01am EST tomorrow, respond with 25 percent tariffs against US$155 billion of American goods," the Canadian prime minister said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steep US tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods came into effect Tuesday as a deadline to avert President Donald Trump's levies passed without the North American neighbours striking a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian goods will face a 25 percent tariff -- with energy resources hit by a lower 10 percent rate -- while Mexican products face a 25 percent blanket levy, according to orders Trump previously signed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a lack of progress in tackling drug trafficking as he pushed ahead with the duties. (AFP)

    US 'pauses' military aid to Ukraine

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump has paused military aid to Ukraine following his clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official said, deepening the fissure that has opened between the two one-time allies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move comes after Trump upended US policy on Ukraine and Russia upon taking office in January, adopting a more conciliatory stance towards Moscow - and after an explosive confrontation with Zelensky at the White House on Friday in which Trump criticiSed him for being insufficiently grateful for Washington's support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution," said a White House official.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House had no immediate comment on the scope and amount of aid affected or how long the pause would last.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pentagon could not provide further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment nor did the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Trump again said Zelensky should be more appreciative of American support after earlier responding angrily to an Associated Press report quoting Zelensky as saying the end of the war is "very, very far away."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer!" Trump wrote on Truth Social. (Reuters)

    SpaceX calls off Starship test flight at last minute

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's SpaceX called off the latest test flight of its Starship rocket just before its scheduled launch on Monday, citing an unspecified problem with the behemoth spacecraft.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Standing down from today's flight test attempt," SpaceX posted on X, also owned by Musk. "Starship team is determining the next best available opportunity to fly."
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest and most powerful rocket was set to take off with no crew at 6:45pm local time from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rescheduled launch has yet to be announced, though SpaceX employee Dan Huot said it was expected "to be about 24 hours" during a live feed of the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight will be Starship's eighth orbital mission overall and first since a dramatic mid-air explosion over the Caribbean during its last trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standing 123 metres tall, Starship is designed to eventually be fully reusable and plays a crucial role in Musk and SpaceX's vision of colonising Mars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Nasa is awaiting a modified version of the rocket for its Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Federal Aviation Administration grounded Starship after its previous flight on January 16 ended with the upper stage disintegrating in a fiery cascade over the Turks and Caicos Islands, prompting clean-up efforts for fallen debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the upcoming flight, SpaceX says it has introduced numerous upgrades to the upper-stage spacecraft, enhancing its reliability and performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission, expected to last just over an hour, includes another attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower's "chopstick" arms – a feat SpaceX has successfully executed twice, including in the last flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the first commercial mission of Europe's new heavy-lift rocket Ariane 6 was called off minutes before it was scheduled to launch, due to an "anomaly" on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest of several postponements for the rocket as Europe seeks to secure independent access to space. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new round of negotiations for an international treaty on reducing global plastics pollution will be held in Geneva in August, the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A previous round of negotiations – tasked with hammering out a legally binding treaty – ended without agreement in South Korea last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trenches, and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on the Unep website of the new talks comes in the wake of a last-ditch Cop16 finance deal on biodiversity agreed in Rome last week by delegates from some 150 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unep said the new plastics talks will be held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva from August 5 to 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  December's South Korea talks broke down following opposition from a bloc of mainly oil-producing countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from nearly 200 nations debated for a week on how to stop millions of tonnes of plastic waste from entering the environment each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks were meant to end with the world's first accord on cutting plastics pollution after nearly two years of discussions, but concluded without an agreement – except to extend talks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 60 per cent of all adults and a third of all children in the world will be overweight or obese by 2050 unless governments take action, a large new study said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The research published in the Lancet medical journal used data from 204 countries to paint a grim picture of what it described as one of the great health challenges of the century.

  "The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure," lead author Emmanuela Gakidou, from the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of overweight or obese people worldwide rose from 929 million in 1990 to 2.6 billion in 2021, the study found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without a serious change, the researchers estimate that 3.8 billion adults will be overweight or obese in 15 years - or around 60 per cent of the global adult population in 2050.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's health systems will come under crippling pressure, the researchers warned, with around a quarter of the world's obese expected to be aged over 65 by that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also predicted a 121-per cent increase in obesity among children and adolescents around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third of all obese young people will be living in two regions - North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America and the Caribbean - by 2050, the researchers warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is not too late to act, said study co-author Jessica Kerr from Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Much stronger political commitment is needed to transform diets within sustainable global food systems," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That commitment was also needed for strategies "that improve people's nutrition, physical activity and living environments, whether it's too much processed food or not enough parks," Kerr said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than half the world's overweight or obese adults already live in just eight countries - China, India, the United States, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Indonesia and Egypt, the study said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The research is based on figures from the Global Burden of Disease study from the IHME, which brings together thousands of researchers across the world and is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Monday that 25 percent taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada would start on Tuesday, sparking renewed fears of a North American trade war that already showed signs of pushing up inflation and hindering growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  “Tomorrow - tariffs 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico. And that’ll start,” Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room. “They’re going to have to have a tariff.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has said the tariffs are to force the two US neighbours to step up their fight against fentanyl trafficking and stop illegal immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump has also indicated that he wants to eliminate the Americas' trade imbalances as well and push more factories to relocate in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments quickly rattled the US stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the Trump administration remains confident that tariffs are the best choice to boost US manufacturing and attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump provided a one-month delay in February as both Mexico and Canada promised concessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said that there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to avoid the steep new tariffs, which were also set to tax Canadian energy products, such as oil and electricity, at a lower 10 per cent rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If Trump is imposing tariffs, we are ready," said Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joly said Canada had a very strong border plan and explained that to Trump administration officials last week. She said diplomatic efforts were continuing. She spoke after Trump made his comments on Tuesday. (AP)

 A car driven into a crowd in the German city of Mannheim on Monday killed one person and injured several, police said, adding that one person had been arrested.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We can now confirm that a car was driven into a pedestrian zone and that one person was killed," said police spokesman Stefan Wilhelm, adding that several people were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that one suspect was arrested," he said, adding that "the investigation is continuing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilhelm said residents had been urged "to avoid the inner city area" after the emergency sparked a large-scale police operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police with heavy weapons cordoned off the area and police helicopters were seen in the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  A reporter for news channel NTV reported that "at least one person is lying covered under a tarpaulin".
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany has in recent months suffered a spate of violent attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month a man drove a car into a trade union demonstration in the southern city of Munich, killing a two-year-old girl and her mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December a car-ramming attack targeted a Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg, killing six people and wounding hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mannheim itself was the scene of a stabbing attack at an anti-Islam rally last May in which a policeman was killed and five others were wounded. (AFP)

    Haifa attacker was Israeli Druze minority

<img alt="Members of Israeli security and emergency services transport the body of the reported attacker in Haifa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794029_1_20250303192453.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's police said the perpetrator of a stabbing attack in the northern city of Haifa on Monday was a member of Israel's Druze Arab minority who recently returned from abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Druze are an ethno-religious minority among the Arab citizens of Israel, who's roots in the region go back centuries. They make up roughly 5.5 percent of Lebanon's population, 3 percent of Syria and 1.6 percent of Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came one day after Israel blocked aid to the Gaza Strip during an impasse over extending the truce in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, a prominent Druze leader in Lebanon said on Sunday that he will soon visit Syria to meet its interim leader as tensions simmer between members of the minority group, the war-torn country’s interim government, and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The free Syrians must be cautious of the plots of Israel,” veteran Druze leader Walid Jumblatt said at a news conference Sunday, accusing Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of creating sectarian division and chaos in the country. “In Syria there is a plot for sabotage. There is a plot for sabotage in the region and for the Arabs’ national security.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-week first phase of the truce ended at the weekend. It had enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance to Gaza. The Israeli decision prompted the United Nations to call on Israel for an immediate restoration of the aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany also urged Israel to resume aid flow "immediately".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel's army said it struck on Monday a "suspicious motorised vessel" off the coast of south Gaza's Khan Yunis. (Agencies)

 "Anora", the story of a sex worker who gets a chance at a new life when she marries a wealthy client on a whim, won five Academy Awards on Sunday, including the coveted best picture Oscar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The movie's 25-year-old star, Mikey Madison, was named best actress. The film also won best director for Sean Baker and trophies for original screenplay and editing.

   Baker, 53, wrote, produced, directed and edited the film, and he swept in all four categories.

    Israel blocks humanitarian aid into Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Sunday blocked aid flowing into Gaza, where a six-week truce enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance, prompting the UN to call for an immediate restoration of humanitarian assistance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli decision came as talks on a truce extension appeared to hit an impasse, after the ceasefire's 42-day first phase drew to a close.
  <br>
  <br>
  Truce mediators Egypt and Qatar accused Israel of blatantly violating the ceasefire deal by halting the aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Sunday, Israel had announced a truce extension until mid-April that it said United States Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hamas has repeatedly rejected an extension, instead favouring a transition to the truce deal's second phase that could bring a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With uncertainty looming over the truce, both Israel and Palestinian sources reported Israeli military strikes in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, whose health ministry reported at least four people killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the fighting, said the "decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the [ceasefire] agreement".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as "a weapon against the Palestinian people", comments echoed by Qatar which said it "strongly condemns" Israel's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, which has rejected any talk of normalising ties with Israel without a Palestinian state, condemned the aid block as "a tool of blackmail and collective punishment".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan said Israel's action "threatens to reignite" fighting in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres called for "humanitarian aid to flow back into Gaza immediately".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union condemned what it called Hamas's refusal to accept the extension of the first phase, and added that Israel's subsequent aid block "risked humanitarian consequences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels called for "a rapid resumption of negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European leaders closed ranks on Sunday in support of Kyiv at a London summit, where they pledged to spend more on security and assemble a coalition to defend any truce in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  And French President Emmanuel Macron, flying back from the summit, said in a newspaper interview that France and Britain wanted to propose a partial one-month truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks, which brought together 18 allies, came just two days after US President Donald Trump berated his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in front of reporters at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Britain, France "and others" would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, which they would then put to Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London meeting came at a delicate moment for war-battered Ukraine, facing uncertain US backing and on the back foot against Russia's three-year war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's row with Zelensky also raised fresh questions over the US commitment to Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said Europe found itself "at a crossroads in history".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a moment for more talk - it's time to act. It's time to step up and lead and unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  With no guarantee of US involvement, "Europe must do the heavy lifting", Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several countries were ready to help defend any truce, he added - without naming them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron, in an interview with France's Le Figaro newspaper, said he and Starmer were working on a one-month truce in Ukraine, "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was warmly embraced by many of the world leaders at the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the UK leader's Downing Street home, people gathered to show their support for Ukraine, some dressed in the country's blue and yellow national colours. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The ministry of health in Hamas-run Gaza said four people were killed and six others wounded in Israeli attacks on Sunday after the first phase of a fragile truce in the territory drew to a close.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Since this morning, four dead and six wounded" have been brought to "hospitals in the Gaza Strip following Israeli attacks in various parts of the territory", the ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said that it struck suspects planting an "explosive device" in northern Gaza as the first phase of a fragile ceasefire with Hamas ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross called on Israel and Hamas to maintain their ceasefire in Gaza to prevent the conflict-weary region from sinking back into despair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire agreement has saved countless lives and offered a beacon of hope amid unimaginable suffering. Any unravelling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair," it said in a statement, adding the truce was "essential."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement came as Israel said it was suspending the entry of supplies into Gaza and as deadly attacks were reported in the territory after Israel and Hamas hit an impasse of how to proceed further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty urged on Sunday the "full implementation" of the Gaza ceasefire deal, calling on the European Union to pressure Israel to enforce it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no alternative to the faithful and full implementation by all parties of what was signed last January," Abdelatty said at a press conference in Cairo, urging the EU to exert "maximum pressure on the parties, especially the Israeli party, regarding commitment to the ceasefire agreement". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, hospitalised for more than two weeks with double pneumonia, on Sunday thanked believers around the world for their "support" and "affection" as he missed delivering a third straight Angelus prayer in person.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff, who has been treated at the Gemelli hospital in Rome since February 14, missed the traditional weekly prayer, which instead was published in the form of a letter the Vatican released at noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank you for the prayers, which rise up to the Lord from the hearts of so many faithful from many parts of the world. I feel all your affection and closeness and, at this particular time, I feel as if I am 'carried' and supported by all God's people. Thank you all," wrote the Argentine pontiff.
  <br>
  <br>
  He concluded by calling for peace in addressing conflicts around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I pray above all for peace. From here, war appears even more absurd. Let us pray for tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan and Kivu," the pope wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Vatican, the pope spent "a calm night".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope is still resting," the Holy See said earlier in its latest health update on the head of the Catholic Church.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday evening, it had said the pope's condition was "stable", adding that he was still receiving oxygen, had no fever, had been eating, was alert and praying. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain and France will work with Ukraine on a plan to end the fighting with Russia, which will later be presented to the United States, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The United Kingdom, along with France and possibly one or two others, will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, and then we'll discuss that plan with the United States," Starmer told British media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer hosted Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders on Sunday for a summit on the conflict, which has taken on huge significance in the wake of the clash between the Ukrainian president and US counterpart Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said "nobody wants to see" the scenes of the two leaders' White House clash, and that "I am clear in my mind that he (Trump) does want a lasting peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister has presented himself as a bridge between the United States and Europe, and met with Trump in Washington on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to find a way that we can all work together. Because, in the end, we've had three years of bloody conflict. Now we need to get to that lasting peace," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a risk that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will come again if he's given the opportunity to do so..., which is why I've been so centrally focused on what a guarantee is. How do we defend the line if a line is agreed," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Where that physical line would be is "a subject for discussion", said Starmer. (AFP)

    Private US spaceship lands on Moon

<img alt="A US company successfully landed its spacecraft on the Moon on Sunday, marking only the second private mission to achieve the milestone. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793887_1_20250302174506.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Firefly Aerospace became the second US company to land on the moon on Sunday with its debut Blue Ghost lander, kicking off a two-week research mission as one of a handful of private firms to reach the frontlines of a global moon race.
 <br>
  <br>
  The size of a compact car, the four-legged Blue Ghost carried 10 scientific payloads as it touched down near an ancient volcanic vent on Mare Crisium, a large basin in the northeast corner of the moon's Earth-facing side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flight controllers at Firefly's Austin, Texas headquarters watched as Blue Ghost descended toward the moon's surface at a gentle two miles per hour, confirming on a live stream that the spacecraft had entered lunar gravity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're on the moon," declared Will Coogan, Blue Ghost Chief Engineer at Firefly Aerospace, from mission control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefly became the second private firm to score a soft moon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Houston-based Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lander made a lopsided soft touchdown last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five nations have made successful soft landings in the past - the then-Soviet Union, the US, China, India and, last year, Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every single thing was clockwork, even when we landed, and then after, we saw everything was stable and upright," Firefly CEO Jason Kim said on stage at a company watch event in Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the audience were hundreds of Firefly employees, space industry officials and senior Nasa leaders, including the agency's acting administrator Janet Petro.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moonshot by Firefly, an upstart primarily building rockets, is one of three lunar missions actively in progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's ispace launched its second lander on the same rocket as Firefly's in January, before Intuitive Machines embarked on its second lunar mission on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two navigation cameras onboard Blue Ghost were used to spot hazards on the lunar surface during its final descent, helping the spacecraft steer toward an ideal landing spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impact sensors on the craft's four carbon-composite legs triggered Blue Ghost's engine to shutdown upon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two solar panels on the side and one of the top will power the lander and its research instruments for a 14-day mission on the moon, before the frigid lunar night brings temperatures as low as minus minus 173 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  Backed by Nasa and its flagship Artemis moon programme, private companies are playing an outsized role in the modern moon race with the hopes of stimulating a lunar market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are building landers to put US astronauts on the moon as soon as 2027 for the first time since 1972. (Reuters)

    Israel suspends entry of supplies into Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Sunday slammed Israel's suspension of supplies and aid entering Gaza, describing it as a "war crime" and a violation of the ceasefire agreement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's "decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the (ceasefire) agreement", the group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced earlier on Sunday that it was suspending the entry of supplies into Gaza, and threatened "consequences" for Hamas if it did not accept a proposal for a temporary extension of the truce in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided that, from this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be suspended," his office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel will not accept a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas persists with its refusal, there will be other consequences."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance, expired on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas was to release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout and a lasting ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said earlier on Sunday that it supported a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, or April 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the proposal came from the Trump administration's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 American singer Angie Stone, who was nominated for three Grammy Awards, died at 63 early on Saturday, a representative confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deborah R. Champagne, Stone's representative who last spoke with her shortly after 9 pm ET, said Stone died in a car accident in Montgomery, Alabama, following a performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guy Todd Williams, better known as Rahiem from the Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, which was the first rap group inducted into the Rock Hall, said nine other passengers were in a van with Stone during the accident. He said she was the only fatality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stone, a native of South Carolina, was a member of female hip-hop trio The Sequence. The group's most popular song, Funk You Up, peaked at 15 on Billboard's Hot Soul Singles. Rolling Stone described it as the first rap hit performed by women.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group was signed to the now defunct Sugar Hill Records, a label under of Warner Music Group, which also represented Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, among other artists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stone released her debut solo album, Black Diamond, in 1999. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America the following year. Her highest charting album -"The Art of Love & War" released in 2007- peaked at 11 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside of music, she acted in several films with her debut being "The Hot Chick" alongside Rob Schneider and Rachel McAdams. Stone also starred in "The Fighting Temptations" with Beyonce and Cuba Gooding Jr. (Reuters)

    Zelensky gets warm welcome in UK after Trump clash

<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday gave Volodymyr Zelensky a warm welcome in London, a day after the Ukrainian leader's clash with US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  And ahead of Sunday's summit in London to discuss how to support Ukraine as it battles Russia's forces, Starmer reiterated his support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In partnership with our allies, we must intensify our preparations for the European element of security guarantees alongside continued discussions with the United States," he said in a statement issued late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security, and secure our collective future," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours earlier, Ukraine and the UK unveiled a £2.26 billion (US$2.84 billion) loan agreement to support Ukraine's defence capabilities, to be paid back with the profits of immobilised sovereign Russian assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The funds will be directed toward weapons production in Ukraine," Zelensky said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is true justice -- the one who started the war must be the one to pay."
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters cheered as Zelensky's convoy swept into Downing Street, where he was embraced by Starmer and posed for photographs before heading inside the British leader's home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You're very, very welcome here in Downing Street," Starmer told Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom, for such big support from the very beginning of this war," Zelensky responded.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is due to meet King Charles III on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders met behind closed doors for around 75 minutes, and embraced again as Starmer escorted Zelensky to his car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier Saturday Zelensky had stressed that Trump's support was still "crucial" for Ukraine despite their row the previous day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash was a further shock to Kyiv's European allies, still adjusting to Washington's new stance on the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday as cameras in the Oval Office rolled, Trump berated Zelensky for not being "ready" for peace with Russia, triggering alarm across Europe. (AFP)

 Cars more than 15 years old will soon be barred from refuelling in New Delhi, the city's government said on Saturday, as part of measures to reduce the Indian capital's hazardous pollution levels.
 <br>
  <br>
  New Delhi is regularly ranked as one of the most polluted cities in the world and is blanketed in acrid smog each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pollution is primarily blamed on agricultural burning by nearby farmers to clear their fields for ploughing, as well as factories and traffic fumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds worsen the situation by trapping deadly pollutants each winter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diesel and petrol cars older than 10 and 15 years, respectively, are not allowed to ply on Delhi roads, but many have been found flouting the rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi's environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa told reporters on Saturday that the decision to stop fuel for the old cars was made at a "marathon meeting" on air pollution to "find out the diseases and its remedies."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have decided to stop giving fuel to vehicles more than 15 years old after March 31, 2025," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said "gadgets" would be installed at petrol pumps to identify such vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sirsa said other decisions taken include turning barren land into "new forests" and getting university students involved in planting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government would make it mandatory for high rises, hotels and Delhi airport to install anti-smog guns and gadgets to control pollution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public health crisis has grown steadily worse over the years, and weeks-long school closures across the capital, aimed at shielding vulnerable children from the harmful air, are now an annual occurrence.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the peak of the smog, levels of PM2.5 pollutants – dangerous cancer-causing microparticles small enough to enter the bloodstream through the lungs – surged to more than 60 times the World Health Organisation's recommended daily maximum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Piecemeal government initiatives, such as partial restrictions on fossil fuel-powered transport and water trucks spraying mist to clear particulate matter from the air, have failed to make a noticeable impact. (AFP)

    Hamas says 'no progress' on second phase of ceasefire

<div class="itemFullText">
 The latest round of talks on the second phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has made no progress so far, and it was unclear whether the talks would resume on Saturday, a senior Hamas official said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the ceasefire, which paused 15 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phase one expires on Saturday, but under the terms of the deal, fighting is not to resume while negotiations are underway on the second phase, which could end the war in Gaza and see the remaining living hostages returned home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials from Israel, Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been involved in negotiations on the second phase in Cairo, with the goal of bringing an end to the war with the return of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas did not attend the talks, but its position has been represented through Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said there had been “no progress” on finding a solution before Israeli negotiators returned home on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was unclear whether those mediators were going to return to Cairo to resume talks on Saturday as has been expected, and Naim said he had “no idea” when negotiations might start again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas started the war with its October 7 2023, attack that left 1,200 dead in Israel. Since then, Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say that more than half the dead have been women and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides agreed to the three-phase ceasefire deal in January, with the aim of bringing an end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Hamas said that it “reaffirms its full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details” and called on the international community to pressure Israel to “immediately proceed to the second phase without any delay or evasion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to phase two of the ceasefire, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that mediators in the talks were “also discussing ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the population and support stability in the region.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has rejected an Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire’s first phase by 42 days, saying it goes against the truce agreement, according to a member of the group who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli proposal calls for extending the ceasefire through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which started on Saturday, in return for an additional hostage exchange, the Hamas member said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN food agency, the World Food Programme, said in a post on social media on Saturday that it reached 1 million Palestinians across Gaza during the deal’s first phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pause in fighting helped “restoring distribution points, reopening bakeries, and expanding cash assistance,” the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The ceasefire must hold,” it said. “There can be no going back.” (AP)

    PKK declares ceasefire with Turkey after 40 years

<img alt="Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has described PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's appeal as an " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793814_1_20250301193855.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Outlawed Kurdish militants on Saturday declared a ceasefire with Turkey following a landmark call by jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan asking the group to disband.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the first reaction from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) after Ocalan this week called for the dissolution of the group and asked it to lay down arms after fighting the Turkish state for over four decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to pave the way for the implementation of leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society, we are declaring a ceasefire effective from today," the PKK executive committee said, referring to Ocalan and quoted by the pro-PKK ANF news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agree with the content of the call as it is, and we say that we will follow and implement it," the committee based in northern Iraq said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency since 1984 with the aim of carving out a homeland for Kurds, who account for around 20 percent of Turkey's 85 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Ocalan was jailed in 1999, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has cost more than 40,000 lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  After several meetings with Ocalan at his island prison, the pro-Kurdish DEM party on Thursday relayed his appeal for PKK to lay down its weapons and convene a congress to announce the organisation's dissolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK said on Saturday it was ready to convene a congress as Ocalan wanted, but "for this to happen, a suitable secure environment must be created" and Ocalan "must personally direct and lead it for the success of the congress."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group also said Ocalan's prison conditions must be eased, adding he "must be able to live and work in physical freedom and be able to establish unhindered relationships with anyone he wants, including his friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the last round of peace talks collapsed in 2015, no further contact was made until October, when a hardline nationalist ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered a surprise peace gesture if Ocalan rejected violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Erdogan backed the rapprochement, his government cranked up pressure on the opposition, arresting hundreds of politicians, activists and journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erdogan on Friday said Ocalan's appeal was a "historic opportunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Turkey would "keep a close watch" to make sure the talks to end the insurgency were "brought to a successful conclusion."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the pressure of terrorism and arms is eliminated, the space for politics in democracy will naturally expand," Erdogan promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iraq has welcomed Ocalan's call, saying it was "a positive and important step towards achieving stability in the region."
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK's presence in Iraq has been a recurrent source of tension between Baghdad and Ankara.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group holds positions in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, where Turkey also maintains military bases and often carries out ground and air operations against the Kurdish militants. (AFP)

    Pope spends 'peaceful night' after breathing crisis

 Pope Francis, hospitalised for two weeks with pneumonia in both lungs, spent a peaceful night after suffering a breathing crisis, the Vatican said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The pope spent a peaceful night and is resting," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff was put on a ventilator because of an "isolated" breathing crisis on Friday, the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His doctors said it would take the next 24 to 48 hours to see if this breathing trouble has worsened his condition or not, a Vatican source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff is "not out of danger" but was "in good spirits," the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis was hospitalised on February 14 with bronchitis, but his condition deteriorated into double pneumonia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical experts have warned that Francis's age and the chronic respiratory disease from which he suffers mean a sustained recovery will take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope, head of the world's nearly 1.4 billion Catholics, had part of one of his lungs removed as a young man and has suffered increasing health problems in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is prone to bronchitis and suffers from hip and knee pain, which has made him reliant on a wheelchair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nonetheless, Francis has continued to work from the special hospital suite on the Gemelli's 10th floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also has been doing breathing exercises in between resting and praying, according to the Vatican. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least four people died from their injuries in India after an avalanche hit a remote border area, officials said on Saturday, as rescuers deployed helicopters to search for the remaining five missing.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 55 workers were buried under snow and debris after the avalanche hit a construction camp on Friday near Mana village on the border with Tibet in the northern Himalayan state of Uttarakhand.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement issued on Saturday, the Indian army said 50 people were initially rescued, but among them, four succumbed to their injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, four injured persons have been confirmed as fatal casualty," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five workers were still missing, the army said, adding that six choppers had been deployed into rescue efforts as the "roads are blocked."
  <br>
  <br>
  Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the rescue teams were "continuously engaged in relief efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is fully committed to providing all possible assistance to those affected in this hour of crisis," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mana village, which shares a border with Tibet, was deserted after residents moved to lower altitudes to escape the extreme weather, The Indian Express newspaper reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avalanches and landslides are common in the upper reaches of the Himalayas, especially during the winter season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists have said climate change was making weather events more severe, while the increased pace of development in the fragile Himalayan regions has also heightened fears about the fallout from deforestation and construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, nearly 100 people died in Uttarakhand after a huge glacier chunk fell into a river, triggering flash floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devastating monsoon floods and landslides in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of development projects in the state. (AFP)

 Search teams in northern India on Saturday attempted to rescue 22 workers believed to be trapped after an avalanche hit a remote border area, officials and local media said.

<img alt="Gene Hackman was a two-time Academy Award winner and credited for intense performances inspired by his troubled upbringing. (AFP)" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793774_1_20250301120931.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hollywood legend Gene Hackman had likely been dead for over a week when he and his wife were found lifeless in their New Mexico home, the local sheriff said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities launched a probe into what they said were the "suspicious" deaths of Hackman, 95, and his classical pianist wife Betsy Arakawa, 63, as questions swirl over how the actor could have died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Santa Fe Sheriff Adan Mendoza told reporters that the partially mummified bodies had no external injuries but initial tests revealed "both individuals had tested negative for carbon monoxide."
  <br>
  <br>
  But, said Mendoza, tests had begun to narrow down a possible date of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An initial interrogation was conducted of Mr Hackman's pacemaker. This revealed that his last event was recorded on February 17, 2025," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that is a very good assumption, that was his last day of life."
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies of the Oscar-winning star of "The French Connection" and his wife were found on Wednesday, after emergency services were called to the scene when maintenance workers had been unable to access the sprawling property.
  <br>
  <br>
  First responders found the door unlocked and open, and pills scattered next to Arakawa's body, which was in the bathroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman's body was found in another room, fully clothed, with sunglasses next to his body, indicating a sudden fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A German Shepherd was found dead in the bathroom, and two other healthy dogs were at the house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mendoza said as they waited for the results of toxicology tests, which might shed some light on the tablets by Arakawa's body, investigators were now trying to piece together a timeline.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included looking through planners and cell phones and searching for any video that might give hints to the couple's movements over the last few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, he said, it was a complicated task, compounded by their low profile.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think everybody here understands that they were very private individuals and a very private family," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman, a two-time Academy Award winner, was credited for intense performances of everyman characters inspired by his troubled upbringing, notching up dozens of movie credits extending into his 70s. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan was battling its largest wildfire in more than three decades on Saturday, one of several blazes that have killed one person and forced the evacuation of more than a thousand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flames are estimated to have spread over about 1,200 hectares in the forest of Ofunato in the northern region of Iwate since fire broke out on Wednesday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still examining the size of the affected area, but it is the biggest since the 1992 wildfire in Kushiro, Hokkaido, an agency spokesman told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  That fire burned 1,030 hectares, the previous record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 1,700 firefighters were being mobilised from across the country, the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial footage from public broadcaster NHK showed white smoke billowing up and covering an entire mountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local police found the body of one person who had been burned on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 1,000 nearby residents have been evacuated and more than 80 buildings had been damaged as of Friday, according to the Ofunato municipality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the blaze remained unknown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other fires were also burning Saturday, one in Yamanashi and another elsewhere in Iwate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ofunato has seen only 2.5 millimetres of rainfall this month - on course to fall far below the previous record low for February of 4.4 millimetres in 1967.
  <br>
  <br>
  And last year was Japan's hottest since records began. (AFP)

    Microsoft to shut Skype in favour of Teams

<img alt='The president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms says the company "can deliver more innovation faster just by being focused on Teams." File Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793738_1_20250301070354.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Microsoft on Friday announced it was retiring Skype, the online voice and video call pioneer that the tech titan acquired in 2011.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Starting in May 2025, Skype will no longer be available," said a post from Skype support on X, directing users to sign into Microsoft's Teams platform for further use of its services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Skype was founded in 2003 by Scandinavians Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis in Estonia, revolutionizing internet communication by offering free voice calls between computers and affordable rates for calls to landlines and mobile phones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the years, and as internet speeds improved, Skype evolved to include video calls, instant messaging, file sharing, and group communication features.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 2005, Skype had already reached 50 million registered users, demonstrating its rapid global adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online auction site eBay acquired Skype in 2005 for approximately US$2.6 billion, but the expected synergies never panned out, and in 2009, eBay sold a majority stake to a group of investors, who then sold it to Microsoft.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, especially after the rise of the smartphone, Skype failed to hold onto its place against new rivals such as Meta-owned WhatsApp and Zoom, as well as Microsoft's own Teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've learned a lot from Skype... as we've evolved Teams over the last seven to eight years," Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms, told CNBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we felt like now is the time because we can be simpler for the market, for our customer base, and we can deliver more innovation faster just by being focused on Teams."
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft said that Skype group chats would remain intact in the transition to Teams and that during a 60-day window, messages on Microsoft and Teams will be interoperable so you can message contacts from Teams, and those messages will be delivered to friends still using Skype. (AFP)

    Trump berates Zelensky in shock Oval Office meeting

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump cut short a meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday and said the Ukrainian leader is "not ready" for peace with Russia in an extraordinary meltdown in the Oval Office that threw question marks over chances for a truce.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was meant to be making a full White House visit to sign a US-Ukrainian deal for joint exploitation of Ukraine's mineral resources, as part of a post-war recovery in a US-brokered peace deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, an ugly clash blew up almost immediately in the Oval Office where Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouted at Zelensky, accusing him of not being thankful for US help in the three-year war against Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump berated Zelensky, telling him to be more "thankful" and that without US assistance Ukraine would have been taken by Russia. "You're either going to make a deal or we're out," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky left in his motorcade shortly after, without holding a planned joint press conference. The resources deal was left unsigned, the White House said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took to his Truth Social platform to castigate Zelensky saying "he is not ready for Peace," Trump wrote. "He can come back when he is ready for Peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The dramatic public breakdown in the long-tense relationship between Zelensky and Trump came after their meeting - in front of a large group of journalists - had appeared to get off to a friendlier start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky had said, "I think President Trump is on our side."
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash left in doubt efforts led by Trump to cast himself as mediator in the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the shouting match erupted, Trump told Zelensky that a truce is "fairly close." The US leader also said that the proposed minerals deal would be "very fair."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Friday said Trump showed "restraint" by not hitting Ukrainian Zelensky during their shouting match in the White House. (AFP)

    Argentina agency blasted over disability scale

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina's state disability agency apologised on Thursday following a furore over the use of the terms "idiot", "imbecile" and "mentally retarded" to describe people with disabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The uproar was caused by a text published as part of libertarian President Javier Milei's clampdown on disability fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government, which is reviewing disability payments received by around a million Argentines, last month issued a decree setting out the parameters of mental and physical disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  An annex to the decree classified people with mental disabilities according to their IQ as follows: "0-30 (idiot)," "30-50 (imbecile)," "50-60 (severely mentally retarded," "60-70 (moderately mentally retarded)," and "70-90 (slightly mentally retarded)".
  <br>
  <br>
  Each category also included a description of which functions the person can perform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disability support groups and human rights groups protested the terminology and demanded that the National Disabilities Agency scrap the classification.
  <br>
  <br>
  The groups accused the agency of using "very violent terminology" which "reinforces stereotypes and historical discrimination".
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the agency admitted an "error" in using "obsolete terminology" and that it would modify the text to use universally accepted terms to describe levels of disability. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met at the White House on Thursday for their first in-person talks since the Republican leader upended US policy on Ukraine, the Middle East, and global trade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starmer is the second European leader to meet Trump this week after French President Emmanuel Macron came to the White House on Monday for a friendly encounter that nonetheless displayed stark differences about Russia's war with Ukraine and the US push for a quick ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British leader arrived at the White House on Thursday afternoon, where he was greeted by the president at the West Wing entrance ahead of meetings and a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the US could get a peace deal on Ukraine, Trump said that a peace deal needs to be struck soon between Ukraine and Russia or it may not happen "at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we've made a lot of progress and I think it's moving along pretty rapidly," Trump said. "It'll either be fairly soon or it won't be at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he trusted Russia's Vladimir Putin to stick to any Ukraine ceasefire, as Starmer tried to win security guarantees for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  He walked back a remark about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky being a dictator that alarmed European capitals, saying, "Did I say that?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters as he sat alongside Starmer in the Oval Office when asked about Putin, "I think he'll keep his word."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Britain can "take care of themselves, but if they need help, I'll always be with the British."
  <br>
  <br>
  The British premier told Trump at the White House that he wanted to "work with you to make sure that the peace deal is enduring" but that it was also a "deal that nobody breaches."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also expressed hope for a trade deal to be struck between both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to have a great trade agreement, one way or the other," Trump told reporters. "We're going to end up with a very good trade agreement for both countries, and we're working on that as we speak."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump will host Zelensky at the White House on Friday, where the two leaders are expected to sign a deal giving Washington access to Ukraine's rare minerals, which Trump has demanded as payback for US military aid. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would impose an added 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports while moving ahead with levies on Canada and Mexico next week, citing "unacceptable" fentanyl smuggling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump had announced – then halted – sweeping 25 percent levies on Canadian and Mexican imports this month over illegal immigration and deadly fentanyl, with Canadian energy to face a lower rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the month-long pause ends next Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following reporters' questions on whether he planned to proceed on the tariffs next week, Trump wrote on social media on Thursday that until the problem of fentanyl stops "or is seriously limited," proposed levies will happen as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will likewise be charged an additional 10 percent Tariff on that date," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not give further details on how the move interacts with an earlier levy he imposed on Chinese imports over Beijing's alleged role in the fentanyl supply chain, or how negotiations with China were proceeding.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has voiced firm opposition to the US decision to impose tariffs on Chinese imports under the pretext of fentanyl-related issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said it is one of the countries with the strictest drug control policies and the most rigorous enforcement in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump added on Truth Social that an April 2 date for so-called reciprocal tariffs "will remain in full force and effect." (AFP/Xinhua)

    US slashes foreign development aid by more than 90pc

<img alt="The Trump administration's review in part targeted multi-year foreign assistance contracts awarded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793539_1_20250227201224.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has slashed its multi-year aid contracts by 92 percent, as it sought around US$60 billion in savings in development and overseas humanitarian programmes, the State Department said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office, demanding a 90-day freeze on all US foreign aid to give his administration time to review overseas spending, with an eye to gutting programmes not aligned with his "America First" agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  A federal judge had given the Trump administration on Tuesday less than two days to unfreeze all aid after a previous court order issued nearly two weeks earlier went ignored.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Trump administration filed an emergency petition to the US Supreme Court, which issued an administrative stay late on Wednesday, pausing the lower court's order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the conclusion of a process led by USAID leadership, including tranches personally reviewed by Secretary (Marco) Rubio, nearly 5,800 awards with US$54 billion in value remaining were identified for elimination as part of the America First agenda – a 92 percent reduction," a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration's review in part targeted multi-year foreign assistance contracts awarded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), with the vast majority eliminated during its course.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also looked at more than 9,100 grants involving foreign assistance, valued at more than US$15.9 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the review, 4,100 grants worth almost US$4.4 billion were targeted to be eliminated, a 28 percent reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These commonsense eliminations will allow the bureaus, along with their contracting and grants officers, to focus on remaining programmes, find additional efficiencies and tailor subsequent programmes more closely to the Administration's America First priorities," the State Department statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID distributes US humanitarian aid around the world, with health and emergency programmes in around 120 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Programmes that were not cut included food assistance, life-saving medical treatments for diseases like HIV and malaria, and support for countries including Haiti, Cuba, Venezuela and Lebanon, among others, the State Department spokesperson said. (AFP)

 The European Union on Thursday pushed back against allegations by US President Donald Trump that the 27-nation bloc was out to get the United States, and warned that it would fight any wholesale tariff of 25 percent on all EU products.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pushback came after Trump told reporters at his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday that “the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That’s the purpose of it, and they’ve done a good job of it,” adding that it would stop immediately under his presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, went on a counter-offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The EU wasn’t formed to screw anyone," Tusk said in an X post. "Quite the opposite. It was formed to maintain peace, to build respect among our nations, to create free and fair trade, and to strengthen our transatlantic friendship. As simple as that.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also threatened to introduce tariffs on EU imports, saying his administration will soon announce a 25 percent "reciprocal" tariff on goods from its longtime trade partner, including cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said on Thursday that the EU would "do the same" if the US follows through with the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear that if the Americans maintain the tariff hikes, as President Trump announced, the EU will do the same," Lombard told AFP on the sidelines of the G20 finance ministers meeting in Cape Town.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if it is not in the general interest, we too must protect our interests and the interests of the countries of the union.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy’s business lobby said late on Wednesday that Trump’s tariff threat would undermine EU's companies, and its workforce and require a strong response from the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The threat is not only of an impact on trade dynamics. The truth is far more dramatic... What is coming from the American leadership is an attack on European companies and jobs," Confindustria president Emanuele Orsini said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Trump's trade policies aimed to "de-industrialise" the European continent and urged Brussels to consider "extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a dark hour," Orsini said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry Minister Adolfo Urso, a member of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party, took a more conciliatory tone, saying a trade war had to be avoided and urging unity among the Western allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta said this month that a full implementation of the tariffs, plus retaliatory measures, would cut EU growth by half a percentage point, with Germany and Italy hardest hit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tit-for-tat dispute further deepened the trans-Atlantic rift that was already widened by Trump's warnings that Washington would drop security guarantees for its European allies. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman, his wife and their dog were found dead in their New Mexico home on Wednesday, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foul play was not suspected, but authorities did not release circumstances of their deaths and said an investigation was ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Santa Fe County Sheriff’s deputies found Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and a dog dead when they preformed a welfare check at the home around 1.45pm, spokesperson Denise Avila said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman, 95, was a five-time Oscar nominee who starred in dozens of films and one of the industry’s most respected and honoured performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  His two Oscar wins, for “The French Connection” and “Unforgiven,” were spaced out 21 years apart.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of his death comes just four days before this year’s Academy Awards ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple’s home is in a gated community just outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico’s capital city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman moved in the 1980s to the area, where he was often seen around town and served as a board member of the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in the 1990s, according to the local paper, The New Mexican.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman played a variety of roles, appearing in action movies, thrillers and even had a comedic part in “Young Frankenstein.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Aside from appearances at awards shows, he was rarely seen in the Hollywood social circuit and retired in his mid-70s. (AP)

<img alt="Actress Michelle Trachtenberg, who starred in the 90s show 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', was found dead in her New York apartment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Michelle Trachtenberg, a former child star who appeared in the 1996 “Harriet the Spy” hit movie and went on to co-star in two buzzy millennial-era TV shows — “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Gossip Girl” — has died. She was 39.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police responded to a 911 call shortly after 8am at a 51-storey luxury apartment tower in Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood where officers found Trachtenberg "unconscious and unresponsive,” according to an NYPD statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paramedics pronounced her dead at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  No foul play was suspected and the New York Medical Examiner is investigating the cause of death, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The family requests privacy for their loss," Trachtenberg's representative, Gary Mantoosh, said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trachtenberg was eight when she began playing Nona Mecklenberg on Nickelodeon’s “The Adventures of Pete & Pete” from 1994 to 1996 and then starred in the title role in the film adaptations of “Harriet the Spy” and “Inspector Gadget,” opposite Matthew Broderick.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Michelle comes off as genuine because she really is a genuine kid. Everyone can identify with her,” said Debby Beece, president of Nickelodeon Movies in 1996.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2000 Trachtenberg joined the cast of “Buffy,” playing Dawn Summers, the younger sister of the title character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar between 2000 and 2003. (AP)

<img alt="US President Donald Trump hosts his first cabinet meeting with Elon Musk in attendance. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793415_1_20250227075523.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the European Union was born to "screw" the United States, laying bare his hostility to the longtime US partner as he detailed new tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's month back in the White House has been marked by soaring friction between Washington and its European allies, with the United States abruptly shifting gears on support for Ukraine and Germany's likely next leader urging Europe to seek take greater control of its own defense.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Look, let's be honest, the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States," Trump told reporters as he gathered his cabinet for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it. But now I'm president," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission shot back that the European Union is "the world's largest free market" and has been "a boon for the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt, writing on X, said Trump had a "seriously distorted view of history" as the EU was "actually set up to prevent war on the European continent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said at his cabinet meeting that the European Union has "really taken advantage of us."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States had a trade deficit to the 27-nation bloc of US$235.6 billion last year, according to official US figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if he had made a decision on tariff levels for the European Union, Trump added: "We'll be announcing it very soon and it'll be 25 percent, generally speaking."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that cars would be among the products to be hit, grim news for Germany whose export-driven economy has been in a slump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission warned it would respond "firmly and immediately" to new tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, while speaking to reporters during the meeting, Trump said he has a "very good" relationship with President Xi Jinping.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have a great relationship with President Xi. We want them to come in and invest. I see so many things saying that we don't want China in this country. That's not right. We want them to invest in the United States," said Trump. (Agencies)

<img alt="Palestinians sit next to a fire among the rubble of destroyed buildings, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, at Jabalia refugee camp, northern Gaza. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793405_1_20250227053207.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's official social media accounts posted an apparently AI-generated video depicting war-ravaged Gaza rebuilt into a seaside resort, replete with a towering golden statue of himself.
 <br>
  <br>
  The video, which racked up more than 29 million views on Instagram and was shared thousands of times on Trump's Truth Social network by Wednesday afternoon, prompted some commenters to question whether the president's accounts had been hacked.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-second clip remained on Trump's accounts without denial or retraction hours after the initial posting on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  The video "Gaza 2025 What's Next?" opens with people on a rubble-strewn street emerging from a tunnel onto a beach with palm trees and yachts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has floated the idea of a US takeover of Gaza under which its Palestinian population would be relocated, a proposal met with global condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later appeared to soften his plan, saying he was only recommending the idea, and conceding that the leaders of Jordan and Egypt, the proposed destinations for relocated Gazans, had rejected any effort to move Palestinians against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the social media clip, the soundtrack includes lyrics such as "Donald's coming to set you free, bringing the light for all to see", and "Feast and dance, the deal is done, Trump Gaza number one".
  <br>
  <br>
  Seemingly AI-generated renditions of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sip cocktails in swimsuits by a pool, while other shots show what appears to be Elon Musk dancing under a shower of cash on the beach.
  <br>
  <br>
  A larger-than-life golden statue of Trump is also featured.
  <br>
  <br>
  One scene closely resembles an AI-generated image of Trump and Netanyahu drinking cocktails that began circulating in early February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senir Hamas official Bassem Naim said in reaction to the video: "Unfortunately, President Trump is once again proposing ideas and solutions that do not take into account the cultures and interests of the indigenous population."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Gaza, people who watched the video were in disbelief.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This video of Trump is full of fallacies and shows a lack of cultural awareness... Gaza won't become a tourist spot like Italy or Spain," said Nasser Abu Hadaid, a 60-year-old resident of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas will hand over the bodies of four Israeli hostages on Thursday in what it said would be an exchange for more than 600 Palestinian prisoners, capping the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States said talks were on track for a second phase of the ceasefire deal that has largely held but whose complexity and long-drawn-out implementation have highlighted its fragility.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel on Wednesday, thousands of mourners gathered for the funeral of Shiri Bibas and her sons, who had died in captivity in Gaza and had become symbols of the country's hostage ordeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire has largely halted the Israel-Hamas war sparked by the October 7, 2023 attack, and has seen 25 hostages released alive so far in exchange for hundreds of prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas and other resistance factions will hand over four bodies of Israeli captives," said a Hamas official, adding that in return, Israel would free 625 Palestinian prisoners in an exchange beginning on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has reached an agreement with mediators for the return of the bodies of four Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington, US President Donald Trump's top envoy on the Middle East said Israeli representatives were en route to talks on the next phase of the ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're making a lot of progress. Israel is sending a team right now as we speak," Steve Witkoff told an event for the American Jewish Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's either going to be in Doha or in Cairo, where negotiations will begin again with the Egyptians and the Qataris," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This first phase is supposed to end on Saturday, but negotiations for the next stage – which were due to begin in early February – have not yet started.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has said it is ready to release all the remaining hostages "in one go" during the second phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, the group accused Israel of endangering the Gaza truce by delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said it had concerns over how the hostages have been freed, with Netanyahu describing the handovers as "humiliating ceremonies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has yet to comment on whether it will release the Palestinian prisoners on Thursday. (AFP)

    Power mostly restored after blackout hits Chile

<img alt="A drone shot shows a general view of Concepcion, during a major power outage that affected vast swathes of Chile. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793291_1_20250226151351.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chilean authorities said they had restored power to most homes on Wednesday, hours after a massive, rare blackout caused transport chaos in the capital and forced the president to declare a state of emergency and curfew across much of the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chile's worst blackout in well over a decade struck on Tuesday afternoon, leaving millions without power.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Gabriel Boric blamed private companies that manage the grid for the system's failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is outrageous! The daily life of millions of Chileans can't be impacted like this by companies that don't do their job," Boric said in a statement issued by his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early Wednesday, "90 percent of (electricity) consumption was restored" to homes, the power system's operator said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Senapred disaster response agency, the outage affected an area stretching all the way from Arica in the long, narrow South American country's north to Los Lagos in the south -- an area home to over 90 percent of Chile's 20 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blackout disrupted transport in the capital Santiago, where thousands were evacuated from the metro and people jostled to board overflowing buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Boric had activated "a state of emergency due to a catastrophe" and announced a curfew until 6am Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Carolina Toha ruled out sabotage as the reason for the power loss, which began at 3.16pm in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no reason to assume that this is an attack," she said on Tuesday, telling reporters it was more likely "a failure in the system's operation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The metro company, which transports 2.3 million passengers every day, said workers were deployed to all stations "to support safe evacuations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Out-of-service traffic lights caused major gridlock, with some people having to walk for hours under a hot sun to reach their homes. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of births in South Korea rose last year for the first time in roughly a decade on the back of a rise in marriages, officials said on Wednesday, bucking a trend for a country battling a demographic crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has one of the world's longest life expectancies and lowest birth rates -- a combination that presents a looming demographic challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul has poured billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crude birth rate -- the number of babies born per 1,000 people -- was 4.7, interrupting a continuous downward trend since 2014, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the fertility rate, or the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime, was 0.75, "up 0.03 from 0.72 in 2023", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of births in 2024 was 238,300, an increase of 8,300 (3.6 percent) from the previous year," the report added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Park Hyun-jeong, an official from Statistics Korea, attributed the rise to an increase in marriages as well as shifting demographics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The population has seen a significant increase in the number of people in their early 30s," she told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has had a major impact," Park explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additionally, many marriages that were delayed due to Covid-19 have now taken place, and this upward trend continues."
  <br>
  <br>
  Park said the number of marriages last year had been the most since 1996 -- "the highest on record".
  <br>
  <br>
  The average maternal age at childbirth in 2024 was 33.7 years, Seoul said, one of the highest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the fertility rate remains far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain South Korea's population of 51 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  At current rates, the population will nearly halve to 26.8 million by 2100, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle. (AFP)

    'Doctor of the poor' becomes Venezuela's first saint

<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuela will soon have its first saint, after ailing Pope Francis on Tuesday canonised a physician who died more than 100 years ago, revered for his selfless service during a previous pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jose Gregorio Hernandez was born in 1864, studied in Paris, Berlin, Madrid and New York, and died in Caracas in 1919 after being struck by a car.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was beatified – an earlier step towards sainthood – in 2021 amid a surge of coronavirus cases in Venezuela, a century after Hernandez became known as the "doctor of the poor" caring for patients during another major global pandemic, the Spanish flu.
  <br>
  <br>
  His beatification was made possible after a "miracle" attributed to him was recognised by the Church – the recovery of a 10-year-old girl who had been shot in the head in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doctors had said she would be permanently brain damaged if she survived, but the girl recovered after her mother prayed to Hernandez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis approved the canonisation of Hernandez and another new saint from his hospital bed in Rome, where he is being treated for double pneumonia, the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the pontiff's approval, canonisation is usually formalised at a special mass in honour of the new saint. (AFP)

    A third of Musk's Doge staff resign in protest

<img alt="Elon Musk's downsizing has led to the layoff of more than 20,000 workers. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793173_1_20250226062227.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 20 civil service employees resigned on Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services”.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honour those commitments.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The employees also said many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists, designers and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president's tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was dismissive of the mass resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years," Leavitt said. "President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk posted on his social media site X that the story was “fake news” and suggested that the staffers were “Dem political holdovers" who “would have been fired had they not resigned.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The staffers who resigned had worked for the United States Digital Service, but said their duties were being integrated into Doge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their former office, the USDS, was established under President Obama after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law.
  <br>
  <br>
  All previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. (AP)

    Macron to brief EU leaders on Trump Ukraine talks

<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron will brief fellow EU leaders on Wednesday on his talks with US President Donald Trump, ahead of an emergency summit on European support for Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Antonio Costa, who heads the European Council representing the bloc's 27 member states, announced on X he had convened a videoconference with Macron to prepare for the March 6 leaders' talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe has scrambled for a unified response since Trump two weeks ago declared his readiness to negotiate with Russia – and without European involvement – on ending the three-year-old Ukraine war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite a veneer of cordiality, the transatlantic rift over Ukraine was on display during Macron's talks with Trump on Monday – the third anniversary of the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French leader warned at the White House afterwards that peace cannot mean the "surrender" of Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want a quick deal but not a fragile one," said Macron, who insisted any settlement must include US security guarantees for Kyiv – to prevent any future Russian assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  In parallel, the United States sided with Russia in two votes at the United Nations on Monday to avoid condemning Moscow's campaign against Ukraine – a seismic shift from the stance of the previous US administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's embrace of Russia has sparked fears that it could herald the end of US support for Kyiv and a major change in attitude toward the rest of Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next week's talks in Brussels will focus on supporting Kyiv and bolstering Europe's defences after Trump's opening to Moscow – at what Costa called "a defining moment for Ukraine and European security." (AFP)

    UK PM pledges to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2027

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Tuesday pledged to boost defence spending to 2.5 percent of the economy by 2027 with the aim of hiking it to 3 percent in the next parliament.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of key talks on Ukraine with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday, Starmer told parliament the increase would be funded by cutting overseas development aid from 0.5 percent to 0.3 percent of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has demanded that Nato allies more than double their defence spending targets to five percent of economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK spent 2.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence in 2023/24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer's Labour government had previously committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent, but had not set a timeline.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told lawmakers there would be some "hard choices" but it would be the "biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government would also "set a clear ambition for defence spending to rise to 3 percent of GDP in the next parliament," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has repeatedly called on European nations to boost their defence spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The nature of warfare has changed significantly. That is clear from the battlefield in Ukraine, and so we must modernise and reform our capabilities as we invest," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This investment means that the UK will strengthen its position as a leader in Nato and in the collective defence of our continent, and we should welcome that role." (AFP)

    Search for MH370 resumes 11 years after disappearance

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fresh search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been launched more than a decade after the plane went missing in one of aviation's greatest enduring mysteries.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity has resumed the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke told reporters contract details between Malaysia and the firm were still being finalised but welcomed "the proactiveness of Ocean Infinity to deploy their ships" to begin the search for the plane, which went missing in March 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said details about how long the search would last had not been negotiated yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also did not provide details about when exactly the British firm restarted its hunt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Malaysian government said in December it had agreed to launch a new search for MH370.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of the passengers were Chinese, while the others included Malaysians, Indonesians and Australians, as well as Indian, American, Dutch and French nationals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane has never been found despite the largest search in aviation history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're very relieved and pleased that the search is resuming once again after such a long hiatus," said Malaysian Grace Nathan, 36, who lost her mother on the doomed jet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaquita Gonzales, 62, wife of MH370 flight supervisor Patrick Gomes, said she hoped the resumption of the search would bring her family much-needed closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just want to know where it is and what happened," she said. "Memories come back like yesterday, it's fresh in our heads."
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said in December the new search would be on the same "no find, no fee" principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if the firm finds the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The contract was for 18 months and Malaysia would pay US$70 million to the company if the plane was found, Loke had previously said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, carried out an unsuccessful hunt in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's first efforts followed a massive Australia-led search for the aircraft that lasted three years before it was suspended in January 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometres (46,300 square miles) in the Indian Ocean but found hardly any trace of the plane other than a few pieces of debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said in December a new 15,000 square kilometre (5,800 square mile) area of the southern Indian Ocean would be scoured by Ocean Infinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They combined all the data and they felt confident that the current search area is more credible," Loke said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have convinced us that they are ready."
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane's disappearance has long been the subject of theories, ranging from the credible to the outlandish, including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue.
  <br>
  <br>
  A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the plane's course was changed manually. (AFP)

 Four people, including two Chinese nationals, were killed and six injured after a bridge collapsed at an expressway construction site in South Korea on Tuesday, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Local media aired dramatic footage of what appeared to be a section of the bridge collapsing, sending a massive cloud of smoke into the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four people were killed, five were seriously injured and one suffered a minor injury, a statement from the National Fire Agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of those killed, two were Chinese nationals and two were South Koreans, an interior ministry official told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident occurred at around 9.50am in Anseong, around 65 kilometres south of the South Korean capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All individuals who suffered injuries are currently being treated at hospitals," the National Fire Agency's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Fire Agency initially said it took place in the nearby city of Cheonan but later corrected that claim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai Engineering, the main contractor of the construction site, apologised and said it was assisting authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We sincerely bow our heads in apology to those who lost their precious lives and were injured in the accident at our construction site," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are actively cooperating with the relevant authorities to ensure a prompt resolution on-site" and to identify the cause of the accident, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting President Choi Sang-mok issued urgent directives to mobilise all available resources and personnel for the rescue operation. (AFP)

  Yoon's short-lived suspension of civilian rule plunged democratic South Korea into political turmoil, and he was removed from office by parliament in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 64-year-old has been behind bars since he was arrested last month on charges of insurrection, for which he could be sentenced to life in prison or even face the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  His trial began last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  After weeks of fraught impeachment hearings at the Constitutional Court in Seoul, Tuesday's court session was his last before the eight judges go behind closed doors to decide his fate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Proceedings began at 2pm but Yoon was not present, reporters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of lawmakers from his ruling People Power Party were in attendance, however.
  <br>
  <br>
  In opening remarks, Yoon's defence team cited a 2024 US Supreme Court ruling, Donald Trump v. the United States, arguing the ousted president cannot be punished for "exercising his core constitutional powers".
  <br>
  <br>
  That ruling "should be considered in the context of impeachment proceedings", Yoon's lawyer Lee Dong-chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is expected to deliver a closing argument in his defence, with representatives of parliament given time to present the case for his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the court, pro-Yoon protesters chanted "Drop impeachment!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Others held signs saying "Stop the Steal", echoing US President Trump's false claims of voter fraud when he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  A verdict is widely expected in mid-March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously impeached presidents Park Geun-hye and Roh Moo-hyun had to wait 11 and 14 days, respectively, to learn their fates.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon is removed from office, the country must hold a fresh presidential election within 60 days. (AFP)

    Roberta Flack of 'Killing Me Softly' fame dies aged 88

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer behind the classic "Killing Me Softly With His Song" and one of the most recognisable voices of the 1970s, died on Monday at age 88.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flack's publicist announced her death without citing a cause.
  <br>
  <br>
  The influential pop and R&B star in recent years had lost her ability to sing because of ALS, known as Lou Gehrig's disease, which she was diagnosed with in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She died peacefully surrounded by her family," the statement from the publicist said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The classically trained musician with a tender but confident voice produced a number of early classics of rhythm and blues that she frequently described as "scientific soul," timeless works that blended meticulous practice with impeccable taste.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her exceptional talent was key to the "quiet storm" radio form of smooth, sensuous slow jams that popularised R&B and influenced its later aesthetics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been told I sound like Nina Simone, Nancy Wilson, Odetta, Barbra Streisand, Dionne Warwick, even Mahalia Jackson," Flack said in 1970 in The New York Times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If everybody said I sounded like one person, I'd worry. But when they say I sound like them all, I know I've got my own style."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jennifer Hudson hailed Flack as "one of the great soul singers of all time," and Roots drummer Questlove wrote "Thank You Robert Flack. Rest in Melody." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday called for "real, lasting peace" this year as European leaders gathered for a summit in Kyiv on the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We have to win peace through strength and wisdom and unity," Zelensky told Ukraine's backers in Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  He vowed at a press conference later that Russia "will not win".
  <br>
  <br>
  EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also warned that despite opening talks with the United States on how to end the conflict, Vladimir Putin was not about to back down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Putin is trying harder than ever to win this war on the ground. His goal remains Ukraine's capitulation," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia said it would halt the attack only if a deal could be reached that "suits" its interests, and accused Europe of wanting to prolong the fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Monday, President Xi Jinping held a phone conversation with Putin and said China is happy to see efforts by Moscow and others to defuse the crisis in Ukraine, adding that China and Russia will support each other and achieve common development. (AFP)

    Canada, Mexico tariffs are going forward: Trump

<img alt="US President Donald Trump wants to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as March 4. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793020_1_20250225073658.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his tariffs on Canada and Mexico are starting next month, ending a month-long suspension on the planned import taxes that could potentially hurt economic growth and worsen inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We’re on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that’s moving along very rapidly,” he said at a White House news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump was answering a specific question about the taxes to be charged on America's two largest trading partners, the US president also stressed more broadly that his intended “reciprocal” tariffs were on schedule to begin as soon as April.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has claimed that other countries charge unfair import taxes that have come at the expense of domestic manufacturing and jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  His near constant threats of tariffs have already raised concerns among businesses and consumers about an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump claims that the import taxes would ultimately generate revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit and new jobs for workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum appeared confident on Monday that her administration would reach agreements with the US government before the deadline set by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would need to be reaching important agreements this Friday,” Sheinbaum told reporters before Trump's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In high-level discussions between both governments, Mexico has insisted that the US also take a hard look at the drug distribution and consumption in its own country rather than pointing only at production in Mexico, Sheinbaum said. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three improvised explosive devices were thrown at the Russian consulate in the southern French port city of Marseille on Monday but no one was injured, a police source said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Only two of the devices detonated in the attack on the third anniversary of Russia's campaign in Ukraine, the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consulate was sealed off by police and AFP journalists heard a detonation caused by a bomb disposal robot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian foreign ministry denounced what it called a "terrorist attack".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The explosions on the territory of the Russian consulate general in Marseille have all the signs of a terrorist attack," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russian reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We demand that the host country undertake exhaustive and speedy investigative measures, as well as steps to strengthen the security of Russia's foreign missions," said Zakharova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris condemned the incident. "France condemns any infringement of the security of diplomatic compounds," a foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The inviolability, protection and integrity of diplomatic and consular compounds and their staff are fundamental principles in international law," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dozen leaders from Europe and Canada were in Ukraine's capital on Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s military campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were set to attend anniversary events and discuss supporting Kyiv with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday held a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine and said China is happy to see efforts by Moscow and others to defuse the crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua News Agency quoted the president as saying "China is happy to see Russia and relevant parties make positive efforts to defuse the Ukraine crisis".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said China and Russia are good neighbours and true friends supporting each other and achieving common development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said their relationship does not target any third party, nor would it be influenced by any third party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said in a statement that Xi expressed his support for dialogue between the US and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia last week and agreed to start work on restoring bilateral ties and preparing for Ukraine peace talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a dozen leaders from Europe and Canada were in Ukraine's capital on Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s military campaign.
  <br>

    Tens of thousands vow support for Lebanon's Hezbollah

<img alt="Masses of mourners attend the funeral of former Hezbollah leaders Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792878_1_20250224083246.jpg&q=1">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of black-clad mourners vowed support for Hezbollah at the Beirut funeral of slain leader Hassan Nasrallah on Sunday, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nasrallah shared the funeral with his cousin and successor, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb a few days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Saturday, roads into Beirut have been clogged with carloads of supporters travelling in from Hezbollah's other power centres in south and east Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I saw the coffin, reality dawned upon me," said Lara, 26, adding that she had a hard time coming to terms with his killing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pain is great... words cannot describe how I feel," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A founding member of Hezbollah in 1982, Nasrallah won renown around the Arab world in May 2000 when Israel ended its 22-year occupation of south Lebanon following relentless attacks by the group under his leadership.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the decades since, Lebanese have been divided over Hezbollah, with many criticising the group for initiating more recent hostilities with Israel in support of Palestinian militant group Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the funeral began, Israeli warplanes flew at a low altitude over Beirut in what Defence Minister Israel Katz said was a "clear message" to anyone who threatens Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You will specialise in funerals - and we in victories," Katz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address at the ceremony, Nasrallah's successor Naim Qassem said Hezbollah would keep following his "path", and rejected any control by the "tyrant America" over Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resistance is not over, the resistance is still present and ready" to face Israel, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has carried out multiple strikes in Lebanon since a November 27 ceasefire deal with Hezbollah ended more than a year of hostilities, including two months of all-out war. (Agencies)

    Zelensky says progress made on reaching deal with US

<img alt="Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, had earlier declined a US draft agreement on exploitation of his country's valuable minerals. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792870_1_20250224063736.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A contentious Trump administration proposal to give the United States US$500 billion worth of profits from Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for its wartime assistance to Kyiv has been taken off the table, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday, indicating a more equitable deal was in the works.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky had earlier declined a US draft agreement on exploitation of his country's valuable minerals such as lithium used in the aerospace, defence and nuclear industries because it did not contain security guarantees and came with the US$500 billion price tag.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The question of US$500 billion is no longer there,” Zelenskyy told a news conference at a forum of government officials in Kyiv marking the three-year anniversary of Russia’s attack on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian leader said considering aid as a debt to be repaid would be a “Pandora's box” that would set a precedent requiring Kyiv to reimburse all its backers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not recognise the debt," Zelensky said. "It will not be in the final format of the agreement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  No further details were given on the state of negotiations. Ukraine has insisted on security guarantees that it needs to deter any potential Russian aggression in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's engagement with Russian officials and his recent agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow have marked a dramatic about-face in US policy that has rattled leaders in Ukraine and across Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has expressed fear that Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in Ukraine losing territory. US officials have asserted the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine this week when he suggested Kyiv had started the war and Zelensky was acting as a “dictator” by not holding elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the state Tass news agency that Moscow and Washington would continue bilateral talks at the end of next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other top EU officials were headed to Kyiv on Monday for talks with Ukraine’s government.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were to both visit Washington this week as Europe attempts to persuade Trump not to abandon Ukraine in pursuit of a peace deal. (AP)

 Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners it had planned to free the day before until militant group Hamas met its conditions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel was waiting to deliver the 620 Palestinian prisoners and detainees "until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies."
  <br>
  <br>
  That was a reference to recent handovers by Hamas that UN officials have said went against international law because they were not respectful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has made hostages appear on stage in front of crowds and sometimes speak before they were handed over. Coffins with hostage remains have also been carried through crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas official Basem Naim, meanwhile, said on Sunday talks with Israel through mediators on further steps in a ceasefire agreement are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being released as agreed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Prisoner's Society, a local group that supports Palestinian prisoners, said Israel is practising "state-terrorism against the prisoners and their families".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ghasan Washahi, whose brother was set to be released on Saturday, said his family was disappointed with the delay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every time there was a list of prisoners set to be released, we would wait, hoping Islam's name would be among them, but it was never there," he said, referring to his brother.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My mother even started losing hope that he would be freed in the deal. And when his name finally appeared, Israel halted the deal." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's conservatives swept to victory in Sunday's elections, with their leader Friedrich Merz set to become the next chancellor, followed by the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in second place after record gains.
 <br>
  <br>
  Merz urged the speedy formation of a new coalition government, warning that as US President Donald Trump was driving rapid and disruptive changes, "the world isn't waiting for us".
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that – after Trump reached out to Russia and made comments fuelling doubts about the future strength of NATO – Europe must boost its defence capabilities and said that he has "no illusions at all about what is coming out of America".
  <br>
  <br>
  The AfD almost doubled its score to over 20 percent, boosted by fears over immigration and security after a spate of deadly attacks blamed on asylum seekers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz's CDU/CSU alliance won more than 28 percent, according to projections at 2000 GMT, crushing the Social Democrats (SPD) of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which were looking at a historic low of 16 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz – a long-time party rival of ex-chancellor Angela Merkel – has vowed a crackdown on irregular immigration. He hopes to win back votes from the AfD whose rise has stunned many in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, the AfD, basking in the vocal support of key Trump allies, is set to stay in opposition. All other parties have vowed to keep it out of power and behind a "firewall" of non-cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But its jubilant leader Alice Weidel hailed the "historic" result and again said her party was ready to govern with the CDU/CSU.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before Merz, 69, takes over, he will have to forge a new coalition government in Europe's top economy, an often drawn-out process he has vowed to complete by Easter. (AFP)

 European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she held talks with the British and French leaders this weekend and all had pledged "unflinching" support for Ukraine ahead of the third anniversary of its war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We discussed our unflinching support to Ukraine, financially and militarily," Von der Leyen said of her telephone discussions with France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU chief said in a post on the X platform she had "good exchanges" with two key European leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We shared updates on our contacts with US partners and discussed plans for the defence and security of our continent," she said amid growing US-Europe tensions on the Ukraine conflict and funding for Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron and Starmer are both due in Washington this week for talks with US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Downing Street, Starmer and von der Leyen agreed on the importance of offering guarantees for a just and durable peace in Ukraine when they spoke on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  European states are concerned that, in his desire to end the conflict, Trump will offer Moscow favourable conditions without providing Kyiv with security guarantees while keeping European powers away from negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mark the third anniversary of the war, Starmer said in an opinion piece for The Sun on Sunday newspaper that "it is in UK and US interests to stand by Ukraine with security guarantee." (AFP)
