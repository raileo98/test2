<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Fuji Media said on Monday its chairman and the head of its TV unit would step down immediately amidst a probe into alleged sexual misconduct by a celebrity TV host.
 <br>
  <br>
  The scandal, which has led to an exodus of advertisers and investor calls for a management shake-up, has also raised concerns about the exploitation of women in Japan's entertainment industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December, Japanese magazines accused Masahiro Nakai, a TV host and leader of the former boy band SMAP, of sexual misconduct. While Nakai has worked for many of Japan's TV networks, the dinner at which the incident occurred was reportedly arranged by one of the broadcaster's executives.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the magazines, Shukan Bunshun, has also reported the same executive had in a separate event gathered female TV personalities at a hotel to act as entertainment for Nakai and other celebrities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nakai, 52, has apologised for causing "trouble" and announced his retirement from show business. He acknowledged reaching a settlement with another party but has not addressed the allegations directly. Nakai did not respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fuji Media said Chairman Shuji Kanoh and the head of its TV unit Koichi Minato would step down effective Monday. Another TV executive, Kenji Shimizu, will lead the TV unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to tabloid magazines Josei Seven and Shukan Bunshun, a woman was invited to a dinner in June 2023 with a Fuji TV executive that Nakai also attended. But the executive backed out at the last minute leaving her alone with Nakai and there was a sexual act against her will, they reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First of all, as a person, I would like to offer my sincere apologies to the woman involved to whom we were unable to show adequate care and awareness of human rights," Kanoh told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Fuji Media spokesperson said the company became aware of the woman's complaint that June but did not widely investigate it or report it due to privacy concerns and settlement talks between the parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said on Monday that it had questioned an employee multiple times about the dinner and that the employee had denied knowing about or arranging the dinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outrage over the scandal grew after a January 17 news conference by Minato that was closed to most of the press with Minato answering few questions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of big-name firms including Toyota and cosmetics giant Kao have suspended advertising with Fuji and most of its ads are currently public service announcements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fuji Media has promised an independent investigation by a third-party committee. It will be made up of three lawyers and is scheduled to submit a report by the end of March. (Reuters)

    Low-cost Chinese AI startup shocks Wall Street

<img alt="The chatbot, developed in Hangzhou, reportedly matches the capacity of US AI pace-setters, sending shockwaves through US markets overnight.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since December 18 on Monday as a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model prompted a steep selloff in US chipmakers.
 <br>
  <br>
  AI leader Nvidia sank 17 percent, and about US$590 billion in stock market value, the deepest ever one-day loss for a company on Wall Street, according to LSEG data. It was more than double the previous one-day record loss, set by Nvidia last September.
  <br>
  <br>
  An index of semiconductor stocks dropped 9.2 percent in its biggest single-day percentage fall since March 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese startup DeepSeek has rolled out a free assistant that it says uses lower-cost chips and less data, raising questions about investor expectations that AI will drive demand along a supply chain from chipmakers to data centers.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek's AI Assistant by Monday had overtaken US rival ChatGPT in downloads from Apple's App Store.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, said there are still many questions about the DeepSeek model and its impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today is a drubbing for these (AI leader) stocks, but I don't necessarily think whatever's going to happen in the short while here - the next couple of days - is where they are ultimately valued," she said. Optimism over AI and gains in Nvidia and other big technology-related shares helped to drive the stock market's sharp gains in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 points, or 0.65 percent, to 44,713.58, the S&P 500 lost 88.96 points, or 1.46  percent, to 6,012.28 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 612.47 points, or 3.07 percent, to 19,341.83.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 registered its biggest one-day percentage fall since January 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other big tech-related companies, Microsoft shares fell 2.1 percent and Google-parent Alphabet dropped 4.2 percent, while AI server maker Dell Technologies declined 8.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data centre operators also tanked, including Digital Realty, which fell 8.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Power companies, which are expected to see higher demand from energy-intensive data centres needed to develop AI technology, also fell. Vistra dropped 28.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech stocks are likely to stay in focus this week, with some big technology names, including Microsoft, due to post-quarterly results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are keen to hear from the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to hold its lending rate steady in its first interest-rate decision of the year due on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers also were digesting news that the US and Colombia had pulled back from the brink of a trade war on Sunday after the White House said the South American nation had agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants. (Reuters)

    Congolese rebels say they've captured city of Goma

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rwanda-backed rebels claimed they captured eastern Congo’s largest city of Goma early on Monday, as the United Nations described a mass panic among its two million people and Congo’s government said the rebel advance was a “declaration of war."
 <br>
  <br>
  The M23 rebels announced the city's capture in a statement minutes before a 48-hour deadline expired that had been imposed by the group for the Congolese army to surrender their weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Monday morning, gunfire was heard throughout the city, according to two aid workers sheltering there who were not authorised to speak to the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the rebels urged residents of Goma to remain calm and for members of the Congolese military to assemble at the central stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The M23 rebels’ offensive in the heart of the mineral-rich region threatens to dramatically worsen one of Africa’s longest wars and further displace civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a United Nations report, over a third of the population of North Kivu province where Goma is located are currently displaced and the capture of Goma will likely exacerbate the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late Sunday night, UN peacekeepers began to process members of the military who had begun to surrender on the outskirts of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya made a statement in a video posted on X calling for the protection of civilians and saying the country is “in a war situation where the news is changing.”
  <br>
  <br>
  French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the Rwanda-backed offensive "must stop", expressing his country's solidarity with the Democratic Republic of Congo.
  <br>
  <br>
  With international pressure mounting for an end to the battle for Goma, Kenya announced on Sunday that Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame had agreed to attend a summit in the next two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  M23 fighters and 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan soldiers had been laying siege to Goma for several days, according to the United Nations and security sources. (Agencies)

    World marks 80 years since Auschwitz liberation

Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789329_1_20250127174138.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world marked 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on Monday, with some of the few remaining survivors attending ceremonies at the site of the Nazi death camp.
 <br>
  <br>
  Auschwitz was the largest of the extermination camps and has become a symbol of Nazi Germany's genocide of six million European Jews, one million of whom died at the site between 1940 and 1945, along with more than 100,000 non-Jews.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday morning, Polish President Andrzej Duda laid flowers at the site alongside survivors, some wearing scarves in the blue-and-white stripes of their death camp uniforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 50 survivors were expected at the main commemoration outside the gates of Auschwitz II-Birkenau alongside dozens of world leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we will focus on the survivors and their message," Auschwitz Museum spokesman Pawel Sawicki told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will not be any speeches by politicians."
  <br>
  <br>
  Survivors around the world spoke about the need to preserve the memory of what happened when there will no longer be living witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also warned about rising hatred and anti-Semitism around the world and spoke of their fears about history repeating itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said it could be the last major anniversary with such a large group of survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all know that in 10 years it will not be possible to have a large group for the 90th anniversary," Sawicki said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Auschwitz was created in 1940 using barracks in Oswiecim, southern Poland. Its name was Germanised into Auschwitz by the Nazis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first 728 Polish political prisoners arrived on June 14 of that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 17, 1945, as Soviet troops advanced, the SS forced 60,000 emaciated prisoners to walk west in what became known as the "Death March".
  <br>
  <br>
  From January 21-26, the Germans blew up the Birkenau gas chambers and crematoria and withdrew as Soviet troops approached.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 27, Soviet troops arrived, finding 7,000 survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day of its liberation has been designated by the United Nations as Holocaust Remembrance Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until the conflict with Ukraine in 2022, a Russian delegation had always attended the annual liberation ceremony but Moscow will be barred again this year. (AFP)

    Palestinians begin returning to northern Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Masses of displaced Palestinians began streaming towards the north of the war-battered Gaza Strip on Monday after Israel and Hamas said they had reached a deal for the release of another six hostages.
 <br>
  <br>
  The breakthrough preserves a fragile ceasefire and paves the way for more hostage-prisoner swaps under an agreement aimed at ending the more than 15-month conflict, which has devastated the Gaza Strip and displaced nearly all its residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel had been preventing Palestinians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza, accusing Hamas of violating the terms of the truce, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said late on Sunday they would be allowed to pass after the new deal was reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds began making their way north along a coastal road on foot Monday morning, carrying what belongings they could.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a great feeling when you go back home, back to your family, relatives and loved ones, and inspect your house -- if it is still a house," displaced Gazan Ibrahim Abu Hassera told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas called the return "a victory" for Palestinians that "signals the failure and defeat of the plans for occupation and displacement".
  <br>
  <br>
  Its ally Islamic Jihad, meanwhile, called it a "response to all those who dream of displacing our people".
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments came after US President Donald Trump floated an idea to "clean out" Gaza and resettle Palestinians in Jordan and Egypt, drawing condemnation from regional leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Mahmud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, issued a "strong rejection and condemnation of any projects" aimed at displacing Palestinians from Gaza, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any attempt to move them from Gaza would evoke dark memories of what the Arab world calls the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of Palestinians during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We say to Trump and the whole world: we will not leave Palestine or Gaza, no matter what happens," said displaced Gaza resident Rashad al-Naji.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had floated the idea to reporters Saturday aboard Air Force One: "You're talking about probably a million and half people, and we just clean out that whole thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Moving Gaza's roughly 2.4 million inhabitants could be done "temporarily or could be long term", he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- who opposed the truce deal and has voiced support for re-establishing Israeli settlements in Gaza -- called Trump's suggestion of "a great idea".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arab League rejected the idea, warning against "attempts to uproot the Palestinian people from their land", saying their forced displacement could "only be called ethnic cleansing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said "our rejection of the displacement of Palestinians is firm and will not change. Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians."
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt's foreign ministry said it rejected any infringement of Palestinians' "inalienable rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce has brought a surge of food, fuel, medicines and other aid into rubble-strewn Gaza, but the UN says "the humanitarian situation remains dire".
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war, 87 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 47,306 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

    Jeju Air crash report confirms bird strike

<img alt="Bird feathers and bloodstains were found in both engines of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December, according to a preliminary investigation released on Monday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first report on last month’s Jeju Air crash in South Korea confirmed bird strikes in the plane's engines, though officials haven't determined the cause of the accident that killed all but two of the 181 people on board .
 <br>
  <br>
  The preliminary accident report released on Monday said feathers and bird blood stains were found in both engines.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The samples were sent to specialised organisations for DNA analysis, and a domestic organisation identified them as belonging to Baikal Teals,” the report said, referring to a migratory duck.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said the plane's black box stopped recording about four minutes before the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea earlier announced it would remove a concrete structure at the end of the airport's runway that was involved in the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some experts have said that Muan International Airport’s localiser — a set of antennas in a concrete structure that guide aircraft during landings — likely made the crash of the Jeju Air plane worse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 skidded off the airport’s runaway on December 29 after its landing gear failed to deploy, slamming into the concrete structure and bursting into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many observers said the structure should have been made with lighter materials that could break more easily upon impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have said that air traffic controllers warned the pilot about possible bird strikes two minutes before the aircraft issued a distress signal confirming that a bird strike had occurred, after which the pilot attempted an emergency landing. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House said on Sunday that Colombia had backed down and agreed to accept repatriated citizens on military flights, after US President Donald Trump threatened major sanctions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Afterwards, Colombia said it had "overcome the impasse" with Washington in the row over the reception of migrants deported from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue receiving Colombians who return as deportees," Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo said at a news conference after Bogota blocked the entry of US planes carrying deported Colombians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had threatened sanctions of 25 percent that would quickly scale up to 50 percent against Latin America's fourth largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia has agreed to "unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on US military aircraft, without limitation or delay," a White House statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's events make clear to the world that America is respected again," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump will continue to fiercely protect our nation's sovereignty, and he expects all other nations of the world to fully cooperate in accepting the deportation of their citizens illegally present in the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a leftist, had infuriated Trump by refusing to accept military planes of Colombians deported from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had earlier said he would take back migrants but "with dignity," including on civilian planes. (AFP)

    Trump vows tariffs, sanctions on Colombia over flights

<img alt="US President Donald Trump (Left) and Colombian President Gustavo Petro are at loggerheads over mass deportations of migrants by Washington. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789231_1_20250127031851.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump vowed on Sunday to hit Colombia with steep tariffs and other sanctions after his counterpart Gustavo Petro blocked deportation flights from the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Petro's denial of these flights has jeopardized the National Security and Public Safety of the United States, so I have directed my Administration to immediately take the following urgent and decisive retaliatory measures," Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He listed "25 percent tariffs," a travel ban on Colombian government officials, and invoking sanctions under emergency presidential powers -- among several other severe responses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia's refusal to accept the flights is the second case of a Latin American nation refusing US military deportation flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals," Petro wrote, noting that there were 15,660 Americans without proper immigration status in Colombia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Petro's comments add to the growing chorus of discontent in Latin America as Trump's week-old administration starts mobilising for mass deportations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil's foreign ministry late on Saturday condemned "degrading treatment" of Brazilians after migrants were handcuffed on a commercial deportation flight. Upon arrival, some of the passengers also reported mistreatment during the flight, according to local news reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane, which was carrying 88 Brazilian passengers, 16 US security agents, and eight crew members, had been originally scheduled to arrive in Belo Horizonte in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais.
  <br>
  <br>
  There, Brazilian officials ordered the removal of the handcuffs, and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva designated a Brazilian Air Force (FAB) flight to complete their journey, the government said in a statement Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commercial charter flight was the second this year from the US carrying undocumented migrants deported back to Brazil and the first since Trump's inauguration, according to Brazil's federal police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The use of US military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is part of the Pentagon's response to Trump's national emergency declaration on immigration on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past, US military aircraft have been used to relocate individuals from one country to another, like during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  This has been the first time in recent memory that US military aircraft were used to fly migrants out of the country, one American official said. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli army fire killed 22 people in south Lebanon on Sunday including a soldier, health officials said, as residents tried to return home on the day Israel was meant to withdraw under a truce deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The withdrawal deadline is part of a ceasefire agreement reached two months ago that ended Israel's war with Iran-backed Hezbollah, which had left the Lebanese militant group weakened.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal that took effect on November 27 said the Lebanese army was to deploy alongside United Nations peacekeepers in the south as the Israeli army withdrew over a 60-day period that ends on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parties have traded blame for the delay in implementing the agreement, and on Friday Israel said it would keep troops across the border in south Lebanon beyond the pullout date.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon's health ministry said on Sunday that Israeli forces opened fire on "citizens who were trying to return to their villages that are still under (Israeli) occupation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said in a statement that its "troops operating in southern Lebanon fired warning shots to remove threats" where "suspects were identified approaching the troops".
  <br>
  <br>
  A joint statement from the UN special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, and the head of the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission acknowledged that "as seen tragically this morning, conditions are not yet in place for the safe return of citizens to their villages". (AFP)

    Yoon Suk-yeol indicted on insurrection charges

<img alt="President Yoon is accused of being a 'ringleader of insurrection' over the short-lived imposition of martial law on December 3. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789208_1_20250126184414.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's prosecutors indicted President Yoon Su-yeol on Sunday on charges of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law on December 3, the main opposition party said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The prosecution has decided to indict Yoon Suk-yeol, who is facing charges of being a ringleader of insurrection," Democratic Party spokesman Han Min-soo told a press conference. "The punishment of the ringleader of insurrection now begins finally."
  <br>
  <br>
  The indictment was also reported by South Korean media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-corruption investigators last week recommended charging the jailed Yoon, who was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties over the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers had urged the prosecutors to immediately release the him from what they call illegal custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under criminal investigation, he has been in custody since becoming the first sitting president to be arrested on January 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon and his lawyers argued at a Constitutional Court hearing last week in his impeachment trial that he never intended to fully impose martial law but had only meant the measures as a warning to break political deadlock.
  <br>
  <br>
  In parallel with his criminal process, the top court will determine whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate his presidential powers, with 180 days to decide.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's opposition-led parliament impeached Yoon on December 14, making him the second conservative president to be impeached in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon rescinded his martial law after about six hours after lawmakers from the main opposition party, confronting soldiers in parliament, voted down the decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers equipped with rifles, body armour and night-vision equipment, were seen entering the parliament building through smashed windows during the dramatic confrontation. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Jordan and Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza, where Israel's war against Hamas has caused a humanitarian crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I said to him I’d love you to take on more because I’m looking at the whole Gaza strip right now and it’s a mess, it’s a real mess. I’d like him to take people," Trump said about his call on Saturday with Jordan's King Abdullah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’d like Egypt to take people," Trump told reporters, adding he would speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after the October 7 attack by the Hamas, when militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's campaign has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health authorities there. More than 400 Israeli soldiers have also died in Gaza combat. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea has conducted a strategic cruise missile test, state media KCNA reported on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The country's leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the test on Saturday, according to the report which described it as a test-fire of an "important weapon system."
  <br>
  <br>
  The strategic cruise missiles traveled 1,500 kilometers and flew between 7,507 and 7,511 seconds before hitting their targets, KCNA reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea's war deterrence means were being "perfected more thoroughly," Kim was quoted as saying, while the leader also vowed to continue efforts to strengthen the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Kim Jong Un affirmed that the DPRK will always make strenuous efforts...to perform its important mission and duty for defending sustainable and lasting peace and stability on the basis of more powerfully developed military muscle in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The DPRK stands for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said the missile test was part of plans to build national defence capabilities against potential enemies in line with changing regional safety circumstances. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian militants and Israel carried out a hostage-prisoner swap on Saturday under a Gaza ceasefire deal, but a last-minute dispute blocked the expected return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to devastated northern Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of the exchange, the second since the truce took effect last Sunday, four freed Israeli women hostages, all soldiers, arrived home in Israel after more than 15 months of captivity in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  In exchange, Israel's prison service confirmed that 200 prisoners, whom it called "terrorists", were freed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli captives, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy, all aged 20, and Liri Albag, 19, waved, smiled, and gave thumbs up as they were paraded on a stage in Gaza City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masked and armed militants flanked them during a ceremony watched by hundreds of residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tel Aviv, where a crowd gathered to watch their release on a large TV screen at a plaza known as Hostage Square, there were tears of joy, applause and a loud cheer as Israeli flags waved.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their handover to the Red Cross, Israel's military said the women were transferred back into Israel and "reunited with their parents".
  <br>
  <br>
  Buses carrying the released Palestinians left Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank and Ktziot prison in the Negev desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  As dozens of the former prisoners reached the West Bank city of Ramallah, crowds of Palestinians erupted in joy, raising many of them onto their shoulders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas’ political bureau had said on Friday that Palestinians displaced by the war to southern Gaza should have been able to begin returning to the north following Saturday's releases.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel on Saturday said it would block such returns until civilian woman hostage Arbel Yehud is released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said she "was supposed to be released today" but a Hamas source has said Yehud will be "released as part of the third swap set for next Saturday". (AFP)

<img alt='Pete Hegseth has pledged to focus the military on "lethality" and to bring back "warrior culture" to the Pentagon. File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789114_1_20250125153744.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate narrowly confirmed former Fox News co-host Pete Hegseth as Pentagon chief on Friday, despite allegations of alcohol abuse, sexual misconduct and other fears about his ability to lead the world's most powerful military.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three Republican senators voted against Donald Trump's pick as secretary of defense, resulting in a 50-50 tie that required JD Vance to cast the deciding ballot – only the second time in history a vice president has had to intervene to save a cabinet nominee.
  <br>
  <br>
  The razor-edged result underscored concerns about Hegseth, who will take over the Pentagon with war raging in Ukraine, the Middle East volatile despite ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza, and as Trump expands the military's role in security on the US-Mexico border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 44-year-old is a former Army National Guard officer who until recently worked as a co-host for Fox News – one of Trump's favoured television channels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth has a combative media personality, fierce loyalty and telegenic looks – common hallmarks in Trump's entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters say Hegseth's deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq give him the insight to run the Defense Department better than more experienced officials who would normally be considered for the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has pledged to focus the military on "lethality" and to bring back "warrior culture" to the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  In confirming him, Republicans brushed aside his lack of experience leading an organisation anywhere near the size of the Defense Department – the country's largest employer with some three million personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also approved Hegseth despite allegations of financial mismanagement at veterans' nonprofits where he previously worked, reports of excessive drinking, and allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked during his confirmation hearing last week about criticism he has faced, Hegseth said there was a "coordinated smear campaign" against him, and that he is "not a perfect person, but redemption is real".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has stood by him, telling reporters on Friday: "Pete's a very, very good man."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after he was confirmed, Trump wrote on his Social Truth platform: "Congratulations to Pete Hegseth. He will make a great Secretary of Defense!" (AFP)

    Trump Administration freezes foreign aid

<img alt="US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has sent an internal memo effectively freezing most US foreign aid. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789082_1_20250125091823.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States, the world's biggest donor, froze virtually all foreign aid on Friday, making exceptions only for emergency food, and military funding for Israel and Egypt.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary of State Marco Rubio sent an internal memo days after President Donald Trump took office vowing an "America First" policy of tightly restricting assistance overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No new funds shall be obligated for new awards or extensions of existing awards until each proposed new award or extension has been reviewed and approved," said the memo to staff seen by AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sweeping order appears to affect everything from development assistance to military aid -- including to Ukraine, which received billions of dollars in weapons under Trump's predecessor Joe Biden as it tries to repel a Russian invasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The directive also means a pause of at least several months of US funding for PEPFAR, the anti-HIV/AIDS initiative that buys anti-retroviral drugs to treat the disease in developing countries, largely in Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched under president George W. Bush in 2003, PEPFAR is credited with saving some 26 million lives and until recently enjoyed broad popular support along partisan lines in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the memo explicitly made exceptions for military assistance to Israel -- whose longstanding major arms packages from the United States have expanded further since the Gaza war -- and Egypt, which has received generous US defense funding since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also made an exception for US contributions to emergency food assistance, which the United States ahs been contributing following crises around the world including in Sudan and Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers from the rival Democratic Party said that more than 20 million people relied on medication through PEPFAR and 63 million people on US-funded anti-malaria efforts including nets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For years, Republicans in Congress have decried what they see as a lack of US credibility vis-a-vis countries like China, Russia, and Iran," said Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Lois Frankel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now our credibility is on the line, and it appears we will cut and run from American commitments to our partners around the world," they wrote in a letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington has long leveraged aid as a tool of its foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meeks and Frankel also noted that foreign assistance is appropriated by Congress and said they would seek its implementation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo allows the State Department to make other case-by-case exceptions and temporarily to fund salaries to staff and other administrative expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo called for an internal review of all foreign assistance within 85 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In justifying the freeze, Rubio -- who as a senator was a supporter of development assistance -- wrote that it was impossible for the new administration to assess whether existing foreign aid commitments "are not duplicated, are effective and are consistent with President Trump's foreign policy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has long been the world's top donor in dollar terms, although a number of European nations, especially in Scandinavia, give significantly more as a percent of their economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States gave more than US$64 billion in overseas development assistance in 2023, the last year for which records were available, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which advises industrialised countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had already on taking office Monday signed an executive order suspending foreign assistance for 90 days, but it was not immediately clear how it would be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-poverty group Oxfam said that Trump was abandoning a longstanding consensus in the United States for foreign assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Humanitarian and development assistance accounts for only around one percent of the federal budget; it saves lives, fights diseases, educates millions of children and reduces poverty," Oxfam America president Abby Maxman said in a statement. (AFP)

    Japan's interest rates highest in 17 years

<img alt="Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda told a news conference that the pace and timing of future hikes was yet to be determined. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789025_1_20250124192649.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised interest rates on Friday to their highest in 17 years and signalled more hikes to come, sending the yen higher against the greenback.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25-basis-point rise to 0.5 percent comes as data indicated the Japanese economy was developing in line with BoJ expectations and followed another bumper inflation reading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move, which leaves borrowing costs at the highest since 2008, was also underpinned by "steadily" rising wages and financial markets being "stable on the whole", the BoJ said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan's economic activity and prices have been developing generally in line with the Bank's outlook, and the likelihood of realising the outlook has been rising," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If its outlook is met, "the bank will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  BoJ chief Kazuo Ueda told a news conference the pace and timing of future hikes was yet to be determined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to make a decision after we have studied the impact of this rate hike," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hawkish comments sent the yen up as much as 0.7 percent against the US dollar to 154.84 yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even as other central banks have raised borrowing costs in recent years -- and started cutting again in 2024 -- the BoJ has remained an outlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it concluded last March that Japan's "lost decades" of economic stagnation and static, or falling prices were over, finally lifting rates above zero.
  <br>
  <br>
  That increase was followed by another in July that caught investors off guard and sparked turmoil in global equity and currency markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time Ueda prepared markets for an increase -- some 75 percent of economists expected one -- and the reaction was more muted on Friday. (AFP)

    Record winds as violent storm lashes Ireland and UK

<img alt="Waves break against the sea wall in Carnlough in Northern Ireland, as Storm Eowyn brings winds of 100mph to the UK and Ireland. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788988_1_20250124172954.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Record high winds from Storm Eowyn battered Ireland and Northern Ireland on Friday, leaving 560,000 homes and businesses without power and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the closure of schools and public transport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials had warned the storm was set to be one of the most dangerous they have faced and told people to stay indoors. The Irish weather agency, Met Eireann, said a gust of 182 kilometres per hour overnight at Mace Head in County Galway provisionally broke an 80-year record.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESB Networks, which provides energy for the whole of Ireland, said "unprecedented" damage to its network had led to power outages affecting 560,000 homes, farms and businesses. It expected significant outages as the storm tracks northwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The power company said ahead of the storm that it could take up to nine days to restore power for some customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 110 scheduled departures and 110 arrivals at Dublin airport were cancelled, the airport said, adding that further cancellations and delays were possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  All schools in Ireland and Northern Ireland were closed on Friday and public transport will not run in Ireland while a red wind warning remains in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The red warning - the highest alert level - was in place for the entire country for the first time since Storm Ophelia in 2017, which killed three people.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is due to be lifted for most of Ireland at 1100 GMT and in British-ruled Northern Ireland at 1400.
  <br>
  <br>
  A red warning is also in place for southwestern and central areas of Scotland from 10am until 5pm GMT, the UK Met Office said, warning people to expect flying debris resulting in danger to life, damage to buildings with roofs blown off and the closure of roads and bridges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of flights from airports at Edinburgh and Glasgow were cancelled, and National Rail advised people living across Scotland and parts of northern England not to travel on Friday. (Reuters)

    'Blatantly unconstitutional' birthright order blocked

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge blocked Donald Trump's attempt to restrict birthright citizenship in the United States on Thursday as liberal states scored their first victory against the new president's hardline agenda.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ruling imposes a 14-day stay on the enforcement of one of the most controversial executive orders Trump signed in the hours after he was sworn into office for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a blatantly unconstitutional order," US District Judge John Coughenour was reported as saying during the hearing in Washington state.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been on the bench for over four decades, I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one is," said Coughenour, who was appointed by a Republican president, Ronald Reagan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters his administration would "obviously" appeal the ruling, while the Department of Justice said it would defend the executive order, which a spokesman said "correctly interprets" the US Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the court and to the American people, who are desperate to see our nation's laws enforced," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Birthright citizenship is enshrined in the US Constitution under the 14th Amendment which decrees that anyone born on US soil is a citizen.
  <br>
  <br>
  It says, in part: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order was premised on the idea that anyone in the United States illegally, or on a visa, was not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the country, and therefore excluded from this category.
  <br>
  <br>
  An incredulous Coughenour chided Justice Department attorney Brett Shumate over his assertion that Trump's order was constitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Frankly, I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar could state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order," Coughenour said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just boggles my mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling comes after a flurry of lawsuits filed by 22 states, two cities and numerous civil rights groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was hailed by states that took part in the legal actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No president can change the constitution on a whim and today's decision affirms that," Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling is "the first of many wins to come as my office fights instances of executive overreach and any illegal actions the new administration may take."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said Trump's order was "un-American."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Birthright citizenship makes clear that citizenship cannot be conditioned on one's race, ethnicity or where their parents came from," he said after the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the law of our nation, recognised by generations of jurists, lawmakers and presidents, until President Trump's illegal action."
  <br>
  <br>
  The legal challenge was no surprise, and Trump had acknowledged it was likely when he signed the order.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has repeatedly – and wrongly – asserted that the United States is the only country in the world with birthright citizenship; in fact more than 30 others also have it, including Canada and Mexico. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said his conversation with President Xi Jinping last week was friendly, and he thought he could reach a trade deal with China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders of the world's two biggest economies discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan in a phone call before Trump took office on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking office, Trump has spoken about a 10 percent punitive duty on Chinese imports. He has also threatened tariffs against the European Union, Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went fine. It was a good, friendly conversation," Trump said of his call with President Xi in an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can do that," Trump said when asked if he could make a deal with China over fair trade practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would rather not use tariffs against China but called tariffs a "tremendous power."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we have one very big power over China, and that's tariffs, and they don't want them, and I'd rather not have to use it, but it's a tremendous power over China," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has vowed to defend its national interests over Trump's threat to impose the duty, with the Foreign Ministry saying there are no winners in a trade or tariff war. (Reuters and agencies)

    New wildfire north of LA threatens tens of thousands

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 50,000 people were under evacuation orders or warnings on Wednesday as a huge and fast-moving wildfire swept through the rugged mountains north of Los Angeles.
 <br>
  <br>
  But fire officials said a rapid ground and air assault was giving them the upper hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hughes Fire broke out in the late morning and within six hours charred about 15 square miles (39 square kilometres) of trees and brush near Lake Castaic, a popular recreation area about 40 miles (64 kilometres) from the devastating Eaton and Palisades fires that are burning for a third week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the region was under a red flag warning, winds were not as fast as they had been when those fires broke out, allowing for firefighting aircraft to dump tens of thousands of gallons of fire retardant.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The situation that we’re in today is very different from the situation we were in 16 days ago,” Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said on Wednesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no reported homes or other structures burned.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This fire had a robust response today, and as you can see behind us, the responders are doing great work to try to contain this fire," Joe Tyler, director of Cal Fire, said. “Certainly, we are not out of the woods yet.”
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 31,000 people have been ordered to evacuate, and another 23,000 are under evacuation warnings, LA County Sheriff Robert Luna said.

 Hundreds of LGBT couples in Thailand are expected to make their wedded status legal on Thursday, the first day a law took effect granting them the same rights as heterosexual couples.

  The enactment of the Marriage Equality Act makes Thailand the first country in Southeast Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marriage registration is customarily done at district offices, but on Thursday, around 300 couples were expected to complete the formalities at a day-long gala celebration in an exhibition hall at a shopping mall in central Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds more are predicted to register in less fancy circumstances around the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marriage equality bill, which sailed through both houses of parliament, amended the Civil and Commercial Code to change the words “men and women” and “husband and wife” to “individuals” and “marriage partners.” It is supposed to open up access to full legal, financial and medical rights for LGBT couples.
  <br>
  <br>
  Partners will have equal rights and responsibilities in dealing with joint assets, tax obligations and deductions, inheritance rights and survivor benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok’s city government has said that it organised workshops for staff of all its district offices who are in charge of handling marriage registration.
  <br>
  <br>
  They included lectures raising awareness about gender diversity and guidance on how to properly communicate with those who come for the service. The Interior Ministry has offered similar guidance. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Anger was growing in Turkey on Wednesday as allegations piled up that negligence played a role in the deaths of 79 people who perished when a huge fire swept through a luxury ski resort hotel in northern Turkey.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the nation observing a day of mourning, grieving families began burying their dead as questions multiplied about fire safety measures at the 12-storey Grand Kartal Hotel perched on a mountaintop in the Kartalkaya resort.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire, which began in the dead of night, struck at peak season for the Grand Kartal Hotel, which had 238 guests staying at the start of a two-week winter break.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a funeral in the nearby town of Bolu for eight members of the same family who died in the blaze, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan could be seen wiping away tears, his head bowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a freezing foggy morning, with flags flying at half-mast, rescuers resumed their search of the charred and blackened structure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those being buried was a neurologist, his wife and their three children, including twin boys.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze broke out around 3:30am local time, sending huge clouds of smoke into the night air and sparking panic among the guests, many of whom tried to climb out of the windows, using bedsheets as ropes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw one kid hanging from the hotel window calling for help," said Islam, who works at a nearby hotel and did not give his surname.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was profoundly disturbed. I still cannot forget the image," he said, adding he knew some of the hotel staff who died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said nine people, including the owner, had been arrested in connection with the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism Minister Nuri Ersoy said on Tuesday the hotel had two fire escapes and had passed inspections in 2021 and 2024. (AFP)

    Prince Harry settles Murdoch tabloid lawsuit

<div class="itemFullText">
 Prince Harry settled on Wednesday his long-running lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch's UK tabloid publisher, which agreed to pay him "substantial damages" after admitting intruding into his private life, including by hacking his phone.
 <br>
  <br>
  Murdoch's News Group Newspapers (NGN) issued a wide-ranging apology and admission of wrongdoing, in what Harry's lawyer David Sherborne called "a monumental victory" that underlined the need for further probes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The publisher apologised to him for the impact of the "serious intrusion" into the private life of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, particularly when he was younger.
  <br>
  <br>
  The settlement won by King Charles's youngest son concludes a years-long legal battle over claims of unlawful practices by two of Murdoch's newspapers -- The Sun and now-shuttered News of the World.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also avoids a High Court trial in the public spotlight, which had been due to begin on Tuesday and last up to eight weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "NGN offers a full and unequivocal apology... for the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life," an NGN statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included the unlawful activities of private investigators working for the tabloid, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also apologised for the "phone hacking, surveillance and misuse of private information" by journalists and private investigators working for the News of the World.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acknowledging the damage inflicted on Harry's "relationships, friendships and family", it said it would pay him "substantial damages". (AFP)

    'Thailand remains a safe destination for all'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials in Thailand on Wednesday stressed that the country remains "a safe destination for all international visitors", following reports of Hong Kong residents being lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Royal Thai Consulate-General in Hong Kong also expressed its deep regret, saying it understands what happened had raised concern about the safety among SAR travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to assure that Thailand remains a safe destination for all international visitors since none of the victims are tourists. They were misled by scammers to travel to Thailand to work in high-paying jobs but ended up being escorted across the border to the scam centres," a consulate spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten Hongkongers are believed to still be held captive in the region and forced to work in so-called scam farms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai authorities have taken steps to tackle transnational crimes and human trafficking that "will help reassure international tourists and visitors of their safety", the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include addressing misinformation online, ensuring sufficient police deployment in high-risk areas, and introducing a two-level boundary control system along the eastern and western borders across 14 provinces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Thai officials had also met their Chinese and Myanmar counterparts in Kunming and "reached positive consensus on eradicating the scam centres in Myanmar", the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Thai government posted an AI-generated video of its prime minister speaking in Mandarin, encouraging Chinese tourists to visit the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the clip posted to the government's Facebook page, a likeness of Paetongtarn Shinawatra appeared to speak in fluent Mandarin, a language that the prime minister does not speak in real life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The character emphasised at the start of the video that it had been made with AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand that recent reports of Chinese nationals being lured to scam compounds around Thailand's borders have triggered concerns among Chinese tourists... Thailand's government puts the safety of all tourists as its utmost priority," the AI Paetongtarn said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian rescuers retrieved two more bodies after they resumed their search on Wednesday for people missing after floods and landslides on Indonesia’s main island of Java, bringing the death toll to 19.
 <br>
  <br>
  Waters from flooded rivers tore through nine villages in Pekalongan regency of Central Java province and landslides tumbled onto mountainside hamlets after the torrential rains Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said flooding triggered a landslide that buried two houses and a cafe in Petungkriyono resort area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The disasters all together destroyed 25 houses, a dam and three main bridges connecting villages in Pekalongan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 300 people were forced to flee to temporary government shelters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The search and rescue operation that was hampered by bad weather, mudslides and rugged terrain was halted on Tuesday afternoon due to heavy rain and thick fog that made devastated areas along the rivers dangerous to rescuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, they searched in rivers and the rubble of villages for bodies and, whenever possible, survivors in worst-hit Kasimpar village, said Budiono, who heads a local rescue office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scores of rescue personnel were searching through a Petungkriyono area where tons of mud and rocks buried two houses and a café to search for at least nine people reported missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos and photos released by National Search and Rescue Agency showed personnel digging desperately in villages where roads and green-terraced rice fields were transformed into murky brown mud and villages were covered by thick mud, rocks and uprooted trees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landslides and floods were also reported in many other provinces, Muhari said. On Monday, a landslide hit five houses in Denpasar on the tourist island of Bali, killing four people and leaving one missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile floodplains. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration is directing that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave, and that agencies develop plans to lay them off, according to a memo from the Office of Personnel Management.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday that asks government agency chiefs to combat Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies in federal agencies, contracting and the private sector, the White House said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order also encouraged the private sector to "end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences," the White House added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The action outlined in an Office of Personnel Management memorandum came one day after Trump issued a series of executive orders to end diversity programmes, which attempt to promote opportunities for women, ethnic minorities, LGBT people and other traditionally under-represented groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government should by the end of business on Wednesday inform employees of any government offices or units focused exclusively on DEI that their programmes will be shut down and employees placed on leave, the memorandum said.
  <br>
  <br>
  By Thursday, federal agencies are directed to compile a list of federal DEI offices and workers as of Election Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  By next Friday, they are expected to develop a plan to execute a “reduction-in-force action” against those federal workers. (Agencies)

    Rubio starts as US top diplomat with Quad meeting

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States, Australia, India and Japan recommitted to working together on Tuesday, after the first meeting of the Quad grouping's top diplomats since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement after the talks in Washington, hosted by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on his first day in the job, the four nations said officials would meet regularly to prepare for an upcoming leaders' summit in India, expected this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio earlier said he said would stress the importance of working with allies "on the things that are important to America and Americans" during the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He posed with Australia's Penny Wong, India's Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Japan's Takeshi Iwaya in front of the flags of their countries before the meeting at the State Department, but did not respond to questions from reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significant that the Quad (foreign ministers' meeting) took place within hours of the inauguration of the Trump Administration," Jaishankar said on X after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This underlines the priority it has in the foreign policy of its member states."
  <br>
  <br>
  The four nations restated their "shared commitment to strengthening a Free and Open Indo-Pacific where the rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty, and territorial integrity are upheld and defended," the joint statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also met separately with the three foreign ministers on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Foreign Minister Wong told a news conference in Washington she had a "very positive discussion" with Rubio on Aukus, a trilateral security partnership that also involves the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has denounced the Quad as a Cold War construct and a political tool for the US to contain China and maintain its hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has also said the Aukus alliance would intensify a regional arms race and undermine peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific. (Reuters)

    Panama complains to UN over Trump canal threat

<img alt="Panamanian authorities have launched an audit of the Hong Kong-linked operator of two Panama Canal ports, aimed at ensuring the efficient and transparent use of public resources. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788620_1_20250122100432.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panama has complained to the United Nations over US President Donald Trump's "worrying" threat to seize the Panama Canal, even as it launched an audit of the Hong Kong-linked operator of two ports on the inter-oceanic waterway.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the government in Panama City referred to an article of the UN Charter precluding any member from "the threat or use of force" against the territorial integrity or political independence of another.
  <br>
  <br>
  The missive distributed to reporters on Tuesday urges Guterres to refer the matter to the UN Security Council, without asking for a meeting to be convened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in his inaugural address on Monday, repeated his complaint that China was effectively "operating" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panamanian comptroller's office that oversees public entities then announced an "exhaustive audit" would be launched to ensure the "efficient and transparent use of public resources" at the Panama Ports Company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company, part of Hutchison Ports, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comptroller's office said the aim was to determine whether the company was complying with its concession agreements, including adequate reporting of income, payments and contributions to the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino has denied that any other nation was interfering in the canal, which he said operated on the principle of neutrality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal is and will remain Panama's," Mulino said in response to Trump's threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, at a Foreign Ministry briefing on Wednesday, spokeswoman Mao Ning said China has not participated in the management and operation of the Panama Canal, and has never intervened in the canal's affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said Beijing respects Panama's sovereignty over the canal and recognises it as a permanently neutral international waterway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Ports Company's concession agreement was extended by 25 years in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States is the canal's main user, followed by China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2000, the waterway has contributed more than US$30 billion to Panama's state coffers, including nearly US$2.5 billion in the last fiscal year. (AFP/Xinhua)

 US President Donald Trump pledged on Tuesday to hit the European Union with tariffs, adding that a 10 percent duty on Chinese imports could also come as soon as February 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump voiced his latest tariff threats in remarks to reporters at the White House a day after taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They treat us very, very badly. So they're going to be in for tariffs," Trump said of the EU. "You can't get fairness unless you do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  A day earlier, Trump accused the bloc of not importing enough American products, saying he would "straighten that out" by imposing duties or by urging for more oil and gas purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding China, Trump on Tuesday reiterated his threat to impose a 10 percent tariff, saying it was "based on the fact that they're sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked how soon these tariffs could be enacted, he added: "Probably February 1st is the date we're looking at."
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the same date he earlier said he could impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, accusing them of failing to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's economy commissioner vowed this week that the bloc was ready to defend its interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an annual meeting of global elites in Davos, Switzerland, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen declared that Europe was ready to negotiate with Trump, while maintaining that Washington remained an important partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's "first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests, and be ready to negotiate" with Trump, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles, to protect our interests and uphold our values," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, following Trump's announcement of additional tariffs, mainland media accused him of blaming China for Washington's failure to address the fentanyl crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Daily said scapegoating others cannot end the drug crisis in the US, while the Global Times urged Washington not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has spoken out against protectionism, saying no one wins in a trade war. (AFP)

    Trump 'open' to Elon Musk buying TikTok

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would be open to tech billionaire Elon Musk - the owner of social media platform X - buying Chinese-owned app TikTok.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I would be if he wanted to buy it," Trump told reporters when asked if he was open to Musk, the world's richest man and the head of a budget-cutting initiative in the new administration, acquiring the video-sharing platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok is facing down a US law that ordered the company to divest from its Chinese owner ByteDance or be banned in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one of his first acts in office, Trump ordered a pause on enforcing the law that should have seen TikTok effectively made illegal in the country on Sunday, a day before he took office for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive order directed his attorney general to delay the implementation of the law for 75 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  To save the company's US operations, Trump on Monday also floated the idea of a 50-50 partnership between "the United States" and its Chinese owner ByteDance, though he did not provide details on how this could be achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked on Tuesday if his phone had TikTok, which is banned on US government devices, Trump said: "No, but... I think I'll get it right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok briefly shut down in the United States late Saturday as the law's sale deadline approached, leaving millions of dismayed users barred from the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the tacit co-operation of Oracle, its server provider, TikTok restored service in the United States on Sunday crediting Trump's commitment to save the app for making the reversal possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even if existing users can still enjoy TikTok, Apple and Google have still not made the app available in their app stores, therefore denying downloads to new users as well as updates to those who have it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Companies that violate the law, which remains officially in effect, face penalties of up to US$5,000 per user if the app is accessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, a report that Chinese officials were considering selling the company's US operations to Musk's social media platform X was met with a firm denial from TikTok. (AFP)

    Trump highlights billion-dollar AI partnership

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Japanese tech behemoth SoftBank Group soared more than eight per cent on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump announced a major investment to build AI infrastructure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said that ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle are planning a joint venture called Stargate, which he said would build data centres and create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  These companies, along with other equity backers of Stargate, have committed US$100 billion for immediate deployment, with the remaining investment expected to occur over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison joined Trump at the White House for the launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of the project's data centres are already under construction in Texas, Ellison said at the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty will be built, half-a-million square feet each, he said. The project could power AI that analyses electronic health records and helps doctors care for their patients, Ellison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear whether the announcement was an update to a previously reported venture.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March 2024, The Information, a technology news website, reported OpenAI and Microsoft were working on plans for a US$100 billion data centre project that would include an artificial intelligence supercomputer, also called "Stargate", set to launch in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on Trump's second day in office follows the rolling back of former President Joe Biden's executive order on AI, that was intended to reduce the risks that AI poses to consumers, workers and national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oracle shares were up seven per cent on an initial report of the project earlier in the day. Nvidia, Arm Holdings and Dell shares also rose. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's army chief Herzi Halevi said on Tuesday he would resign on March 6, taking responsibility for the security lapse on October 7, 2023, when Palestinian Hamas fighters from Gaza carried out a cross-border attack on Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Halevi, who had been widely expected to step down in the wake of the deadliest single day in Israel's history, said he would complete the Israel Defence Forces' inquiries into October 7 and strengthen the IDF's readiness for security challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear who would replace Halevi, who said he would transfer the IDF command to a yet-to-be-named successor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite public anger over the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has resisted calls to open a state inquiry into its own responsibility for the security breach that resulted in 1,200 Israelis being killed and about 250 hostages taken.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address, Halevi promised a deep and transparent investigation, the details of which would be presented to the defence minister and, as much as permissible, to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of senior military officers have already resigned over October 7, and the head of the military's Southern Command, Major-General Yaron Finkelman, also said he would be resigning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe our prime minister should take example from the personal responsibility that the chief of staff has taken," activist Gil Ashkenazy, 60, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 46,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's war in Gaza, and the heavily built-up territory has been widely demolished by Israeli bombardments and airstrikes. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a fire that engulfed a hotel at a popular ski resort in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday rose to 76, officials said, expressing great "pain" at the tragedy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses said desperate guests had tried to escape using ropes, footage showed bedsheets hanging from the windows, and media reports suggest some had died after trying to jump to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pain is great," Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya told reporters at the resort in Kartalkaya, around 170 kilometres northwest of the capital Ankara.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze broke out at 3:27 am (0027 GMT) in the 12-storey Grand Kartal hotel, which has wooden cladding, Yerlikaya said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 238 guests were registered at the hotel, the minister added. It was a peak time during a two-week school holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkish authorities detained four suspects including the owner of the resort hotel, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister previously announced that six prosecutors had been allocated to investigate the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private broadcaster NTV said that the dead included three people who had jumped from the hotel's windows.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire is believed to have started in the restaurant and spread quickly, though it was not immediately clear what caused it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of the structure backs onto a cliff, making it harder for firefighters to tackle the blaze. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang warned on Tuesday that no country would emerge victorious from a trade war, in a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos as Donald Trump returned to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, told the forum that a "tug of war" was underway between supporters and opponents of economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Transformation not seen in a century is accelerating across the board with imminent tariff wars and trade wars.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global governance system is undergoing profound adjustments. Human society has once again come to a critical crossroads.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Protectionism leads nowhere, and there are no winners in a trade war," Ding said, without mentioning Trump or the US by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has also been locked in trade disputes with the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU imposed hefty tariffs on electric cars made in China last year. In turn, Beijing targeted European brandies and opened probes into EU subsidies of some dairy and pork products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without mentioning the EU or any country by name, Ding warned against "erecting green barriers that could disrupt normal economic and trade cooperation".
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for a "consistent approach" in addressing climate change and trade policies "so as to prevent economic and trade frictions from impeding the process of green transition".
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe was ready to improve ties with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed that Europe "must engage constructively with China – to find solutions in our mutual interest" despite escalating trade tensions between the two. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 10 people were killed and another 32 injured after a fire broke out at a hotel at a ski resort in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out overnight at the hotel's restaurant in the resort of Kartalkaya in Bolu province, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the victims died after jumping out of the building in a panic, Governor Abdulaziz Aydin told the state-run Anadolu Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private NTV television said some people tried to climb down from their rooms using sheets.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 234 guests staying at the hotel, Aydin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Necmi Kepcetutan, a ski instructor at the hotel, said he was asleep when the fire erupted and he rushed out of the building. He told NTV television that he then helped some 20 guests out of the hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the hotel was engulfed in smoke, making it difficult for guests to locate the fire escape.
  <br>
  <br>
  Television images showed the roof and top floors of the hotel on fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the fire was not immediately known. NTV television suggested that the wooden cladding on the hotel's exterior may have accelerated the spread of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kartalkaya is a popular ski resort in the Koroglu mountains, some 300 kilometres east of Istanbul. The fire occurred during the school semester break when hotels in the region are packed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aydin's office said 30 fire trucks and 28 ambulances were sent to the site. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese stocks and the yuan tentatively rose on Tuesday, with investors relieved that US President Donald Trump did not announce hefty trade tariffs at his inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump returned to the White House on Monday with an ambitious agenda spanning trade reform, immigration, tax cuts and deregulation. He did not target China in his inauguration speech nor did he immediately impose tariffs as previously promised, sparking a relief rally in global stocks and a drop in the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, Trump directed federal agencies to "investigate and remedy" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries, and said he might impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re thinking in terms of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada,” Trump said late on Monday night in the Oval Office. “I think February 1.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian leaders earlier expressed relief the tariffs were not imposed on the first day of Trump taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75 percent of Canada’s exports, which include automobiles and parts, go to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also signed an order on Monday directing agencies to study a host of trade issues including deficits, unfair practices and currency manipulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  These could pave the way for further duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also directed federal agencies to assess China's performance under the Phase 1 trade deal that he signed with Beijing in 2020 during his first term at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal had required China to increase purchases of US exports by US$200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets when the Covid-19 pandemic struck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's start to his presidency "is better than I expected," said Charles Wang, chairman of Shenzhen Dragon Pacific Capital Management Co.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuan Yuwei, founder and chief investment officer of Water Wisdom Asset Management, called Trump's return "marginally positive" and expected the new president to be less stringent in his crackdown on China than predecessor Joe Biden, who "sought to strangle China to death".
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 index has dropped roughly five percent since Trump won the election on November 5 with a threat to impose steep tariffs of 60 percent on Chinese goods, but had already rebounded over the past week amid gestures of goodwill between Beijing and Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump, in his inaugural address, repeated his complaint that China was effectively "operating" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the vital waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back," Trump said after taking the oath inside the US Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama reacted sharply to Trump's pledge, saying the key inter-oceanic waterway would remain under its control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal is and will remain Panama's," President Jose Raul Mulino said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump in his first day back in office on Monday signed an executive order directing the United States to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), and from the Paris climate accord for a second time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the White House hours after his inauguration, Trump said the United States was paying far more to the WHO compared to China, adding: "World Health ripped us off."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, the largest donor to the Geneva-based organisation, provides substantial financial support that is vital to the WHO's operations. Its withdrawal is expected to trigger a significant restructuring of the institution and could further disrupt global health initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following Trump's announcement to exit the agency, the Foreign Ministry said the role of the WHO should only be strengthened, not weakened.
  <br>
  <br>
  China will continue to support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the second time Trump has sought to sever ties with the WHO.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his new executive order, Trump directed agencies to "pause the future transfer of any United States government funds, support, or resources to the WHO" and to "identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also once again withdrew the United States from the Paris climate deal, removing the world's biggest historic emitter from global efforts to fight climate change for the second time in a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move places the United States alongside Iran, Libya and Yemen as the only countries in the world outside the 2015 pact, in which governments agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China is concerned about the US announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting climate change is a common challenge faced by humanity, Guo said no country can stay aloof or unaffected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's determination and actions to actively address climate change remain consistent," he said, adding that the Chinese side will work with all parties to actively tackle the challenges of climate change. (Agencies)

    'Trump's speech has imperialistic overtures'

<img alt="Josef Gregory Mahoney says Donald Trump's inauguration speech had " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788447_1_20250121101535.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international relations professor on Tuesday said Donald Trump’s inauguration speech had "sort of imperialistic overtures".
 <br>
  <br>
  Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai made the remarks on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme as the newly-sworn in US president vowed to “take back” the Panama Canal and potentially rename the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America, and invoked a “manifest destiny” in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One wonders if there's sort of this parallel that Trump is creating with this old 18th century idea of the US controlling the Western Hemisphere, at least the northern part of the Western Hemisphere, in as much as he's made overtures towards Greenland, Canada in terms of imperialistic overtures, but also things related to Mexico and now the Panama Canal and then renaming potentially the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One wonders if he’s creating sort of parallel with China where you have China in the South China Sea, China in the American mind trying to impose its sort of manifest destiny in East Asia.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahoney also pointed out that Trump made a wise move by holding back on tariffs against China, as the implementation would have roiled the markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we all realised that tariffs are lose-lose at this point, that's what almost every study has confirmed,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And that the biggest losers of all are American consumers who end up paying essentially inflationary prices for products as much as they have to bear the costs of the tariffs. And the United States depends much more on products from China than vice versa.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Before taking office, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticised Beijing for violating Hong Kong’s autonomy, saying it was now  a “semi-autonomous entity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahoney believes the statement will spark concerns towards how Washington will treat the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This, you know, raises the spectre about whether or not the United States will start to treat Hong Kong as being part of the mainland and how that could have implications for the special status that Hong Kong has vis-a-vis the United States in terms of financial regulations,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That remains something of serious concern that we'll have to continue to watch. On the one hand, Rubio has said that he's committed to Hong Kong autonomy, but if he's decided that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous, then that raises a whole different perspective.”

    Trump pardons over 1,500 people for Jan 6 riots

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump on Monday pardoned nearly everyone criminally charged with participating in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, in a show of solidarity with supporters who stormed the seat of American power in his name.
 <br>
  <br>
  The far-reaching action also cuts short the sentences of 14 members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers organisations, including some who were convicted of seditious conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document also directs the US attorney general to drop all pending cases related to the riot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What they've done to these people is outrageous," Trump, a Republican, told reporters in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are the hostages - approximately 1,500 people - for a pardon, full pardon," he said at a signing ceremony shortly after arriving at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they come out tonight frankly," he said. "They're expecting it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, whose first term as president ended under the cloud of the Capitol assault, has repeatedly played down the unprecedented violence of January 6, even going so far as to describe it as a "day of love."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 140 police officers were injured in hours of clashes with rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault on the Capitol followed a fiery speech by then-president Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House in which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 race. He then encouraged the crowd to march on Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was charged by special counsel Jack Smith with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the case never made it to trial, and was dropped under the Justice Department's policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the latest figures from the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, 1,583 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol siege, including 608 accused of assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for the former leader of the Proud Boys group, Enrique Tarrio, said he expected his client to be released from federal prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tarrio is serving a 22-year sentence, the longest of anyone criminally charged in the riot, for seditious conspiracy. He was found guilty of plotting to violently oppose the transfer of power after the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for Tarrio's co-defendant, Joe Biggs, said he was also told by an intermediary that Biggs is being processed for release. Biggs, who held a senior post in the Proud Boys, was also convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 17 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Constitution gives presidents broad pardon power and there is no legal mechanism for challenging a presidential pardon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden, before leaving office on Monday, issued pre-emptive pardons to former Covid pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci, retired general Mark Milley and close family members to shield them from "politically-motivated prosecutions" by the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden gave similar pardons to former Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney and other members of the congressional committee that investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just minutes before Trump was sworn in, Biden announced he was issuing pardons to his brother James Biden, James's wife Sara Jones Biden, his sister Valerie Biden Owens, Valerie's husband John Owens, and his brother Francis Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me -- the worst kind of partisan politics," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Windy and dry conditions returned to Southern California on Monday, raising the risk of new wildfires sparking as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area that started in similar weather nearly two weeks ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gusts could peak at 113 kph along the coast and 160 kph in the mountains and foothills during extreme fire weather that is expected to last through Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service issued a warning of a “particularly dangerous situation” for parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties from Monday afternoon until Tuesday morning due to low humidity and damaging Santa Ana winds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities urged people not to mow their lawns to prevent sparking a fire, nor start any fires that could get out of control.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also asked residents to review their evacuation plans and ready emergency kits and be on the lookout for any new blazes and report them quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Acuna, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said the biggest concerns are the Palisades and Eaton Fires breaking their containment lines and a new blaze starting.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Don’t do things to start another fire so we can focus on the mitigation of the current fires,” Acuna said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The low humidity, bone-dry vegetation and strong Santa Ana winds come as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area, the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out during fierce winds on January 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palisades fire was 59 per cent contained on Monday and the Eaton fire 87 per cent contained, according to fire officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump, who was sworn in as US president on Monday, has said he will be visiting the fire-ravaged areas at the end of the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  That trip could include an awkward encounter with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been the target of Trump's barbs over his handling of the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has falsely claimed that Newsom had blocked the diversion of "excess rain and snow melt from the North."
  <br>
  <br>
  In reality, Los Angeles' water supplies are mainly fed via aqueducts and canals originating from entirely separate river basins further east. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 900 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza on Monday, the United Nations said, exceeding the daily target outlined in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Humanitarian aid continues to move into the Gaza Strip as part of a prepared surge to increase support to survivors," the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, 915 trucks crossed into Gaza, according to information received through engagement with Israeli authorities and the guarantors for the ceasefire agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Throughout the conflict in Gaza, the UN has denounced obstacles restricting the flow and distribution of aid into the battered Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, the day the ceasefire came into force, 630 trucks entered Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  An initial 42-day truce between Israel and Hamas is meant to enable a surge of sorely needed aid for Gaza after 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire agreement calls for 600 trucks to cross into Gaza per day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hamas said on Monday it would next release hostages held in Gaza on Saturday, after an official with the Palestinian militant group had said they would be released a day later than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas is set to release more than 90 hostages over the coming weeks as part of the ceasefire deal. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump vowed a new "golden age" as he took the oath for a historic second US presidential term on Monday, painting a picture of an America in decline that only his hardline policies can restore to glory.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an address in the US Capitol, the 47th president promised a blitz of orders including the declaration of a national emergency on the Mexican border and a policy of only recognizing two genders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also struck a nationalistic tone as he capped the most extraordinary comeback in US political history, pledging to impose trade tariffs, rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, and take "back" the Panama Canal, which has been controlled by the Central American country since 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The golden age of America begins right now. From this day forward our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world," Trump said in the Capitol, where the inauguration was held indoors for the first time in decades, due to freezing weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican even appeared to suggest he was on a divine mission, saying "I was saved by God to make America great again" after escaping an assassin's bullet at an election rally in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  While promising renewal, Trump denounced what he said had been a "betrayal" of Americans by a "radical and corrupt establishment" under outgoing President Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "America's decline is over," said Trump, who at 78 is now the oldest president ever to take office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden, 82, who had earlier hosted Trump and his wife Melania at the White House for tea, watched on as his political rival read the last rites over his single term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden's last acts in office included preemptive pardons of former officials and his own siblings to shield them from Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Trump and said on Monday he was open to talks on the Ukraine conflict. (AFP)

    Donald Trump sworn in as 47th US president

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump was sworn in for a historic second term as US president on Monday, pledging a blitz of immediate orders on immigration and the US culture wars as he caps his extraordinary comeback.
 <br>
  <br>
  With one hand raised in the air, the 47th US president solemnly took the oath of office beneath the huge Rotunda of the US Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump and outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden had earlier travelled by motorcade together to the Capitol, where the ceremony was being held indoors - and with a much smaller crowd - for the first time in decades due to frigid weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, they and their spouses met for a traditional tea at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Welcome home," Biden said to Trump as he and First Lady Jill Biden greeted their successors at the front door to the presidential residence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, was a political outsider at his first inauguration in 2017 as the 45th president, but this time around he is surrounded by America's wealthy and powerful.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man, Elon Musk, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and Google CEO Sundar Pichai all had prime seats in the Capitol alongside Trump's family and cabinet members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, who bankrolled Trump's election campaign to the tune of a quarter of a billion dollars and promotes far-right policies on the X social network, will lead a cost-cutting drive in the new administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump refused to attend Biden's 2021 inauguration after falsely claiming electoral fraud by the Democrat, this time Biden has been keen to restore the sense of tradition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden joined former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton at the Capitol. Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush were there but ex-first lady Michelle Obama pointedly stayed away. (AFP)

    Rapist and murderer of Indian doctor jailed for life

<img alt="Police stand guard at an entrance of Civil and Criminal Court during the verdict for the case of the rape and murder of an Indian doctor in Kolkata. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788348_1_20250120180810.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The rapist and murderer of an Indian doctor was sentenced to life in prison on Monday, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and widespread hospital strikes last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her weeping family had called for the convicted killer to be hanged and said they were "shocked" at the sentence, for a case that highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Judge Anirban Das said the case did not deserve the death penalty as it was not "the rarest of the rare cases", and ordered that Sanjoy Roy must spend his life behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata in August 2024 sparked outrage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy, 33, the lone accused in the case, was arrested a day after the victim's body was discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  The murder led to demands by doctors at government hospitals for additional security, with thousands of citizens in Kolkata and elsewhere in India joining doctors' protests in solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court last year ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the brutality of the killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of Roy, who pleaded not guilty and repeatedly insisted on his innocence was fast-tracked through India's normally glacial legal system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victim's mother, who was seated close to Roy when he was convicted on Saturday, has said the family wanted him to be hanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are shocked by the verdict", the victim's father told AFP, tears running down his face.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue our fight, and won't let investigations stop... Come what may, we will fight for justice." (AFP)

    SKorea central bank cuts forecasts due to Yoon crisis

<img alt="South Korea's central bank cuts its 2025 growth forecast due to the country's ongoing political crisis. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788281_1_20250120120734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's central bank on Monday said it had slashed its 2025 growth forecast because of the political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule on December 3, sending soldiers to parliament but lawmakers voted the measure down and later impeached the president, who is now being held for a criminal probe on insurrection charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He initially resisted arrest and has refused to cooperate with investigators and, when his detention was extended, his die-hard supporters attacked a court building on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unexpected declaration of martial law in early December, coupled with the ongoing political turmoil and the Jeju Air passenger plane disaster, significantly dampened economic sentiment," the Bank of Korea said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 crashed on December 29 in southwestern Muan airport, killing 179 people in the worst ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The political turmoil and crash "led to contractions in domestic consumption and construction investment, likely causing the fourth-quarter growth rate to fall well below the November projection", the bank said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumption, which had shown improvement in the third quarter, appeared to weaken again in the fourth quarter," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, the bank's Monetary Policy Committee revised down its estimate for the last quarter of 2024, from 2.2 percent to a range of 2.0-2.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had projected 1.9 percent growth for 2025, but "the forecast has been revised downward to 1.6-1.7 percent", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This adjustment is primarily attributed to the impact of political uncertainty triggered by the declaration of martial law last December, which has dampened economic sentiment," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is estimated to reduce this year's growth rate by approximately 0.2 percentage points, particularly affecting domestic consumption and other areas of domestic demand," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is the first sitting South Korean president ever to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Yoon behind bars, prosecutors are due to formalise a criminal indictment for insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could be jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon refused to attend questioning on Monday, his lawyers said, with the Corruption Investigation Office -- the body in charge of the probe -- saying it was looking at whether to compel him to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has also been absent from the parallel probe at the Constitutional Court, which is considering whether to uphold his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If that court rules against him, Yoon will formally lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Han Zheng on Sunday told American Vice President-elect JD Vance that there is a lot of room for China-US cooperation, in a meeting ahead of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han told Vance that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to "implement the important consensus reached between President Xi Jinping and US president-elect Donald Trump", Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, who is in the US for the inauguration ceremony, also told Vance that the nation is ready to promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, Han also said both sides could make contributions to world peace and development, as long as they adhere to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Economic and trade relations are important issues of common concern to both sides. While there are differences and friction between China and the US, there are many common interests, and the space for cooperation between the two nations is huge. The two sides should strengthen dialogue and negotiations on this front," Han was quoted by Xinhua as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting came a day before Trump and Vance will be sworn in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also reported that Han met Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who became a key Trump ally during his campaign, and other representatives of the business community in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his meeting with Musk, Han said Beijing welcomes US companies, including Tesla, "to seize the opportunity and share the fruits of China's development" while making greater contributions in promoting China-US economic and trade relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, according to Xinhua, told Han that his company is ready to increase its investments in and cooperation with China and play a role in promoting bilateral economic and trade exchanges.

    Trump vows to end 'American decline'

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a rally the day before his inauguration as Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk gestures. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788274_1_20250120110649.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump pledged a blitz of presidential actions to end "American decline," telling a fired-up inauguration eve rally on Sunday he would crack down on woke ideology and immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a raucous campaign-style gathering in Washington, the 78-year-old Republican promised cheering supporters that he would act with "historic speed" from day one of his White House comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand new day of American strength and prosperity," Trump told a packed sports arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will act with historic speed and strength and fix every single crisis facing our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was joined on stage by Elon Musk -- the tech tycoon who will lead a major cost-cutting drive in his administration -- and who vowed to make America strong "for centuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Then at the end the rally Trump danced alongside the disco band Village People as they performed their 1970s hit "YMCA" which became the unofficial anthem of his election campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Trump's hour-long speech focused on immigration, driving home one of the dark messages that helped spur his remarkable victory in November's presidential election over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to stop the invasion of our borders," added Trump, who has pledged to launch raids targeting undocumented migrants within days of taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Trump effect" has already been on display, with TikTok crediting his "clarity" for being able to restore service in the United States after briefly going dark due to a ban on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to save TikTok," Trump told the rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also promised "lots" of executive orders from his first day back in the Oval Office, including one to ban "transgender insanity" and critical race theory from schools and to keep trans athletes out of women's sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also reiterated a promise to release files on the assassinations of former president John F Kennedy, his brother Bobby Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long lines of Trump supporters formed outside the arena despite snowy conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the future US commander-in-chief paid a highly symbolic visit to Arlington National Cemetery, the resting place of America's war dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, followed by Vice President-elect JD Vance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sombre ceremony contrasted with Trump's last trip to the cemetery as a presidential candidate in August, when the US army criticised his staff for pushing a cemetery employee.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump's hopes for a huge crowd to see his inauguration at the US Capitol on Monday took a blow, however, when forecasts of below freezing weather prompted organisers to move the ceremony indoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of being sworn in on the steps of the Capitol, Trump will now take the oath under the massive dome of its Rotunda, last used for the ceremony 40 years ago during the inauguration of Ronald Reagan. (AFP)

    Freed Israeli hostages reunited with mothers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinians burst into streets to celebrate and began returning to the rubble of bombed-out homes on Sunday after a ceasefire deal halted fighting in Gaza, while three female hostages freed by Hamas were reunited with their mothers inside Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters drove through the southern city of Khan Younis with crowds cheering and chanting. In the north of the territory, bombed into oblivion in the war's most intense fighting, people picked their way on narrow roads through a devastated landscape of rubble and twisted metal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like at last I found some water to drink after being lost in the desert for 15 months," said Aya, a displaced woman from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for over a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tel Aviv, hundreds of Israelis in a square outside the defence headquarters watched a live broadcast from Gaza showing the hostage release on a giant screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd cheered, embraced and wept as three female hostages could be seen getting into a Red Cross vehicle surrounded by armed Hamas fighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after, the Israeli military said Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari had been reunited with their mothers at a meeting point inside Israel, close to the kibbutz and nearby music festival where they had been abducted in the October 7, 2023 Hamas raid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three appeared in good health in a video later released by the military. Damari, who lost two fingers when she was shot the day she was abducted, could be seen smiling and embracing her mother as she held up a bandaged hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like you to tell them: Romi, Doron and Emily – an entire nation embraces you. Welcome home," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a commander by phone as the hostages were driven across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, buses awaited the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli detention. Hamas said the first group to be freed in exchange for the hostages includes 69 women and 21 teenage boys.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the truce in the 15-month-old war between Israel and Hamas took effect following a three-hour delay during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  That last-minute Israeli blitz killed 13 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israel blamed Hamas for being late to deliver the names of hostages it would free, and said it had struck terrorists. Hamas said the holdup in providing the list was technical.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today the guns in Gaza have gone silent," US President Joe Biden said on his last full day in office, welcoming a truce that had eluded US diplomacy for more than a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a long road," Biden said. "But we've reached this point today because of the pressure Israel built on Hamas, backed by the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce calls for fighting to stop, aid to be sent in to Gaza and 33 of nearly 100 Israeli and foreign hostages to go free over the six-week first phase in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. (Reuters)

<img alt='TikTok said on Sunday that it is "in the process of restoring service" in the United States. Image: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788237_1_20250120034419.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok said on Sunday it was restoring its service after US President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the United States when he returns to power on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As a result of president Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the US," the platform said in a message to users.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok also issued an earlier statement after US users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website, while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive."
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok stopped working for US users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like the United States to have a 50 percent ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of Palestinians burst into the streets across Gaza as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on Sunday, some in celebration, others to visit the graves of relatives, while many rushed back to see what remained of their homes.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like at last I found some water to drink after getting lost in the desert for 15 months. I feel alive again," Aya, a displaced woman from Gaza City, who has been sheltering in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for over a year, told Reuters via a chat app.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the north of the territory, where some of the most intense Israeli airstrikes and battles with the militants took place, hundreds of people picked their way through a devastated landscape of rubble and twisted metal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armed Hamas fighters drove through the southern city of Khan Younis, with crowds cheering and chanting, despite an almost three-hour delay in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, which follows 15 months of devastating conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas policemen, dressed in blue police uniform, deployed in some areas after months of trying to keep out of sight to avoid Israeli airstrikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who had gathered to cheer the fighters chanted "Greetings to Al-Qassam Brigades" - the armed wing of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the resistance factions are staying in spite of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu," one fighter told Reuters, referring to the armed wing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a ceasefire, a full and comprehensive one God willing, and there will be no return to war in spite of him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire deal took effect after a nearly three-hour delay, pausing a war that has brought seismic political change to the Middle East and giving hope to Gaza's 2.3 million people, many of whom have been displaced several times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said Israeli military strikes killed at least 13 people in attacks across the enclave during the delay. No more attacks were reported after it took effect at 11.15 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now waiting for the day when we head back to our home in Gaza City," Aya said. "Damaged or not, it doesn't matter, the nightmare of death and starvation is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  The streets in the shattered Gaza City in the north of the territory were already busy with groups of people waving the Palestinian flag and filming the scenes on their mobile phones. Several carts loaded with household possessions travelled down a thoroughfare scattered with rubble and debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Ayham, 40, sheltering with his family in Khan Younis, said the scene of destruction in his home city was "dreadful", adding that while the ceasefire may have spared lives it was no time for celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are in pain, deep pain and it is time that we hug one another and cry," Abu Ayham said via the same app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The highly anticipated ceasefire deal could help usher in an end to the Gaza war, which began after Hamas, which controls the tiny coastal territory, attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's response has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed nearly 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza-based health officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long lines of trucks carrying fuel and aid supplies queued up at border crossings in the hours before the ceasefire was due to take effect. The World Food Programme said they began to cross on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal requires 600 truckloads of aid to be allowed into Gaza every day of the initial six-week ceasefire, including 50 carrying fuel. Half of the 600 aid trucks would be delivered to Gaza's north, where experts have warned famine is imminent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The war ended, but life isn't going to be better because of the destruction and the losses we suffered," Aya said. "But at least there will be no more bloodshed of women and children, I hope." (Reuters)

    Israel says truce with Hamas begins, after delay

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Sunday said a truce with Hamas began in Gaza at 5.15pm Hong Kong time, nearly three hours after initially scheduled, following a last-minute delay on the orders of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu had said the ceasefire could not take effect until Hamas gave the names of the hostages up for release on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least eight Palestinians died from Israeli attacks that occurred between the period when the ceasefire was meant to begin until it actually took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, which ultimately published the names of three Israeli women to be released, attributed the delay in producing the names to "technical reasons", as well as the "complexities of the field situation and the continued bombing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel then confirmed it had received the list, adding that four other living female hostages would be freed in seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, thousands of displaced Gazans carrying tents, clothes and personal belongings began heading to their homes after the ceasefire took effect following more than 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinians were seen travelling by truck, donkey cart and on foot back to their homes through devastated swathes of Gaza, particularly in the northern parts of the Palestinian territory. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A long-awaited ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war was delayed on Sunday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the last minute that it would not take effect until the Palestinian militant group provided a list of the hostages to be released.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, while "affirming its commitment" to the terms of the ceasefire, said: "The delay in providing the names of those to be released in the first batch is due to technical reasons."
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from Netanyahu's office, issued less than an hour before the truce was to start, said he had "instructed the IDF (military) that the ceasefire... will not begin until Israel has received the list".
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial exchange was to see three Israeli hostages released from captivity in return for a first group of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the ceasefire goes ahead, a total of 33 hostages taken by militants during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel will be returned from Gaza during an initial 42-day truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the deal, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is intended to pave the way for an end to more than 15 months of war sparked by the October 7 attack, the deadliest in Israeli history.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a deal struck by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of negotiations, and takes effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had US support to return to war if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling the 42-day first phase a "temporary ceasefire", he said: "If we are forced to resume the war, we will do so with force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting continued right up to the eve of the truce, with Gaza's civil defence agency saying that at least five members of one family were killed when an Israeli strike hit their tent in the southern city of Khan Yunis. (AFP)

<img alt="Under a law passed last year, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788182_1_20250119110315.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 11.45am Hong Kong time on Sunday: "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to US national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court extended the detention of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Sunday over concerns he could destroy evidence linked to his martial law declaration, enraging his supporters who attacked the court building.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of pro-Yoon protesters smashed windows and broke down doors to enter the court after the decision was announced, chanting the name of the president, who plunged South Korea into its worst political chaos in decades with his bid to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's December 3 martial law declaration lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them. He was impeached soon after and suspended from duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was detained in a dawn raid on Wednesday on insurrection charges after he refused investigators' summons and went to ground in his residence, using his presidential security detail to resist arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon had also refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The disgraced leader, who attended court for the first time on Saturday over his case, will now remain in custody, with the new warrant allowing investigators to keep him for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer Seok Dong-hyeon slammed the court decision, but also warned the president's supporters not to escalate the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is likely not what President Yoon desires," he said in a statement, adding violence could also "create burdens" for the president's future trials. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A ceasefire in the Gaza war begins on Sunday morning, mediator Qatar said, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to bring back "all the hostages" held in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The truce is intended to end more than 15 months of fighting and devastating bombardment, but in a televised address on Saturday evening, the hawkish premier stressed Israel had US support to return to war if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an initial 42-day ceasefire, Palestinian militant groups will hand over 33 hostages, three of them on Sunday, and Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, some of whom will be deported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since mediators Qatar and the United States, which brokered the deal along with Egypt, announced the details on Wednesday, Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Gaza's civil defence rescue agency said at least five members of one family were killed when a strike hit their tent in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions were heard over Jerusalem as Yemen's Huthi rebels launched a barrage of missiles at Israel in a show of support for the Palestinians ahead of the truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Huthis said they targeted the defence ministry in Tel Aviv and also fired two missiles at the Red Sea port city of Eilat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani told Sky News the framework signed this week was the same as one agreed in December 2023, adding it amounted to 13 months of "waste".
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is to take effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration for a second term as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told US network NBC on Saturday that he had told Netanyahu that the war "has to end". "We want it to end, but to keep doing what has to be done," he said. (AFP)

<img alt="Saif Ali Khan is one of Bollywood's most bankable and well-known actors. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788150_1_20250118221657.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh on Saturday detained a second person suspected of involvement in a knife attack in which Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was wounded.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan, 54, was stabbed six times by an intruder during a burglary attempt at his home in Mumbai early on Thursday. He had surgery after sustaining stab wounds to his spine, neck and hands, and is out of danger, doctors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got information from Mumbai Police that a suspect is travelling by Jnaneswari Express train," Sanjeev Sinha, a representative of the Railway Protection Force, told the ANI news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "...Mumbai Police officials were contacted through video call and the suspect's identity was confirmed. He has been detained," Sinha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in India's financial capital of Mumbai had on Friday detained another key suspect in the knife attack.

 Two judges were killed in a shooting attack on Saturday at the Supreme Court building in Tehran, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Three judges of the Supreme Court were targeted. Two of them were martyred," the Judiciary's Mizan Online website reported, adding that the "assailant killed himself."
  <br>
  <br>
  State news agency IRNA also reported that one other person was injured in the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizan identified the two slain judges as Ali Razini and Mohammad Moghisseh, adding that they worked on cases "fighting crimes against national security, espionage and terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  The motive behind their killing was not immediately clear, but Mizan said the assailant was not involved in any cases before the Supreme Court, without providing further details on the attacker's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said an investigation into the incident was launched, Mizan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran judge Moghisseh, 68, was sanctioned in 2019 by the United States for having "overseen countless unfair trails, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded," according to the US Department of the Treasury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Razini, 71, held several important positions in Iran's judiciary and was previously targeted in a 1998 assassination attempt by assailants "who planted a magnetic bomb on his vehicle," according to Mizan.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August 2005, renowned Iranian judge Hassan Moghaddas was murdered by two gunmen who climbed into his car in the middle of a busy business district in Tehran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two men convicted over his killing were publicly executed by hanging two years later. (AFP)

    Indian court finds man guilty in hospital rape case

<img alt="A crowd of protesters are demanding he be given the death penalty. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788134_1_20250118181325.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian court on Saturday found a 33-year-old man guilty of the rape and murder of a doctor, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and hospital strikes last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the victim's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata last August once again highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  It led to demands by doctors at government hospitals for additional security, with thousands of citizens in Kolkata and elsewhere in India joining the doctors' protests in solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of defendant Sanjoy Roy was fast-tracked through India's normally glacial legal system and arguments in the case concluded a little over a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sentence will be delivered on Monday," presiding judge Anirban Das said after finding Roy, a civic volunteer in the hospital, guilty of rape and murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy has consistently maintained his innocence and again told the court that he was not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have been framed," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy was brought to court by a prison van and greeted by a crowd of protesters, held at bay by police officers, demanding he be given the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hang him, hang him," they chanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentiment was echoed by the victim's family, none of whom have been identified in keeping with Indian law around the reporting of sexual violence cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The common man will lose faith in the judiciary if he is not handed down the death penalty," said the victim's mother, seated just a few metres from Roy when the verdict was read out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her father added: "He brutally snuffed out the life of our daughter. He deserves the same fate."
  <br>
  <br>
  The trainee doctor was found raped and murdered in a seminar room of the hospital last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crime led to nationwide outrage and prolonged protests by doctors across the state, demanding justice for the victim and stronger security measures in government hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy was arrested a day after the victim's body was discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court set up a national task force after the protests that suggested ways to enhance safety measures in government hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gruesome nature of the attack drew comparisons with the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, which also sparked weeks of nationwide protests. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was in court for the first time on Saturday for a crucial hearing that will decide whether to extend his detention as investigators probe his failed martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's supporters rallied outside the court and scuffled with police as he arrived in a blue van, weeks after throwing the nation into chaos by attempting to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's December 3 martial law bid lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was subsequently impeached by parliament and resisted arrest for weeks, holed up in his guarded residence until he was finally detained on Wednesday in a dawn raid.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the disgraced president remains in custody after investigators requested a new warrant on Friday to extend his detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  He decided to appear in court "with the intention of restoring his honour," the president's lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said before the hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Seoul Western District Court later confirmed that the hearing commenced with the president in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  After reviewing the request to extend Yoon's detention, a judge is expected to announce her decision on Saturday night or early on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the court, crowds of Yoon's backers waving flags and holding "release the president" placards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police officers formed a chain to prevent them reaching the court entrance, which has been closed to the public since Friday evening over safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  If approved, as expected, the new warrant would likely extend Yoon's detention by 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would give prosecutors time to formalise an indictment for insurrection, a charge that could see him jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  If indicted, the president would probably be detained for the duration of the trial. (AFP)

    Israeli government approves Gaza ceasefire deal

<img alt="For these starving Palestinians the truce cannot come fast enough. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788118_1_20250118141650.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's cabinet voted to approve a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal on Saturday, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ending days of uncertainty about whether the truce would go into effect this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip will take effect at 0630 GMT on Sunday morning, Qatar, which helped mediate the deal, said on Saturday, and would halt the fighting and bombardment in Gaza's deadliest-ever war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would also enable the release of hostages held in the territory since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has approved the hostage return plan," Netanyahu's office said early on Saturday morning after the cabinet held its vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's justice ministry has said 737 prisoners and detainees will be freed as part of the first phase of the deal – none before 4:00 pm local time (1400 GMT) on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli strikes have killed dozens since the ceasefire deal was announced, with the military saying on Thursday it had hit about 50 targets across Gaza over the previous 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is to take effect on the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump, who claimed credit for working with outgoing US President Joe Biden's team to seal the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was earlier approved by Israel's security cabinet, with Netanyahu's office saying it "supports achieving the objectives of the war."
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinian Authority has completed preparations "to assume full responsibility in Gaza" after the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even before the truce begins, displaced Gazans were preparing to return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will go to kiss my land," said Nasr al-Gharabli, who fled his home in Gaza City for a camp further south. "If I die on my land, it would be better than being here as a displaced person."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, there was joy but also anguish over the remaining hostages taken in the Hamas attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kfir Bibas, whose second birthday falls on Saturday, is the youngest hostage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas said in November 2023 that Kfir, his four-year-old brother Ariel and their mother Shiri had died in an air strike, but with the Israeli military yet to confirm their deaths, many are clinging to hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think of them, these two little redheads, and I get shivers," said 70-year-old Osnat Nyska, whose grandchildren attended nursery with the Bibas brothers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two far-right ministers had voiced opposition to the deal, with one threatening to quit the cabinet, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said before the vote he believed the ceasefire would proceed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident, and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said Israel pounded several areas of the territory, killing more than 100 people and wounding hundreds more since the deal was announced on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, warned that Israeli strikes were risking the lives of hostages and could turn their "freedom... into a tragedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 7, 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 people taken hostage, 94 are still in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,876 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the UN considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire agreement followed intensified efforts by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of fruitless negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the days of talks, Biden pointman Brett McGurk was joined in the region by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff in an unusual pairing to get the deal over the line, US officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we weren't involved... the deal would've never happened," Trump said in an interview on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, announcing the agreement on Wednesday, said an initial 42-day ceasefire would see 33 hostages released.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, he said: "We seek a full implementation of the first phase, and for the second phase to be the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are waiting for the Security Council to issue a binding resolution to implement the agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli authorities assume the 33 are alive, but Hamas has yet to confirm that.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also in the first phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza's densely populated areas and allow displaced Palestinians to return "to their residences," the Qatari prime minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two sources close to Hamas said three Israeli women soldiers would be the first to be released on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women may, in fact, be civilians, as the militant group refers to all Israelis of military age who have undergone mandatory military service as soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli military official said reception points had been established at Kerem Shalom, Erez and Reim, where hostages would be joined by doctors and mental health specialists before being "transported via helicopter or vehicle" to hospitals in Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel "is then expected to release the first group of Palestinian prisoners, including several with high sentences," a source said on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During talks on Friday, negotiators agreed to form a joint operations room in Cairo to "ensure effective coordination" and compliance with the truce terms, Egyptian state-linked media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron said French-Israeli citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi were among the hostages due to be freed in the first phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden said the second phase could bring a "permanent end to the war."
  <br>
  <br>
  In aid-starved Gaza, where nearly all of its 2.4 million people have been displaced at least once, humanitarian workers worry about the monumental task ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything has been destroyed, children are on the streets, you can't pinpoint just one priority," said Doctors Without Borders coordinator Amande Bazerolle. (AFP)
