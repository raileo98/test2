  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pope Francis urged the world's 1.4 billion Catholics to abandon the "mad pursuit" of money and instead devote themselves to their faith in a new encyclical letter, the highest form of papal teaching, released on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Francis' fourth encyclical over his 11-year papacy largely abstains from talking about political issues, a departure from his earlier writings, which also addressed themes such as global climate change and "trickle-down" economic policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Dilexit nos" (He loved us) instead encourages believers to strengthen their religious lives. The world is living in an "age of superficiality," the pope says, and Catholics and other Christians "need to rediscover the importance of the heart".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In a world where everything is bought and sold, people's sense of their worth appears increasingly to depend on what they can accumulate with the power of money," Francis writes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The love of Christ has no place in this perverse mechanism, yet only that love can set us free from a mad pursuit that no longer has room for a gratuitous love," says the pontiff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 142-page text focuses on spiritual themes, rather than calls for concrete political action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pope's 2015 letter "Laudato Si'" (Praise Be) urged the world to care for the environment and has been credited by some world leaders with influencing discussions ahead of the 2016 Paris Agreement. His 2020 letter "Fratelli Tutti" (Brothers All) called for a reconsideration of economic policies in the aftermath of the global coronavirus pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new letter instead offers reflections on a Catholic spiritual practice promoted by a 17th century French nun. Sr. Margaret Mary Alacoque, who reportedly experienced several visions of Jesus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Christians should emulate Jesus' love by also caring for those in need, the pope says. "There is no greater way for us to return love for love," he states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Release of the papal document comes as Francis is leading a month-long summit of global Catholic leaders at the Vatican, which is expected to release its own text on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Discussions around most of the divisive issues originally part of the summit's considerations, such as the possibility of letting women be ordained as Catholic clergy, have now been put on hold. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   At least 1.1 million people on India's eastern coast hunkered down in storm shelters ahead of a powerful cyclone set to hammer the low-lying region early Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cyclone Dana is likely to hit the coasts of West Bengal and Odisha states -- home to around 150 million people -- as a "severe cyclonic storm", India's weather bureau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It predicts winds gusting up to 120 kilometres per hour to cause "major damage" to thatch-roofed houses, which are common on the coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Downpours began lashing areas of neighbouring West Bengal state, prompting officials there to be on high alert, while Odisha already saw strong winds and rain on Thursday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have closed schools, cancelled more than 200 trains, suspended flights and warned fishermen not to venture out to sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India's navy said two ships were "standing by with supplies and rescue and diving teams".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The eye of the storm is predicted to make landfall early Friday, near the coal-exporting port of Dhamra.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Government disaster response teams drove the streets, broadcasting warnings from loudspeakers urging people to take shelter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Crashing waves are expected to inundate swathes of coastal areas, with water predicted to surge up to two metres above usual tide levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India’s eastern coasts have long been prone to cyclones, but the number of intense storms is increasing along the country’s coast, with global warming driven by planet-heating gases causing them to become more extreme and unpredictable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year was India’s deadliest cyclone season in recent years, killing 523 people and costing an estimated US$2.5 billion in damage. (AP/AFP)

    Jailed British nurse Lucy Letby loses appeal

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former British nurse and convicted child serial killer Lucy Letby on Thursday lost an attempt to appeal against her conviction for trying to murder a newborn baby, amid questions over the fairness of her trials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby, 34, was found guilty of murdering seven children and attempting to murder seven more between June 2015 and June 2016 while working in the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital in Chester, northern England, making her Britain's worst serial child killer of modern times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was convicted of an eighth count of attempted murder at a retrial earlier this year, after the original jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge that Letby tried to kill a baby girl by removing her breathing tube.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prosecutor Nick Johnson told Manchester Crown Court that, little more than an hour after the child was born, a senior doctor found the baby's breathing tube dislodged and Letby standing there "doing nothing".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby's lawyer Benjamin Myers told London's Court of Appeal on Thursday that Letby "maintains and has maintained she is not guilty of the offences".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He argued that the retrial was an abuse of process as Letby could not have a fair trial because of extensive coverage of her convictions, which featured "intense hostility towards her" and comments made by the Crown Prosecution Service and police.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There was no way in which the jury in trial two were going to have the publicity and the comment and the hostility ameliorated," Myers said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge William Davis refused Letby's application for leave to appeal against the conviction from her retrial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby attended the hearing by videolink from prison and sat impassively as the judge stated the court's reasons for refusing her application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The outcome of the first trial undoubtedly led to an unusually large amount of publicity and online debate," Davis said. "That is because, on its face, the case was extraordinary."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby's attempt to overturn her convictions from the first trial was refused in May. She can now only challenge those convictions if the Criminal Cases Review Commission refer those cases back to the Court of Appeal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since her trials, Letby's conviction has come under a spotlight, following criticism by some experts of medical and statistical evidence presented by the prosecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some media have questioned whether she might be the victim of a miscarriage of justice, while a public inquiry into her crimes continues.  (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping on Thursday told the Brics summit in the Russian city of Kazan that world peace and development are still facing formidable challenges and urged the group to be a "stabiliser" to ensure global security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Addressing other leaders of Brics nations on the final day of the summit, Xi noted that China is doing what it can to prevent the conflict in the Middle East from spreading.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will continue to advance the ceasefire efforts in Gaza and to start new initiatives to make sure that the war will not extend to Lebanon," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also said that the "common march of the Global South towards modernity is a major event in world history".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to show collective wisdom and strength to make our contribution and show the responsibilities to build a community of shared future for mankind. We have to uphold peace and achieve common security," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be the stabiliser to ensure security and also to continue our efforts to solve problems to ensure global security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brics grew out of meetings between China, Russia, and India, who then began to meet more formally, eventually adding Brazil, then South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. (Additional reporting by AFP, Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tropical Storm Trami has killed at least 26 people and forced more than 150,000 to flee their homes in the Philippines, officials said on Thursday, as it made landfall on the northeastern coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, locally known as severe tropical storm Kristine, dumped heavy to torrential rain on the main island of Luzon, triggering widespread flooding and landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With maximum sustained winds of 95 kph (59 mph), the storm was moving westward across the mountainous northern region of Cordillera towards the South China Sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters warned of heavy to intense rainfall, flooding, landslides and storm surges for some northern provinces.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the deaths from the storm over the past few days were due to drowning and landslides in the central Bicol region, including Naga city where 14 were reported dead on Thursday, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami made landfall in the northeastern town of Divilacan in Isabela province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government ordered businesses and schools in the path of the storm to close in anticipation of heavy rain and floods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 163,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centres, the civil defence office said, most of whom were in Bicol as residents fled their homes after floodwaters reached as high as the roofs of bungalow houses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, a powerful cyclone is expected to barrel into India's eastern coast early on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dana is expected to cross the coasts of the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal between midnight Thursday and Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The states expect to evacuate around 300,000 people each, and Odisha has already moved 50,000 people to relief shelters. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korea "won't sit idle" over the North's deployment of thousands of troops to help Russia fight Ukraine, President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Thursday, slamming it as a "provocation".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency has claimed that about 3,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia training, likely to deploy to the frontlines against Ukraine soon, with thousands more troops to be sent by December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato and Washington have confirmed that Pyongyang's soldiers are now training in Russia, warning that if they were to join the fight against Kyiv, it could mark a dangerous escalation of the grinding war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "South Korea won't sit idle over this," Yoon said after talks with visiting Polish President Andrzej Duda, adding that the two countries agreed North Korea's deployment was "a provocation that threatens global security beyond the Korean Peninsula and Europe".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Poland's Duda spoke to Yoon on Thursday, after which the two leaders "strongly condemned North Korea's nuclear and missile development and provocations“.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korea has previously denied deploying forces to Russia, while Moscow has not confirmed it, but has defended its military cooperation with Pyongyang. (AFP)

  <img alt="The strike has halted activity at two Seattle-area factories that assemble the Boeing 737 MAX and 777. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776000_1_20241024133808.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Boeing workers in the Seattle region decisively rejected the US aerospace giant's latest contract offer on Wednesday, extending their nearly six-week strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Almost two-thirds – 64 percent – of the members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 rejected the contract, the union said on social media platform X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest Boeing offer had included a 35 percent wage hike, but did not reinstate a pension plan sought by many employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 33,000 hourly workers with the IAM have been on the picket line since September 13, when workers overwhelmingly rejected a Boeing proposal for a new four-year contract to replace the expiring pact.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike has halted activity at two Seattle-area factories that assemble the 737 MAX and 777.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Workers had sought a 40 percent wage increase to make up for years of tepid salary growth that have not kept pace with inflation and that employees complain leave them unable to afford living in one of the most costly regions of the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After 10 years of sacrifices, we still have ground to make up, and we're hopeful to do so by resuming negotiations promptly," Jon Holden, president of the Seattle union, said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is workplace democracy – and also clear evidence that there are consequences when a company mistreats its workers year after year," Holden said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ten years of holding workers back unfortunately cannot be undone quickly or easily, but we will continue to negotiate in good faith until we have made gains that workers feel adequately make up for what the company took from them in the past," he added.

   <br/>
   A Boeing spokeswoman said Wednesday night the company had no comment on the vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extension of the strike adds to the troubles facing Boeing and its new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who earlier Wednesday expressed measured optimism the latest contract would be ratified. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping has urged China and India to strengthen communication and cooperation during talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Kazan, Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first bilateral meeting in five years between the two leaders on Wednesday came days after the countries reached a deal on their contested border.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi said the two sides should resolve conflicts and differences and realise each other's development dreams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   State media also quoted the president as saying China and India should "shoulder international responsibilities, set an example for developing countries to seek strength through unity, and contribute to a multi-polar world and democratisation of international relations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Modi, for his part, said mutual trust will guide ties with China, welcoming the consensus over the border issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "India-China relations are important for the people of our countries, and for regional and global peace and stability," Modi said on X. "Mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity will guide bilateral relations."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi and Modi last held formal bilateral talks in October 2019 in the southern Indian town of Mamallapuram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The president also met other leaders on the sidelines of the Brics summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his meeting with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, Xi said an early ceasefire and ending the war in Gaza are key to easing regional tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And in talks with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Xi said Beijing stands ready to work with Cairo to push for an early end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and ease tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also welcomed Egypt's participation in the Brics summit for the first time as a full member.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World leaders called for peace in the Middle East and Ukraine at the summit meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin said he welcomed offers to mediate in the Ukraine conflict.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin also said the summit's agenda covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, as well as settling regional conflicts and moving to expand the Bric group of countries. (Agencies)

    Turkey strikes Kurdish militants after deadly attack

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Turkey said it launched strikes on Kurdish militants in Iraq and Syria on Wednesday after blaming them for an attack that killed five people at a defence firm near Ankara.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A further 22 people were wounded in the attack, which the government said was "very likely" carried out by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hours later, "an air operation was carried out against terrorist targets in the north of Iraq and Syria," the defence ministry said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A total of 32 targets belonging to the terrorists were successfully destroyed," it said, adding that operations were continuing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Listed as a terror group by Turkey and its Western allies, the PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. It has a number of bases in Kurdish regions of Iraq and Syria.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the attack that sparked the strikes, a huge explosion rocked the headquarters of state-run Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) some 40 kilometres north of Ankara shortly after 3:30 pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It sent clouds of smoke into the air as the sound of gunfire rang out, Turkish media reported, with the incident quickly denounced by Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya as a "terror attack."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was in Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin, called it a "heinous" attack on Turkey's defence industry "targeting the survival of our country," in a message on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yerlikaya said three of the injured were in critical condition and that the two attackers, "a woman and a man," had been "neutralised."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no immediate claim for the attack but Yerlikaya said: "The way in which this action was carried out is very probably linked to the PKK."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said efforts to identify the perpetrators of the attack were ongoing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Defence Minister Yasar Guler also pointed the finger at "PKK villains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As they always do, they tried to disturb our nation's peace through a despicable and dishonourable attack... we will make them suffer for what they have done," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkey's vice president Cevdet Yilmaz said four of the victims were TAI employees while the fifth was a taxi driver. Media reports earlier said the assailants had killed him and taken his taxi to carry out the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An unconfirmed report by private channel NTV said a "group of terrorists" had burst into the building, one of whom "blew himself up" while other outlets reported exchanges of fire for more than an hour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haberturk TV said there was a "hostage situation," with another media pundit saying "a number of hostages" had been rescued.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkish authorities imposed a blackout of live images from the scene.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabah newspaper published what it said was a CCTV image from the entrance showing a black-clad young man with a moustache carrying a rucksack and what appeared to be an assault rifle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As night fell, dozens of ambulances could be seen waiting in convoy near the site, their blue lights flashing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of Turkey's top defence firms and a major arms producer, TAI employs 15,500 people and has a vast production site covering an area of five million square metres, its website says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack drew condemnation from across Turkey and beyond, with Putin offering Erdogan his "condolences in connection with the terror attack" at the start of their meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Statements of condemnation and condolences to the families of the victims also poured in from Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Tehran and Washington and Nato leadership.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack came as Turkey's political establishment appeared to be leaning towards a political, negotiated solution to the decades-long conflict with the Kurdish militants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The timing was not lost on the main pro-Kurdish party, Dem, the third largest force in parliament, which said it was "noteworthy that the attack took place just as Turkish society was talking about a solution and the possibility of dialogue."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It took place a day after the head of the far-right MHP, which belongs to Erdogan's ruling coalition, invited jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to address parliament to announce his movement's dissolution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984, claiming tens of thousands of lives, with Ocalan held in solitary confinement on a prison island since 1999. (AFP)

    Pelicot trial calls for rape law changes in France

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   France may introduce changes to its rape law to include consent for the first time, after a mass rape trial shook the country, challenging the limits of existing legislation and prompting some leading politicians to call for change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dominique Pelicot has admitted to drugging his wife and recruiting dozens of men online to rape her while she was unconscious and 50 men are facing trial alongside him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They are accused of taking turns on the drugged and inert body of Gisèle Pelicot while her husband recorded the horror for his swelling private video library.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite video evidence against them, at least 35 of the defendants have denied the rape charges, claiming that Dominique Pelicot tricked them into believing they were taking part in a sex game, or that Gisele Pelicot was feigning sleep.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dominique Pelicot denied this, telling the court his co-defendants knew exactly what the situation was.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case has prompted deep soul-searching in France, with consent at the heart of the matter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am determined that things change in this society," Gisele Pelicot told the Avignon court on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gisele Pelicot insisted from the start that the trial should be open to the public, and has encouraged other women who have been sexually assaulted to come forward.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wanted all women who are rape victims to say to themselves 'Mrs Pelicot did it, so we can do it too'," she said. "It's not us who should feel shame, but them (the perpetrators).”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   France’s new Justice Minister Didier Migaud recently said he is in favour of updating the law, as has President Emmanuel Macron, after France blocked the inclusion of a consent-based rape definition in a European directive in 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I believe it is beyond understanding for our fellow citizens to refuse to include consent in the definition of rape," Migaud told lawmakers earlier this month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 2023 survey by one of France's main polling institutes, IFOP, found that nine out of 10 people polled wanted France to support the EU directive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Consent-based rape law already exists in Sweden, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and more than a dozen other European countries, with the rise of the feminist #MeToo movement prompting legislative reform in some jurisdictions since 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, French criminal law defines rape as a penetrative act or oral sex act committed on someone using "violence, coercion, threat or surprise." It makes no clear mention of the need for a partner's consent and prosecutors must prove the intention to rape to secure a guilty verdict, five legal experts said. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping on Wednesday called on member countries to build Brics for peace and act as guardians of common security in an address at their summit in Kazan, Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also spoke about three principles to help defuse the Ukraine crisis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his speech, the president urged Brics countries to advocate peaceful co-existence and harmony between civilizations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said Brics members should support sustainable development, and that China is willing to leverage its advantages to expand cooperation with the bloc in green industries, clean energy and green minerals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Ukraine, Xi urged Brics nations to uphold the three principles of no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party, with an aim towards de-escalating the crisis as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin has welcomed offers by Brics leaders to mediate in the conflict, his spokesman said Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many countries "expressed a desire to contribute more actively" to resolving the conflict, state media cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters on the sidelines of the summit. (Xinhua & agencies)

    Tokyo Metro shares rocket higher on debut

  <img alt="Proceeds from the Tokyo Metro IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775777_1_20241023103553.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tokyo Metro shares soared more than 40 percent on their debut on Wednesday after its government owners raised US$2.3 billion in Japan's biggest initial public offering since 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In early trade Tokyo Metro shares were at 1,745 yen (US$11.5), up 45 percent from their issue price of 1,200 yen, with reports saying the issue was 15 times oversubscribed among investors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Proceeds from the IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan that killed 18,000 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The listing reduces government ownership, split between the country and Tokyo city, to around 50 percent. Many Japanese rail operators are already privatised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To attract investors, perks for buying more than 200 shares included tickets to the Tokyo Metro museum and golf range, as well as free tempura toppings at its noodle stands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The IPO is Japan's largest since tycoon Masayoshi Son's tech and telecoms conglomerate SoftBank Group raised a national record of US$23.5 billion by listing its mobile unit in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   London built the first public underground railway, but in 1927 Tokyo became the first Asian city with a subway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each day around 6.5 million people ride the Metro's nine lines, which are part of a vast transport network serving the capital and its sprawling suburbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four other subway lines are run separately by the Tokyo government, alongside private services and East Japan Railway's overground routes such as the Yamanote Line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The network's cleanliness and efficiency contrasts with the often creaking infrastructure of other big cities like London, Paris and New York, where many operators are deep in debt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tokyo Metro posted a net profit of 46.3 billion yen for the fiscal year that ended in March 2024, up 67 percent from a year earlier. This year it is aiming to increase this to 52.3 billion yen. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a big US push for a ceasefire in Gaza, met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday after Washington called for an end to the war in Lebanon "as soon as possible".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken began his meetings in Israel as Hezbollah launched rockets into Tel Aviv and Haifa, and Israeli air strikes pummelled parts of Beirut's southern suburbs, including an air strike that caused a multi-storey building to entirely collapse and sent a fresh wave of panicked residents fleeing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His meetings with Netanyahu and other top officials also come as Israel weighs its response to Iran's October 1 missile attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Diplomatic efforts have so far failed to bring an end to both the year-long war in the Palestinian territory Gaza and to its spillover conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah said on Tuesday there would be no negotiations while fighting continues, and claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Netanyahu's holiday home on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington hopes the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar – Israel’s most wanted man, blamed for triggering the year of warfare by planning the deadly attacks on October 7 last year on Israel territory – will provide a new opportunity for peace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Israel has so far shown no sign of relenting in its military campaigns even after assassinating several leaders of Iran's allies Hamas and Hezbollah, which lost its powerful secretary-general Sayed Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken's week-long trip to the Middle East will also take him to Jordan and Qatar. US officials say he is focusing on plans for rebuilding and governing Gaza after the war, necessary for reaching a ceasefire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington has long said it ideally wants Gaza reunited with the West Bank under a government run by the Palestinian Authority, which now exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli occupied West Bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken also plans to speak to Israeli leaders about the expected strike on Iran and discourage any move that could massively escalate regional conflict, an official on the plane with him said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Gaza war began after Hamas-led fighters attacked Israeli communities on October 7 last year, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed 42,718 Palestinians, Gaza health authorities say. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping and other world leaders have arrived in the Russian city of Kazan for the Brics summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi was greeted at the airport by Russian officials upon his arrival on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He later met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hailed ties between the two countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, and the international situation is chaotic and intertwined," Xi told Putin, praising the "profound friendship" between Beijing and Moscow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ties have "injected strong impetus into the development, revitalisation and modernisation of the two countries" and have "made important contributions to upholding international equity and justice," Xi said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the two sides "have found the right way for neighbouring major countries to get along with each other which features non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party," according to Xinhua News Agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa are among the leaders joining the Brics gathering in Kazan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is also undertaking his first trip to Russia since April 2022 to attend the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov touted the summit as the largest foreign-policy event ever held by Russia, with 36 countries attending and more than 20 of them represented by heads of state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Putin, the three-day meeting also offers a powerful way to demonstrate the failure of US-led efforts to isolate Moscow over the war in Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Brics alliance, which initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has expanded rapidly to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and a few others have expressed an interest in joining. (Agencies)

  <img alt="North Korean state media have not commented on Pyongyang's purported troop deployment to Russia. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775650_1_20241022150649.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   North Korea has not sent troops to Russia to help Moscow fight Ukraine, one of its United Nations representatives said on Monday, dismissing Seoul's claims as a "groundless rumour".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency had said that Pyongyang sent a "large-scale" troop deployment to help its ally, claiming that 1,500 special forces were already training in Russia's Far East and ready to head soon for the frontlines of the Ukraine war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for the so-called military cooperation with Russia, my delegation does not feel any need for comment on such groundless stereotyped rumours," a North Korean representative said at a committee meeting during the UN General Assembly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's claims were "aimed at smearing the image of the DPRK and undermining the legitimate, friendly and cooperative relations between two sovereign states," the representative told the meeting, held late on Monday in New York.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korean state media have not commented on the purported troop deployment, and Russia has also not confirmed the troop deployment, but defended its military cooperation with the North.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After Seoul summoned Moscow's ambassador in South Korea to complain, the envoy "stressed that cooperation between Russia and North Korea... is not directed against the interests of South Korea's security".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Neither Nato nor the United States have confirmed the deployment, but both have cast it as a potentially dangerous escalation in the long-running Ukraine conflict.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have seen reports the DPRK has sent forces and is preparing to send additional soldiers to Ukraine to fight alongside Russia," Robert Wood, US ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If true, this marks a dangerous and highly concerning development and an obvious deepening of the DPRK-Russia military relationship," Wood said. (AFP)

    Hurricane Oscar leaves six dead in Cuba

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hurricane Oscar left six people dead after hitting Cuba over the weekend during a major power blackout, authorities said on Monday, as electricity was restored to most of the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lights went out for the country's 10 million people on Friday after the collapse of the nation's largest power plant crippled the whole grid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   By Monday afternoon, nearly 90 percent of customers in Havana – home to some two million people – had power again, the capital's electricity company said in a report published by state-run news portal Cubadebate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course I'm happy!" Olga Gomez, a 59-year-old housewife in Havana, said after the lights came back on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have an elderly senile mother of 85 and an autistic son. It's very difficult when there's no power," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many residents outside Havana, however, remained without electricity, according to the authorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba was still bathed in darkness on Sunday when Hurricane Oscar made landfall in the eastern part of the country as a Category 1 storm, causing several deaths and damage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Regrettably, according to preliminary information, six lives have been lost," President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a televised remarks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The storm caused severe damage in the eastern province of Guantanamo, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oscar weakened into a tropical storm as it moved inland but was still expected to bring "significant, life-threatening flash flooding along with mudslides," the US National Hurricane Center warned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Roofs and the walls of houses were damaged, and electricity poles and trees felled, state television reported. (AFP)

  <img alt='US special envoy Amos Hochstein has called for additional measures to ensure UN resolution 1701 was implemented "fairly, accurately and transparently". Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775538_1_20241021212807.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US special envoy Amos Hochstein said on Monday that the United States was working on a formula to end the conflict between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah for good, and that merely committing to a previous UN resolution would not be enough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 states that only the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers should be deployed in southern Lebanon, while demanding the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It may have ended the last round of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in 2006, but the Iranian-backed Shi'ite movement did not end its presence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Attention has focused on the resolution again during the latest Israel-Hezbollah war that erupted last month after nearly a year of cross-border fire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hochstein, visiting Lebanon for the second time in two months, was holding talks with Lebanese officials in a new US mediation push to bring peace to the Middle East after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Both sides simply committing to (UN resolution) 1701 is not enough," Hochstein told a press conference in the capital Beirut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the resolution remained as a basis for ending the conflict, additional measures were needed to ensure it was implemented "fairly, accurately and transparently".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are working with government of Lebanon, the state of Lebanon, as well as the government of Israel to get to a formula that brings an end to this conflict once and for all," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's assault on Hezbollah has raised fears of a wider regional conflict between Israel and Hezbollah's patron, Iran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After what he called a "very constructive" meeting with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a close ally of Hezbollah who has been engaging in diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, Hochstein said:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The United States wants to end this conflict absolutely as soon as possible. That is what President Biden wants, that is what we all are working towards." (Reuters/AFP)

    Moldova votes in favour of EU membership

  <img alt="The “No” vote in favour of Moldova's EU membership appeared to be ahead until the last few thousand votes were counted. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775551_1_20241022004607.jpg&q=1" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Moldovans voted, by a razor-thin majority, in favour of securing the country’s path toward European Union membership by 2030, electoral data showed on Monday, after the pro-Western president accused “criminal groups” of trying to undermine the vote in the former Soviet republic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The “No” vote appeared to be ahead until the last few thousand votes were counted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With 99.41 percent of votes counted in the EU referendum held Sunday, the “Yes” vote stood at 50.39 percent and the “No” vote at 49.61 percent, according to the Central Electoral Commission.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the presidential race that was held at the same time, President Maia Sandu won the first round with 42 percent of the vote in a field of 11, short of an outright majority. She will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who outperformed polls with around 26 percent of the vote, in a runoff on November 3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Monday, Sandu reiterated claims that unprecedented voter fraud and foreign interference had undermined the voting, calling it a “vile attack” on Moldova’s sovereignty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Unfortunately, the justice system failed to do enough to prevent vote-rigging and corruption," she told a news conference. “Here, too, we must draw a line, correct what went wrong, and learn the lesson. We heard you: we know we must do more to fight corruption.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moldovan authorities claim that Moscow has intensified a “hybrid war” campaign to destabilise the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections and backing a major vote-buying scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russia has repeatedly denied interfering, and, in turn, called on Sandu to "present evidence" of election interference in the country of 2.6 million people and alleged "anomalies" in Moldova's vote count.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU defended Sandu, with president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen hailing the outcome of the referendum in a post on X: "In the face of Russia's hybrid tactics, Moldova shows that it is independent, it is strong and it wants a European future!"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moldova applied to join the EU in the wake of the outbreak of Russia’s war with Ukraine in February 2022, and was granted candidate status, alongside Ukraine. Membership negotiations were agreed to start in June. (Agencies)

    Britain's King Charles heckled by Australian senator

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Britain's King Charles was accused of "genocide" by an Indigenous senator at Australia's Parliament House on Monday, moments after he delivered a speech in which he paid his "respects to the traditional owners of the lands".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Charles, on his 16th official visit to Australia and his first major foreign trip since being diagnosed with cancer, had finished speaking when independent senator and Indigenous activist Lidia Thorpe shouted that she did not accept Charles' sovereignty over Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You committed genocide against our people," she said. "Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us – our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want treaty."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thorpe, who has disrupted previous events protesting over the colonisation of Australia, was stopped from approaching the king, who spoke quietly to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the podium but was otherwise unfazed. Thorpe was then escorted out of the chamber.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The protest was an outlier among a stream of tributes to Charles and Queen Camilla from dignitaries and well-wishers in the crowds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Albanese praised Charles for his long advocacy about the threat of climate change and spoke about the respect Australians had for their monarch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visit to parliament followed a trip to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra where the royal couple met more than a thousand well-wishers including Hephner, a nine-year old alpaca in a suit with a crown perched atop his fluffy white head.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hephner, named after Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, waited for hours alongside owner Robert Fletcher and long lines of others outside the memorial for the chance to greet the royal couple on their one-day tour of the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He has many outfits and this is one we've saved specifically for today," said Fletcher. "One king meets another king."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hephner's patience paid off. On a 30-minute walk to greet the crowds, Charles stopped to pat the alpaca, pulling back with a laugh when Hephner snorted in his face.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The royal couple continue their visit to Australia in Sydney on Tuesday, before heading to Samoa for a meeting of countries in the British Commonwealth. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korea on Monday summoned the Russian ambassador to criticise what it claimed as Pyongyang's decision to send thousands of soldiers to support Moscow's war in Ukraine, the foreign ministry there said, calling for their immediate withdrawal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 1,500 North Korean special forces soldiers are already in Russia acclimatising and likely to head to the front lines soon, Seoul's spy agency said on Friday, with additional troops set to depart soon, Pyongyang's first such deployment overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea has long claimed the nuclear-armed North is supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, and Seoul expressed alarm over the troop deployment, which comes after Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a military deal in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul expressed its "grave concerns regarding North Korea's recent dispatch of troops to Russia and strongly urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean forces", vice foreign minister Kim Hong-kyun told Russian ambassador Georgiy Zinoviev.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency released detailed satellite images showing the first batch of 1,500 North Korean special forces from the elite "Storm Corps" had arrived in Vladivostok on Russian military vessels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move "poses a significant security threat not only to South Korea but to the international community", Kim said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For his part, Russian ambassador Zinovyev "stressed that cooperation between Russia and North Korea... is not directed against the interests of South Korea's security", the embassy said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday that it hopes all parties will work to de-escalate the situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “China’s position is consistent and clear,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said during a regular briefing in Beijing, as he urged parties involved to “commit themselves to a political solution".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato, which has not yet confirmed the North Korean troop deployments, said that it "would mark a significant escalation" in the conflict, chief Mark Rutte said on X. (AFP/Reuters)

    Cuba's power grid collapses again as storm hits

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cuba's electrical grid collapsed again on Sunday, the fourth such failure in 48 hours, with a hurricane making landfall to compound the island's misery and threaten further havoc on its infrastructure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba earlier on Sunday had said it was making headway restoring service after multiple false starts, though millions of people remained without electricity more than two days after the grid's initial collapse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Restoration work began immediately," the country's energy and mines ministry said on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hurricane Oscar made landfall on the Caribbean island on Sunday, bringing strong winds, a powerful storm surge and rain to parts of eastern Cuba and threatening to further complicate the government's efforts to reestablish service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba's meteorological survey warned of "an extremely dangerous situation" in eastern Cuba, while the US National Hurricane Center reported winds of 120 kilometres per hour as the storm made its way across the island.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On the forecast track, the center of Oscar is expected to continue moving across eastern Cuba tonight and Monday, then emerge off the northern coast of Cuba late Monday and cross the central Bahamas on Tuesday," the Hurricane Center said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government canceled school through Wednesday – a near unprecedented move in Cuba – citing the hurricane and the ongoing energy crisis. Officials said only essential workers should report to work on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The repeated grid collapses marked a major setback in the government's efforts to quickly restore power to exhausted residents already suffering from severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The multiple setbacks in the first 48 hours also underscored the complexity of the work and the still precarious state of the country's grid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba had restored power to 160,000 clients in Havana just prior to the grid's Sunday collapse, giving some residents a glimmer of hope.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But housewife Anabel Gonzalez, of old Havana, a neighborhood popular with tourists, said she was growing desperate after three days without power.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My cell phone is dead and look at my refrigerator. The little that I had has all gone to waste," she said, pointing to bare shelves in her two-room home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Energy and mines minister Vicente de la O Levy told reporters earlier on Sunday he expected the grid to be fully functional by Monday or Tuesday but warned residents not to expect dramatic improvements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was not immediately clear how much the latest setback would delay the government's efforts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba's national electrical grid first crashed around midday on Friday after the island's largest power plant shut down, sowing chaos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The grid collapsed again on Saturday morning, state-run media reported
   <br/>
   <br/>
   By early evening on Saturday, authorities reported some progress restoring power before announcing another partial grid collapse. (Reuters)

    Pope creates 14 new saints at Vatican ceremony

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pope Francis created a new group of saints on Sunday, canonising 14 individuals including the "martyrs of Damascus", killed in Syria during the Ottoman Empire and symbols of Christian persecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Francis presided over the canonisation ceremony in Saint Peter's Square in the presence of thousands of Catholic faithful from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We enrol them among the saints, decreeing that they are to be venerated as such by the whole Church," proclaimed Francis, after reciting each name.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canonisation is the final step towards sainthood in the Catholic Church, following beatification.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Three conditions are required -- most crucially that the individual has performed at least two miracles. He or she must be deceased for at least five years and have led an exemplary Christian life.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the group are 11 individuals known as the "martyrs of Damascus", who have become saints some 160 years after their death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The eight Franciscan friars and three lay Maronites -- all siblings -- from a monastery were assassinated by Druze militants in July 1860 in the Syrian capital, then under Ottoman rule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They were beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1926.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Damascus is home to one of the oldest Christian communities in the world but its Christian population has dwindled to only about two percent today, according to the Vatican.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many citizens, Christian and otherwise, have left the city since the start of Syria's civil war in 2011.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The martyrdom of the Damascus group canonised on Sunday "is not very different from the situation of many Christians in the Middle East today", wrote Vatican News, the official news portal of the Vatican.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The other three individuals, who died early in the 20th century, founded religious communities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They are Italian missionary Giuseppe Allamano, Italian nun Elena Guerra and the Canadian Marie-Leonie Paradis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In May, Pope Francis announced he would canonise Italian teenager Carlos Acutis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The London-born adolescent spent his life spreading his faith online, earning the moniker "God's Influencer", before dying from leukaemia in 2006.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The date of that canonisation has not yet been set but it could take place in 2025, the Church's Jubilee year, when more than 30 million pilgrims are expected to descend on Rome. (AFP)

  <img alt="Prabowo Subianto, right, is sworn in as Indonesia's president as his predecessor Joko Widodo applauds. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775358_1_20241020134108.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto on Sunday took over as president of the world's third-largest democracy after sweeping the country's election with policies like free meals for schoolchildren and with the outgoing leader's son as his running mate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 73-year-old former special forces commander won the February 14 contest with nearly 60 percent of the vote and has spent the past nine months building a formidable parliamentary coalition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prabowo, wearing a traditional black hat and navy suit with a woven maroon and golden sarong, officially became Indonesia's eighth president on Sunday morning after he was sworn in during a ceremony at Indonesia's parliament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Xi Jinping congratulated him on taking office.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his message to Prabowo, Xi said China and Indonesia have traditionally been friendly neighbours, and the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year will create opportunities for further bilateral cooperation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vice President Han Zheng, as Xi's special representative, attended the inauguration.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new Indonesian leader, who unsuccessfully ran for the presidency twice before, said in a speech to lawmakers after taking his oath of office that he would be president for all Indonesians, even those who did not vote for him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said there were internal issues in the country that had to be grappled with, including corruption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Do we realise that our people and our children are malnourished? So many of our people don't have good jobs. So many of our schools are neglected," Prabowo said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ladies and gentlemen, we have to be courageous looking at all of this, and we have to be courageous solving all these problems."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was joined in the swearing-in ceremony by his running mate, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, 37, the eldest son of outgoing President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Flower boards set up outside the presidential palace congratulated Prabowo and Gibran, and thanked Jokowi for his decade as president.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jokowi supporters also attended celebrations to bid farewell to Indonesia's outgoing leader.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anneta Yuniar, a bystander who had excitedly waved at Jokowi's motorcade as it slowly made its way past supporters before the ceremony, said she would miss Jokowi but that Prabowo was a strong leader.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Prabowo will continue the development that Jokowi started. There's continuity. It's what I want," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jokowi has left an indelible mark on the nation of 280 million, presiding over a period of strong economic growth and massive infrastructure development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Critics also say, though, his rule has been marked by a rise in old-time patronage and dynastic politics, and they warn about diminished integrity in courts and other state institutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indonesian police and military have put in place strict security measures, deploying at least 100,000 personnel across the city, including snipers and anti-riot units. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Chinese Consulate in Myanmar’s second-largest city has been slightly damaged by an explosive device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The blast occurred at the consulate office in central Mandalay, south of the sprawling Royal Palace, around 7pm on Friday, local media said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were no casualties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the Myanmar military blamed "terrorists" for the explosion that damaged roof tiles on the two-storey consulate, adding that security forces were investigating in order to arrest anyone found responsible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No public claims of responsibility were made for the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, a resident living near the consulate in Mandalay’s Chanmyathazi township said security around the site has since been tightened, with nearby roads closed after the explosion.

    Mexican navy seizes record 8.3 tonnes of drugs

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Mexican navy announced on Saturday it had seized more than 8.3 tonnes of drugs in the Pacific Ocean, a record for a single operation at sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Navy personnel seized 8,361 kilogrammes of illicit cargo, which represents the largest amount of drugs seized in a maritime operation, unprecedented in history," said a statement from the Ministry of the Navy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It did not specify the type of the drugs, but said they were valued at 2.099 billion pesos (US$105 million).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Twenty-three people were arrested during the bust which took place southwest of the port of Lazaro Cardenas, off the western coast of Mexico.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drugs were distributed in six small boats and one of the vessels was a submersible, which implied a "complex" action on the part of the sailors, added the ministry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The largest drug seizure in Mexico's history was 23 tonnes of Colombian cocaine in November 2007.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mexico has for decades been the hub of drug trafficking to the United States, with a large number of cartels fighting for control of the trade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The state of Michoacan, off the coast of which the seizure took place, is the scene of clashes between criminal gangs, including the powerful Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful and violent criminal groups. (AFP)

   The regional assembly of Portugal's Azores Islands approved the creation of the largest protected marine area in the North Atlantic to reach international conservation goals well ahead of time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The approval places the archipelago at the forefront of global ocean conservation that aims to achieve the goals set by the United Nations of protecting 30 percent of the Earth's land and sea by 2030 under a global pact adopted last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The network will encompass almost 300,000 square kilometres and ensure the preservation of underwater mountain ranges and vulnerable marine ecosystems, including deep-sea corals, hydrothermal vents and marine species.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have acted in advance of the international conservation goals for 2030 with the creation of the largest marine park in the North Atlantic, with fully protected areas and highly protected areas," Bernardo Brito e Abreu, adviser to the Azorean government on maritime affairs said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He explained that half of the network would be designated as a fully protected area, which means fishing activities are not allowed. In the other half, designated as a highly protected area, only very selective fishing will be allowed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The nine-island archipelago is an autonomous region roughly 1,500 km west of mainland Portugal and home to unique marine biodiversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Azores government chief Jose Manuel Bolieiro said the region was leading by example at national, European and international levels in the management and protection of its waters and "making a significant contribution to Portugal meeting the international targets for the decade". (Reuters)

    Record high Colombian cocaine production in 2023: UN

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Colombia, the world's biggest cocaine exporter, set a new record last year for production of the drug and cultivation of the coca leaf it is made from, a United Nations report said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Coca leaf cultivation was 10 percent higher last year than in 2022, while cocaine production rose 53 percent from 1,738 tonnes to 2,600, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These were the highest numbers since the UN started monitoring in 2001. Most Colombian cocaine is destined for the United States and Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Coca leaf production now spreads over 253,000 hectares (625,100 acres) in the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The trend has been upward since 2014 despite a US-based war on drugs worth millions of US dollars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The areas of Colombia with the biggest increase in 2023 were the Cauca and Narino departments, both bastions of dissidents groups of the FARC guerrilla army that disbanded in 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 20 percent of the total area under coca cultivation in Colombia is on land belonging to communities of African descent, 10 percent on Indigenous reserves and 18 percent in protected forest areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Colombian city of Cali will host the COP16 global summit on biodiversity for two weeks starting on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Colombia's first-ever leftist President Gustavo Petro has accused US anti-drug policies of causing a "genocide" of Latin Americans for focusing on "repression" rather than prevention and public health. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on Friday night near Jabalia in the territory's north killed 33 people at a refugee camp.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal announced "33 deaths and dozens of wounded" while a medical source at the Al-Awda hospital said earlier that it had registered 22 dead and 70 wounded after the strike on the Tal al-Zaatar camp for Palestinian refugees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked for comment about overnight strikes in the area, an Israeli army spokesperson said they were "looking into it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On October 6, Israel launched a new offensive in northern Gaza, including around Jabalia, saying it was targeting Hamas fighters who were regrouping there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since then, scores of people have been killed in the area, which had already been hit hard by fighting earlier in the year-long war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The UN humanitarian affairs agency said on Friday night that it continued "to sound the alarm about the increasingly dire and dangerous situation that civilians in northern Gaza are facing. Families there are trying to survive in atrocious conditions, under heavy bombardment." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cuba on Friday experienced a nationwide blackout after the island's main power plant failed, causing the country's electricity grid to collapse, the energy ministry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The system was left without power nationwide" after the unexpected shutdown of the Antonio Guiteras power plant, Lazaro Guerra, director general of electricity at the ministry of energy and mines, told state television.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When the thermoelectric plant shut down "the system collapsed," he said, adding the government was working to restore service as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero announced the island was in the throes of an "energy emergency," with severe supply shortages leaving some provinces without power for up to 20 hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government on Thursday suspended all non-essential public sector activities in order to prioritize electricity supply to homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba gets its power from eight ageing thermal power plants, as well as seven floating plants leased from Turkish companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The island nation has been under a severe embargo by the United States since 1958. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   An SUV driver who ran over a cyclist following an altercation in central Paris has been charged with murder after a court hearing, a source close to the case said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 52-year-old driver of the SUV is accused of having deliberately targeted the cyclist, 27, on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another judge will now rule whether he should be held in custody ahead of trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuesday's incident in Paris's wealthy 8th district comes as tensions rise in the battle for street space in the congested capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tense exchanges between cyclists and drivers are commonplace in the city centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The driver, whose teenage daughter was also in the car, was arrested on the spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, the motorist and the cyclist were seen having an angry dispute by the side of the road.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   French associations promoting cycling have condemned the incident, with "Paris en Selle" calling it "an unacceptable tragedy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year, 226 cyclists died on French roads. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Kyiv said on Friday it had received the bodies of 501 servicemen killed fighting Russian forces, mainly in eastern Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The exchange of prisoners and bodies of killed military personnel remains one of the few areas of cooperation between Moscow and Kyiv since Russia attacked in 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As a result of repatriation measures, 501 bodies of fallen Ukrainian defenders were returned to Ukraine," the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The announcement represents one of the largest repatriations of killed Ukrainian servicemen since the beginning of the war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the remains were returned from the eastern Donetsk region, said the agency. Russian forces have been advancing steadily there since their capture of the industrial hub of Avdiivka in February.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several state bodies had helped coordinate the return including the defence forces, the agency added, acknowledging the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Representatives of law enforcement agencies and forensic experts will identify the victims," the coordination centre said in its statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After identification, the bodies of our defenders will be handed over to their families for a proper burial." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday confirmed its leader Yahya Sinwar had been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, a day after Israel announced his death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We mourn the great leader, the martyred brother, Yahya Sinwar, Abu Ibrahim," Qatar-based Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya said in a recorded video statement broadcast by Al Jazeera.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinwar became Israel's most wanted man after the October 7, 2023 attack, the deadliest in Israeli history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his statement, Hayya said Hamas would not release the hostages it seized from Israel during the attack until the war in Gaza ends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The hostages "will not return... unless the aggression against our people in Gaza stops," the senior Hamas official said, as he called on Israel to withdraw from Gaza and release Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hayya said the militant group would take strength from Sinwar's killing, which he said has set him among "the leaders and symbols of the movement who preceded him." (AFP)

   British Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Beijing on an official two-day visit, with the UK's new Labour government seeking to demonstrate its willingness to engage in a pragmatic and strategic approach to ties with China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lammy's visit is only the second by a British foreign secretary in six years.
   <br/>

   Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the two sides would focus on implementing the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries during the phone talks in August, and have in-depth communication on enhancing strategic mutual trust and strengthening dialogue and cooperation in various fields.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said South Korea is a foreign and hostile nation, state media KCNA reported on Friday, with photos showing Kim conferring with high-ranking soldiers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim discussed the use of "offensive forces" against the South as retaliation for any move that infringes on its sovereignty, the report said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no elaboration on what forces might be used.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The report comes a day after KCNA said North Korea amended its constitution to designate the South as a "hostile state".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim has increasingly lashed out at South Korea this year, accusing Seoul of colluding with Washington to seek the collapse of his regime and has pushed for a clear break with decades of policy engagement with the South, including the scrapping of unification as a goal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The reclusive state blasted road and rail links with South Korea this week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Those actions underscored "not only the physical closure but also the end of the evil relationship with Seoul," KCNA quoted Kim as saying.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul has said that if North Korea were to inflict harm upon the safety of its people, "that day will be the end of the North Korean regime."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim made the remarks while inspecting the headquarters of the 2nd Corps of the North Korean army on Thursday, KCNA said, a major military unit that includes several forward-deployed brigades with heavy weapons aimed at the South.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the visit, he also said the changed nature of the South Korea-US alliance and their different, more developed military manoeuvres, highlight the importance of a stronger North Korean nuclear deterrent. (Reuters)

    Biden heads to Germany to discuss Middle East

  <img alt="US President Joe Biden gets ready to board Air Force One in Maryland. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775044_1_20241017214236.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US President Joe Biden took off  onThursday on a swift farewell trip to Germany, for talks with allies to shore up Ukraine's increasingly desperate fight against Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was also expected to discuss the escalating crisis in the Middle East, as Israel said it was investigating whether Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar had been killed in a military operation in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a flying 24-hour visit to Berlin, the US leader will meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, before they are both joined for talks by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was originally due in Germany last week for a multi-day visit that would have included a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a major summit of Kyiv's allies, but he postponed it as Hurricane Milton barrelled towards Florida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The White House said the shorter, rescheduled visit to the key Nato ally would "further strengthen the close bond the United States and Germany share as allies and friends and coordinate on geopolitical priorities, including Ukraine's defence against Russian aggression and events in the Middle East."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was also keen to make the visit to thank Scholz for facilitating a prisoner exchange deal with Russia earlier this year that freed US reporter Evan Gershkovich, US officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the focus will be on Ukraine, with Biden, who dropped out of the 2024 White House race in July, keen to consolidate Western military aid for Kyiv in his final three months in office.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Allies are nervously watching the November 5 US presidential election to see if it brings a return of Donald Trump, who has opposed the current level of US support for Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump has also repeatedly pledged to push through a peace deal if elected -- even before taking office -- that Kyiv fears would involve it giving up chunks of land to Moscow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zelensky told allies in Brussels on Thursday that Ukraine must be in a position of strength before any peace talks with Russia, as he explained his "victory plan" to EU leaders and NATO defence chiefs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than two and a half years into the war, Kyiv is slowly but steadily losing territory in its eastern Donbas region and under mounting pressure to forge an exit strategy -- which it says must start with ramped-up Western support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden announced a fresh US$425 million arms package including air defense and armored vehicles for Ukraine in a call with Zelensky on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States is by far the biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine's battle against the 2022 Russian invasion, followed by Germany. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Israeli military on Thursday announced the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by its forces in southern Gaza the previous day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military "confirms that after a year-long pursuit, yesterday (Wednesday), October 16, 2024, IDF (military) soldiers from the Southern Command eliminated Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Hamas terrorist organisation, in an operation in the southern Gaza Strip," it said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The dozens of operations carried out by the IDF and the ISA (Shin Bet internal security agency) over the last year and in recent weeks in the area where he was eliminated restricted Yahya Sinwar's operational movement as he was pursued by the forces and led to his elimination," the military added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "IDF soldiers of the 828th Brigade (Bislach) operating in the area identified and eliminated three terrorists. The process of identifying the body confirms the elimination of Yahya Sinwar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel accuses Sinwar, 61, of being the mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, along with Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military has said Deif was killed in a strike earlier this year, though the Palestinian group has not confirmed it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, Sinwar took over as the leader of Hamas, following the death of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran on July 31. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hamas attack last year resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people on Israeli soil, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures that include hostages killed in captivity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed 42,438 people, a majority of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN acknowledges the figures reliability. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday said Ukraine must be in a position of strength before any peace talks with Russia, as he explained his "victory plan" to EU leaders and NATO defence chiefs in Brussels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than two and a half years into the war, Kiev is slowly but steadily losing new territory in its eastern Donbas region and under mounting pressure to forge an exit strategy -- which it says must start with ramped-up Western support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ukraine is ready for real diplomacy, but for it, we must be strong," Zelensky said as he headed into talks with the EU's 27 leaders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A forcefully imposed truce instead of fair peace never provided security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Russia will resort to diplomacy only when it sees that it cannot achieve anything by force," Zelensky added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is the plan. This is exactly what's needed, and we must create the right conditions to end this war."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the EU summit Zelensky was to join defence ministers for the first of two days of talks between NATO's 32 member states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While calling it a "strong signal," NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte cautioned ahead of time he was not endorsing Zelensky's "whole plan" -- which calls first and foremost for an immediate invitation to join the alliance, a plea widely seen as unrealistic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zelensky's plan also rejects any territorial concessions, calls for Western allies to lift restrictions on using donated long-range weapons to target Russian military sites, and suggests deploying a "non-nuclear strategic deterrence package" on Ukrainian territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ukrainian leader has travelled in recent weeks to Washington, Paris, Berlin, Rome and London to defend his plan -- unveiled to Ukrainian lawmakers Wednesday -- but it has yet to earn backing from Western capitals. (AFP)

    India slams 'cavalier' Trudeau over separatist murder

  <img alt="Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has come under renewed attack from India over his handling of the killing of a Sikh separatist in Canada. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774958_1_20241017133828.jpg&q=15" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   India criticised Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday as "cavalier" over his handling of the disastrous diplomatic fallout following the 2023 killing of a Sikh separatist in Canada.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Delhi held firm its defiant stance towards Ottawa -- an approach in sharp contrast to its compliant attitude this week towards the United States, where India is also accused of directing a separate assassination plot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canada has alleged that India arranged the killing of a Sikh separatist, naturalised Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, murdered in the parking lot of a Sikh temple in Vancouver in June 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India has called the allegations "preposterous".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Trudeau, at a parliamentary inquiry on Wednesday, said Canada had "clear indications that India had violated Canada's sovereignty".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canada's top envoy to New Delhi, Stewart Wheeler, who India has ordered to leave by Saturday night, has said Ottawa had provided "credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the Government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India's foreign ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday said they had not seen that evidence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Canada has presented us (India) no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations that it has chosen to level against India and Indian diplomats," he said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nijjar -- who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 -- had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four Indian nationals have been arrested in connection with Nijjar's murder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year, the Indian government briefly curbed visas for Canadians and this week both countries expelled each other's ambassadors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Delhi's response to Washington has been very different, with the US State Department on Wednesday saying India had told it that an intelligence operative accused of directing an assassination plot on American soil was no longer in government service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US prosecutors charged an Indian citizen last November over a foiled attempt in New York to kill an advocate for a separate Sikh homeland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The indictment described an "Indian government employee," who was not publicly named, as recruiting the hitman and directing the assassination plot remotely, including by arranging the delivery of US$15,000 in cash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India's Hindustan Times, quoting an unnamed US official, said on Monday that India not only removed but arrested the employee on "local charges."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The State Department did not confirm the arrest. (AFP)

    US uses stealth bombers to strike Houthi targets

  <img alt="The United States carried out B-2 bomber strikes on weapon storage facilities in areas of Yemen controlled by the Houthi rebels, according to the US military and defence department. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774947_1_20241017121451.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   American long-range B-2 stealth bombers launched airstrikes early on Thursday morning targeting underground bunkers used by Yemen's Houthi rebels, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It wasn't immediately clear what damage was done in the strikes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it is incredibly rare for the B-2 Spirit to be used in the strikes targeting the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin in a statement said the B-2 bombers targeted “five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike also appeared to be an indirect warning to Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor who have twice targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks over the last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,” Austin said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Austin and the US military's Central Command offered no immediate assessment on the damage done.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships travelling through the waterway, which once saw US$1 trillion a year of cargo pass through it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started last October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a US-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the US or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Later on Thursday, the Houthis vowed to retaliate following the strike on the weapons storage facilities in areas controlled by the Iran-backed group.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We confirm that the American aggression will not pass without a response," said a statement from the group's political bureau. (Agencies)

   British singer Liam Payne, a former member of the group One Direction, died on Wednesday aged 31 after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Argentina, police in Buenos Aires said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Liam James Payne, composer and guitarist, former member of the band One Direction, died today after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Palermo," a police statement said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boy band sensation One Direction emerged in 2010 when then-teenagers Payne, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik appeared on the British television contest "The X Factor."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2016, the group announced it was going on an indefinite hiatus, but not splitting up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Payne announced he was working on a solo album that same year, following in the footsteps of other band members. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday proposed closer three-way ties with Russia and Mongolia at a meeting with counterparts from the neighbouring countries on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Li said the nation is willing to make contributions to the development and revitalisation of the two countries and the prosperity and stability of the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He told Mishustin that China was willing to strengthen trade and energy ties with Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li added that enhancing cooperation and promoting deeper and practical trilateral cooperation with Russia and Mongolia would better benefit the people of the three countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mongolia is not a member of the SCO, having chosen instead to be an observer state since 2004. The landlocked nation is on the planned route of a major pipeline that Russia wants to build to carry 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas each year from its Yamal region to China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Eurasian leaders have gathered in the Pakistani capital Islamabad for the SCO summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Addressing the event, Li said the SCO is an important platform for safeguarding regional peace and stability and promoting the development and prosperity of all countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his opening remarks, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for the expansion of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Flagship projects like the Belt and Road Initiative of President Xi Jinping, the China-Pakistan economic corridor, which is in its second phase and the international north south transport corridor, should be expanded focusing on developing road, rail and digital infrastructure that enhances integration and cooperation across our region," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in attendance was India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who is the first Indian foreign minister to visit Pakistan in nearly a decade with ties between the nuclear-armed rival neighbours continuing to be frosty. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Russia has captured two more villages in different parts of eastern Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Wednesday, as Russian forces continue their steady advance in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moscow has been claiming gains in Ukraine's embattled east regularly since the summer, advancing towards the city of Pokrovsk, from where thousands have fled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its defence ministry said troops had captured the village of Krasnyi Yar, south of the town of Myrnograd, which lies close to Pokrovsk.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ukraine has rushed evacuations of tens of thousands of people from Pokrovsk and Myrnograd as Russian troops advance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Further north, Moscow also said it had captured the village of Nevske, which lies in the Lugansk region, near the border with the Donetsk region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It published images of a village with one main road, lined with heavily destroyed houses, and a Russian soldier flying Moscow's flag through a window of a badly damaged house.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The aerial footage showed the small village to be almost entirely destroyed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moscow made the claims as Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky presented his vision of how to end two years of fighting to parliament in Kyiv.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In it, he rejected any territorial concessions and urged for ramped-up Western backing, including an invitation to join Nato. (AFP)

  <img alt="Smoke billows over Beirut's southern suburbs after an Israeli strike, amid the ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774815_1_20241016165057.jpg&q=1" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israeli strikes have killed at least 15 people in the southern Lebanese town of Qana while the Israeli military attacked Beirut's southern suburbs early on Wednesday for the first time in nearly a week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strikes in Qana late on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lebanon's Civil Defence said 15 bodies had been recovered from the rubble of a building and that rescue efforts were still underway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the strikes on southern Beirut were the first in six days, and came after Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the United States had given him assurances that Israel would curb its strikes on the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no immediate word on casualties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah has a strong presence in southern Beirut, known as the Dahiyeh, which is also a residential and commercial area home to large numbers of civilians and people unaffiliated with the militant group.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military said it targeted an arms warehouse under a residential building.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It posted an evacuation warning on the X platform ahead of the strike, saying it was targeting a building in the Haret Hreik neighbourhood.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on October 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, following the surprise Hamas attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A year of low-level fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border escalated into all-out war last month , and has displaced some 1.2 million people in Lebanon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 2,300 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since last October, more than three-quarters of them in the past month, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. (AP)

    Harris mocks Trump after rally turns into dance-a-thon

  <img alt="On Monday two medical emergencies in the crowd turned into a bizarre 39 minutes of music and dancing as Donald Trump played nine of his favourite songs. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774708_1_20241016120547.jpg&q=60" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Kamala Harris went after her US presidential election rival Donald Trump's mental state and fitness for office on Tuesday after the 78-year-old Republican's televised town hall veered into a surreal, impromptu music session.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Three weeks ahead of the US election, Harris's campaign has begun to focus aggressively on Trump's health and mental stability, and was quick to weigh in, saying the ex-president appeared "lost, confused, and frozen on stage."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For about half an hour, Monday's event in Oaks near Philadelphia was standard fare ahead of the November 5 election, as Trump took friendly questions from supporters on the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a pause for two medical emergencies in the crowd turned into a bizarre 39 minutes of music and dancing as Trump abandoned the discussion of the election to put on his favourite hits, swaying awkwardly on stage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?" he said, bringing the Q&A section to an abrupt end and telling his people to crank up the volume.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump has made a brief, jerky dance his signature at the end of rallies for years, nearly always to his exit song – the Village People's 1978 disco anthem "YMCA."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Monday, however, he stayed on stage for nine songs, ranging from opera to Guns N' Roses and Elvis, with the ex-president alternating his dance moves with standing in place and staring into the crowd.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hope he's okay," Harris opined dryly on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Undeterred, Trump was bopping to the Village People again on Tuesday at a rally in Atlanta, where he turned up 90 minutes late and didn't mention the previous night's events or the criticism.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Delivering his usual stump speech focusing on illegal immigration, Trump pushed his now-customary falsehoods and exaggerations about migrant crime in Colorado and Ohio and referred to the country as "occupied" by foreign criminals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But if he was trying to draw a line under Monday's strangeness, he didn't succeed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump called the two world wars "beautiful" and claimed to have invented the word "caravan." Explaining how he was going to make America great again, he lurched into an aside about his wealthy friends, beachwear and President Joe Biden.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have a lot of rich friends. They go here. They go there. They're boring as hell," he began, apropos of nothing in particular. "Nobody cares. They put on their bathing suit. They don't look a lot better than Biden."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Harris and Trump are locked in a dead heat, according to polls, and the election is set to be decided by seven swing states where the margins could come down to a few thousand votes each.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Republican is the oldest person ever to be nominated for a presidential bid, after Biden dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate that sparked fears about his own age.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump has not released a recent comprehensive report on his state of health, prompting fierce criticism from Harris, 59, who has increasingly been homing in on Trump's age and physical and mental condition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the topic of her closing argument as she sat down with popular radio host Charlamagne tha God in an effort to boost her messaging to black male voters – a part of the electorate where Trump has made gains.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After setting out her policies for improving the lives of African American men, she turned to Trump's rallies and repeated a claim that riled him during their September debate – that bored supporters were leaving his rallies early.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This man is weak and he is unfit," Harris said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump had begun the day with a less freewheeling tone at an Economic Club of Chicago event, where he said he was for slapping "obnoxious" tariffs on trading partners like Mexico so that companies move factories to the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff," Trump said. (AFP)

    Japan warns against Korean 'escalation'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's government warned on Wednesday against "escalation" on the Korean peninsula, after North Korea blew up sections of deeply symbolic roads and railways connecting it to the South.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These North Korean activities could increase tensions between the South and the North, and it is important that this does not lead to an escalation," said Kazuhiko Aoki, deputy chief cabinet secretary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The North blew up the roads and railways on Tuesday, Seoul's military said, adding it had conducted a "counter-fire" operation in response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pyongyang's military last week vowed to permanently seal its southern border after spending months laying mines and building anti-tank barriers in the wake of leader Kim Jong-un declaring the South his country's "principal enemy".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The North also accused Seoul of using drones to drop anti-regime propaganda leaflets on the capital Pyongyang, with Kim convening a security meeting to direct a plan of "immediate military action" in response, state media reported Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The government will do its utmost to collect, analyse and monitor necessary information on future developments in North Korea," Aoki told a regular briefing in Tokyo. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774656_1_20241015232757.jpg&q=1" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris could sit down for an interview with popular podcaster Joe Rogan, whose audience leans heavily towards young men, as she works to shore up support with male voters, sources said on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the final stretch of the US presidential campaign, Harris campaign officials met with Rogan's team this week but an appearance has not been confirmed yet, said two of the sources, who have knowledge of the matter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rogan, who runs the most popular podcast in the United States, has a highly coveted and devoted following that numbers in the tens of millions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The interview will offer Harris an opportunity to make her case to his followers, as she works to shore up support with male voters and black men in particular. Numerous public polls suggest Republican nominee Donald Trump could outperform among young men of all races.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Harris has recently lost ground in particular among black men, a key demographic that helped Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020, and on Monday she launched a new economic plan to court them.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Her "opportunity agenda" is designed to give them "tools to achieve financial freedom, lower costs to better provide for themselves and their families, and protect their rights," her campaign said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Her campaign is also ramping up outreach to the typically Democratic voting group.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a rare move, Harris on Wednesday will sit for an interview with Fox News – to reach out to undecided right-leaning voters put off by the former president and counter Republican claims that she is avoiding media scrutiny.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fox News' day-to-day programming is heavy on conservative punditry that often explicitly supports Trump.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Monday, Trump said he also plans to go on Joe Rogan's podcast before Election Day on November 5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump and Rogan have sparred in the past. As recently as August, Trump took a shot at Rogan on his social media platform Truth Social but later called him a "good guy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2022, Rogan said he is not a Trump supporter and in August said he preferred Robert F Kennedy Jr, for president. Kennedy has since dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump. (Reuters/AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The World Conker Championships said on Tuesday it was investigating allegations of cheating after this year's men’s winner was found to have a steel chestnut in his pocket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than 200 enthusiasts of the traditional game entered the annual competition on Sunday in the small village of Southwick in central England.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The game involves players using conkers – the glossy brown seeds from the horse chestnut tree – threaded onto a string to try and smash their opponent’s chestnut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each player takes three alternate strikes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Veteran player Dave Jakins, 82, won the men's tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But organisers said they launched an investigation after claims that he may have used a steel chestnut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The allegations were raised by Alastair Johnson-Ferguson, who lost in the men’s final against Jakins after his conker “disintegrated in one hit," The Telegraph newspaper reported.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Organisers confirmed a steel conker was found in Jakins' pocket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investigations were ongoing, but they said that it appeared unlikely that he was able to cheat under the scrutiny of judges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jakins has denied the allegations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “He was very closely watched by four judges. It looks like it was absolutely impossible for him to cheat,” St. John Burkett, chair of the event's organising committee, told Sky News.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The title of World Conker Champion went this year to Kelci Banschbach, originally from Indianapolis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 34-year-old was crowned “queen conker” after beating Jakins in the final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was the first American to win the title since the World Conker Championships began in 1965. (AP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel has issued military evacuation orders affecting more than a quarter of the country, the UN refugee agency said on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The figures underscore the heavy price Lebanese are paying as Israel steps up its campaign to defeat Hezbollah and destroy its infrastructure in their one-year conflict.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The UN refugee agency's Middle East Director Rema Jamous Imseis told a press briefing in Geneva that new Israeli evacuation orders to 20 villages in southern Lebanon meant that over a quarter of the country was now affected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "People are heeding these calls to evacuate, and they're fleeing with almost nothing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israeli strikes have killed at least 2,309 people over the last year, the Lebanese government said, and more than 1.2 million people have been displaced.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The majority have been killed since late September when Israel expanded its military campaign. The toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 50 Israelis, both soldiers and civilians, have been killed, according to Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel says its operation in Lebanon aims to secure the return of tens of thousands of its residents forced to flee their homes in northern Israel due to Hezbollah attacks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Later on Tuesday, Hezbollah said it had launched a barrage of rockets towards the northern Israeli city of Haifa, adding it was "in defence of Lebanon and its people" and in response to Israeli attacks on cities, villages and civilians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel expanded its bombing campaign in Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 22 people - most of them women - in an airstrike in the north on a house where displaced people were seeking refuge from Israeli strikes further south, health officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rescue workers were still pulling bodies out of the rubble in Aitou on Tuesday, local media reported, following one of the deadliest strikes on displaced families in Lebanon, after strikes earlier this month on the southern Lebanese town of Ain Deleb that left more than 30 dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel has not commented on the Aitou strike, but has repeatedly said it takes all possible precautions to avoid civilian casualties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   So far the main focus of Israel's military operations in Lebanon has been in the Bekaa Valley in the east, the suburbs of Beirut, and in the south, where UN peacekeepers have said that Israeli fire has hit their bases on numerous occasions and wounded peacekeepers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The UN Security Council on Monday expressed strong concern after several peacekeeping positions in southern Lebanon again came under fire amid clashes between the Israeli military and Hezbollah.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visiting a military base in central Israel where four soldiers were killed on Sunday by a Hezbollah drone strike, said Israel would continue to attack the movement "without mercy, everywhere in Lebanon – including Beirut".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah resumed a year ago when the militant group began firing rockets at Israel in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Middle East remains on high alert for Israel to retaliate against Iran for an October 1 barrage of missiles launched in response to Israel's assaults on Lebanon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Netanyahu's office said Israel would listen to the United States but would decide its actions according to its own national interest.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The statement was attached to a Washington Post article which said Netanyahu had told President Joe Biden's administration that Israel would strike Iranian military, not nuclear or oil, targets - suggesting a more limited counterstrike aimed at preventing a full-scale war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Qatar's emir accused Israel on Tuesday of exploiting "international inaction" on the Middle East crisis to move beyond its "aggression" in Gaza to build more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank and send troops into Lebanon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Qatar, the United States and Egypt have repeatedly mediated in an attempt to end the war in Gaza, which broke out a year ago when fighters from the Palestinian militant group Hamas burst into Israel from Gaza and killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's offensive has killed more than 42,000 people in Gaza, turned the enclave into piles of cement and twisted metal and created severe shortages of food, water and fuel. (Agencies)

  <img alt="A policeman patrols near the venue of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Islamabad. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774624_1_20241015190516.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Regional leaders on Tuesday arrived in Pakistan's capital Islamabad to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Security in the city is tight for the 23rd SCO summit, with Pakistan deploying 10,000 security personnel, including the army.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The SCO is the world's largest regional bloc in terms of geographic scope, and covers more than 40 percent of the world's population.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shakeel Ahmad Ramay, CEO of the Asian Institute of Eco-Civilisation Research and Development, said enhancing economic opportunities will be high on the summit's agenda.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China is creating economic linkages through trade and establishing special economic zones," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the last few years, China has increased its trade with SCO members, it's around US$383 billion right now."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another topic that will likely top the agenda, according to Ramay, is regional cooperation to combat terrorism, which has been a big issue for host Pakistan, with the country suffering the recent deadly attacks in Karachi in early October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ramay also said that more countries, like Saudi Arabia, are looking to join the SCO, but he underscored the difference between the SCO and other regional groups.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "SCO is a partnership organisation, not an alliance or a bloc, like BRICS, thus leaves it more to its members to decide to what extent they want to enhance cooperation," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, Premier Li Qiang received the honour guard at the Prime Minister's House, where he met his Pakistani counterpart, Shehbaz Sharif, ahead of the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sharif and Li discussed economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, a US$65 billion investment in the South Asian country under the Belt and Road Initiative.

    North Korea blows up roads connected to the South

  <img alt="People watch a news report on North Korea blowing up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774615_1_20241015165124.jpg&q=1" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   In a symbolic display of anger, North Korea on Tuesday blew up the northern section of unused roads that once linked it with the South, with the rivals exchanging threats days after the North claimed that its rival flew drones over its capital Pyongyang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The roads’ choreographed demolition underlines North Korea’s growing anger against South Korea’s conservative government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to sever relations with South Korea and abandon the goal of achieving peaceful Korean unification.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Observers say it’s unlikely Kim will launch a preemptive, large-scale attack on South Korea because of fear that an almost certain massive retaliation by the more superior forces of the United States and South Korea would threaten Pyongyang's survival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to the explosions, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said its military fired within southern sections of the border as it bolstered its readiness and surveillance posture.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The statement did not give details, but the move could have been an attempt to avert cross-border fire by North Korea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It wasn't immediately known whether North Korea responded.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which handles affairs with North Korea, separately condemned the North’s detonations as a “highly abnormal” and “regressive” measure that violates previous inter-Korean agreements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Video provided by South Korea’s military showed a cloud of white and grey smoke emerging from the explosion at a road near the western border town of Kaesong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korean trucks and excavators could be seen clearing out debris. Another video showed smoke emerging from a coastal road near the eastern border. (AP)

    Li Qiang inaugurates Beijing-funded Pakistan airport

  <div class="itemFullText">
   After arriving in Islamabad, Premier Li Qiang received the honour guard at the Prime Minister's House, where he met his Pakistani counterpart, Shehbaz Sharif, on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan's capital was under strict security lockdown as Li landed in the city ahead of a heads-of-government gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation this week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both the premiers held delegation-level talks. Sharif's office said that he and Li discussed economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a US$65 billion investment in the South Asian country under President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They both also inaugurated virtually the CPEC-funded Gwadar International Airport in southwestern Balochistan province in a ceremony telecast live by Pakistan's state run TV.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li hailed the new international airport as a vivid illustration of the special friendship between China and Pakistan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the strategic guidance of President Xi and Pakistani leaders, the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership has been continuously deepened, and the China-Pakistan ironclad friendship, which has stood the test of changes in the international situation, is unbreakable, Li said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Premier also met with the country's top military officials including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of the Pakistan Army Sahir Shamshad Mirza, according to Xinhua news agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noting that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China and Pakistan have always respected and supported each other, Li said that the two countries are good brothers and good partners who have stood the test of the changing international landscape and truly shared weal and woe and helped each other.

  <img alt="Giant Panda statues are seen at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774560_1_20241015110842.jpg&q=25" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two giant pandas on Tuesday departed the mainland for a zoo in the US capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bao Li, a male panda, and female Qing Bao, both three years old, were headed to the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington under a decade-long breeding and research agreement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China and the United States have made orderly arrangements... to ensure that the two giant pandas will arrive at the Washington National Zoo safely and smoothly," the China Wildlife Conservation Association said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lu Yongbin, party secretary of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda committee, said at the farewell ceremony in Sichuan that the new round of China-US cooperation will boost bilateral collaboration in endangered species and biodiversity protection and enhance the friendship between the Chinese and American people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bao Li and Qing Bao were accompanied by an experienced breeder and a veterinarian to help them adapt quickly to their new environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Only a few of the beloved black-and-white bears remain in the US after almost all were returned to China in recent years under pre-arranged contracts – including all three of the National Zoo's pandas last November.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Xi Jinping said after meeting his counterpart Joe Biden at a summit in California last November that China could send new pandas as "envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, San Diego Zoo welcomed two new giant pandas, the first to be sent by the nation to the US in 21 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anticipation for the pandas' arrival in Washington was high, with the National Zoo's website emblazoned with a banner that read: "The pandas are coming."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Something "giant" is "coming to Washington", the zoo said in a post on X, adding that it would be closed on Tuesday but that for "the safety of the pandas and staff, we will not disclose any additional timing".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Preparations were well underway at the zoo, where pandas have been star attractions for decades. Renovations have been undertaken at the panda habitat "to enhance the safety of the facilities and maximise space for the bears to roam", according to the zoo's website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new structures constructed for the pandas include shallow pools to allow them to bathe and bamboo stands that require the bears to mimic the foraging techniques they would use in the wild.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bears will not, however, be available to the public for more than a month after their arrival, as they will need to be quarantined and to acclimate to their new habitat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While en route, the pandas' in-flight meals will include bamboo shoots, carrots and Chinese cornbread, the China Wildlife Conservation Association said. (AFP/Xinhua)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Australia took aim at firms charging consumers for tap or bankcard payments on Tuesday, targeting "hefty" fees in a billion-dollar industry dominated by Visa and Mastercard.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The country's centre-left government said it would "ban debit card surcharges" from 2026 and work to lower the cost of other types of electronic payments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australians now use cash for less than 16 percent of transactions, spelling boom times for electronic payment providers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They take a cut of almost every transaction, charging retailers a fee of between one and two percent to run each payment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia's central bank estimates merchants paid more than US$4 billion in transaction fees from 2022-2023 alone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many small shops pass along these costs to the consumer. But some larger companies – such as global retail chains – are often able to negotiate substantial discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have said it was determined to bring costs down and to stop small vendors from being gouged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Consumers shouldn't be punished for using cards or digital payments, and at the same time, small businesses shouldn't have to pay hefty fees just to get paid themselves," said economy minister Jim Chalmers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the United States, Visa and Mastercard this year agreed to limit transaction fees and pay US$30 billion to end an anti-trust investigation.

   <br/>
   A court has since threatened to reject that deal as overgenerous to Visa and Mastercard. The European Union has longstanding caps on fees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Credit and debit card companies have previously warned that regulation would mean less competitive markets and only mask the cost for consumers. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A Russian court on Monday sentenced a French researcher to three years in a penal colony after finding him guilty of breaching a "foreign agent" law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The trial of Laurent Vinatier, who works for a Swiss conflict mediation NGO, comes amid tensions between Russia and the West over the Ukraine war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 48-year-old was arrested in Moscow in June and charged with gathering information on Russia's military without being registered as a "foreign agent".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge Natalya Cheprasova at Moscow's Zamoskvoretsky district court ruled that Vinatier was guilty and sentenced him to three years in a penal colony, two years less than the maximum possible sentence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His lawyer Pavel Mamonov told journalists: "We consider the sentence harsh and will definitely appeal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Frenchman had acknowledged violating Russian law, saying he was unaware he should have registered as a "foreign agent".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The prosecutor had requested a sentence of three years and three months, saying Vinatier "repented" but the case involved "significant threats connected to Russia's security".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another lawyer for Vinatier, Oleg Bessonov, had asked the judge to issue him with a fine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   French President Emmanuel Macron had demanded Vinatier's release, saying the "propaganda" against him "does not match reality".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vinatier was charged over a requirement introduced in 2022 that people who gather information on Russia's military and arms that could harm the country's national security, must register as "foreign agents".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tensions between Moscow and Paris are running high after France charged Russian-born Telegram founder Pavel Durov in August over illegal content on the popular social media platform, with the Kremlin warning against "political persecution". (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   India and Canada each expelled the other's ambassador and five other top diplomats, after New Delhi said its envoy had been named among "persons of interest" following the killing of a Sikh separatist leader.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Delhi said it was withdrawing its six diplomats from Canada, but Ottawa said it had served them notices of expulsion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Subsequent to those notices, India announced it would withdraw its officials," a statement from the Canadian foreign ministry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 2023 murder of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar crashed the country's diplomatic relations with India after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were "credible allegations" linking Indian intelligence services to the crime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The expulsion of the diplomats -- including the most senior envoys on both sides -- is a major escalation in the row.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India "decided to expel" Ottawa's acting High Commissioner Stewart Wheeler, his deputy and four first secretaries, ordering they leave before midnight on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ottawa announced similar measures in return, with Canadian police saying they had "evidence pertaining to agents of the government of India's involvement in serious criminal activity" in Canada.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said that India had refused to cooperate in the investigation, or to lift diplomatic immunity for its envoys.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The decision to expel these individuals was made with great consideration and only after the RCMP gathered ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case," she said in a statement, referring to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nijjar -- who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 -- had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four Indian nationals have been arrested in connection with Nijjar's murder, which took place in the parking lot of a Sikh temple in Vancouver in June 2023. (AFP)

    NASA probe Europa Clipper lifts off for Jupiter's moon

  <img alt="NASA probe is set to reach Europa, one of Jupiter's many moons, in five and a half years. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774510_1_20241015025222.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   NASA probe Europa Clipper lifted off from the US Kennedy Space Center on Monday, bound for an icy moon of Jupiter to discover whether it has the ingredients to support life.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lift-off took place aboard SpaceX's powerful Falcon Heavy rocket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The probe is set to reach Europa, one of Jupiter's many moons, in five and a half years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mission will allow the US space agency to uncover new details about Europa, which scientists believe could hold an ocean beneath its iced-over surface.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "With Europa Clipper, we're not searching for life on Europa, but we're trying to see if this ocean world is habitable, and that means we're looking for the water," said NASA official Gina DiBraccio, ahead of the launch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're looking for energy sources, and we're really looking for the chemistry there, so that we can understand what habitable environments might be throughout our whole universe," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If life's ingredients are found, another mission would then have to make the journey to try and detect it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The probe is the largest ever designed by NASA for interplanetary exploration. Europa Clipper is 30 metres wide when its immense solar panels -- designed to capture the weak light that reaches Jupiter -- are fully extended.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mission will look to determine the structure and composition of Europa's surface, its depth, and even the salinity of its ocean, as well as the way the two interact -- to find out, for example, if water rises to the surface in places.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The aim is to understand whether the three ingredients necessary for life are present: water, energy and certain chemical compounds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If these conditions exist on Europa, life could be found in the ocean in the form of primitive bacteria, explained Bonnie Buratti, the mission's deputy project scientist.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the bacteria would likely be too deep for the Europa Clipper to see.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The probe will cover 2.9 billion kilometres during its journey, with arrival expected in April 2030.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The main mission will last another four years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The probe will make 49 close flybys over Europa, coming as close as 25 kilometres above the surface.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 4,000 people have been working on the US$5.2 billion mission for around a decade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   NASA says the investment is justified by the importance of the data that will be collected. (AFP)

    Research on inequality wins Nobel economics prize

  <img alt="The Nobel memorial prize in economics has been awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A Robinson for research into differences in prosperity between nations. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774467_2_20241014185710.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson won the 2024 Nobel economics prize "for studies of how institutions are formed and affect prosperity", the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The prestigious award, formally known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, is the final prize to be given out this year and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns (HK$8.2 million).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Reducing the vast differences in income between countries is one of our time's greatest challenges. The laureates have demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for achieving this,” said Jakob Svensson, Chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The economics award is not one of the original prizes for science, literature and peace created in the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and first awarded in 1901, but a later addition established and funded by Sweden's central bank in 1968.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Past winners include a host of influential thinkers such as Milton Friedman, John Nash – played by actor Russell Crowe in the 2001 film "A Beautiful Mind" – and, more recently, former US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The economics prize has been dominated by US academics since its inception, while US-based researchers also tend to account for a large portion of winners in the scientific fields for which 2024 laureates were announced last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That crop of prizes began with US scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the prize for medicine on Monday and concluded with Japan's Nihon Hidankyo, an organisation of survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki who campaigned for the abolition of nuclear weapons landing the award for peace on Friday.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pakistan's capital was under strict security lockdown as Premier Li Qiang landed in the city on Monday ahead of a heads-of-government gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) this week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li's visit is the first by a Chinese premier to Pakistan in 11 years, Pakistan's Prime Minister's Office said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received Li at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government has announced a three-day public holiday in Islamabad, with schools and businesses shut and large contingents of police and paramilitary forces deployed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan army troops will be responsible for the security of the capital's Red Zone, the location of the parliament and a diplomatic enclave and where most of the meetings will take place, according to the interior ministry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The threat alert has been high in the South Asian nation ahead of the SCO summit, especially after the killing of two Chinese engineers and shooting to death of 21 miners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tensions have mounted after jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan called for a protest on October 15 to press for his release and agitate against the coalition government, following violent clashes between his party loyalists and security forces.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Islamabad has sought to curb all movement of Chinese nationals in the city, citing fears they could be targets for violence from separatist militants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 23rd meeting of the SCO, which comprises nine full members including China, India, Iran and Russia, is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday in Islamabad.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As well as attending the SCO summit, Li is also undertaking a four-day bilateral visit to Pakistan from Monday to Thursday, accompanied by senior officials, Pakistan's foreign office said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will lead their respective delegations to discuss economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a US$65 billion investment in the South Asian country under the Belt and Road Initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li will also inaugurate the CPEC funded Gwadar International Airport in restive southwestern Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, Pakistan's prime minister's office said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In addition to Li, the SCO participants will be represented by the prime ministers of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan as well as the first vice president of Iran and external affairs minister of India. (Reuters)

  <img alt="South Korea's military said it is "fully ready" to respond after North Korea ordered troops on the border to prepare to fire in an escalating dispute over drones. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774410_1_20241014131933.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korea's military on Monday said it was "fully ready" to respond after North Korea ordered troops on the border to prepare to fire in an escalating dispute over drone flights to Pyongyang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The nuclear-armed North has accused Seoul of flying drones over its capital to drop propaganda leaflets filled with "inflammatory rumours and rubbish".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It warned on Sunday that if another drone was detected, it would consider it "a declaration of war".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's military previously denied it was behind the flights, with local speculation centred on activist groups in the South, which have long sent propaganda and US currency northwards, typically by balloon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the North insists Seoul is officially to blame, announcing late on Sunday it had told eight artillery brigades already on war footing "to get fully ready to open fire", and reinforced air observation posts in Pyongyang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our military is closely monitoring the situation and standing fully ready for the North's provocations," Lee Seong-joon, a spokesman for the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) told a press briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pyongyang claims propaganda drones have infiltrated the capital's airspace three times in recent days, with leader Kim Jong-un's powerful sister threatening a "horrible disaster" unless they stop.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement early on Monday, Kim Yo-jong said the drone flights were "an unpardonable, malicious challenge to our state".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She has issued three similar back-to-back statements, calling on South Korea's military to come up with measures to prevent a recurrence of alleged violations of North Korean airspace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The JCS on Monday neither confirmed nor denied that Seoul's military was responsible for sending drones across the border, instead calling the North's claim "shameless".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The North can't even confirm the origin of a drone in the Pyongyang sky, but is placing blame on the South -- all the while keeping a shut mouth on its sending of a drone southward on 10 occasions," spokesman Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's military also said on Monday that the North appeared to be preparing to carry out explosions at roads connected to the South, days after Pyongyang said it would seal the border. (AP)
