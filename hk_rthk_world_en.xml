<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Sunday called a snap election for April 28, saying he needed a strong mandate to deal with the threat posed by US President Donald Trump, who "wants to break us so America can own us."
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments showed the extent to which relations between the US and Canada, two long-time allies and major trading partners, have deteriorated since Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened to annex it as the 51st state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the next election was not due until October 20, Carney is hoping to capitalise on a remarkable recovery by his Liberal Party in the polls since January, when Trump began threatening Canada and former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon being sworn in as prime minister on March 14, Carney had said he could work with and respected Trump. On Sunday, however, he took a more combative approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty," Carney told reporters after the Governor General - the personal representative of King Charles, Canada's head of state - approved his request for an election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our response must be to build a strong economy and a more secure Canada. President Trump claims that Canada isn't a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Carney's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on March 6 delayed a broad 25 percent tariff on some Canadian goods for 30 days. He has since imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and threatened reciprocal tariffs on additional goods, including Canadian dairy and lumber, on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The polling suggests that the number one concern that Canadians have right now is the potential negative fallout of Donald Trump and the threatened tariffs," said Nik Nanos, chief data scientist and founder of pollster Nanos Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney is "probably setting the groundwork for something a little more strident on April 2nd," Nanos said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former two-time central banker with no previous political or election campaign experience, captured the Liberal leadership two weeks ago by persuading party members he was the best person to tackle Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now he has five weeks to win over Canadians. On Sunday, Carney proposed cutting the lowest income tax bracket by one percentage point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls suggest the Liberals, who have been in power since 2015 and badly trailed the official opposition Conservatives at the start of the year, are now slightly ahead of their rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We moved from an election where people wanted change to an election that's really much more about leadership," said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ability of the Conservatives to attack the Liberals has been greatly diminished, because people are focused on the here and now and the near-term future, not on what happened over the last 10 years," he said by phone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Conservatives have sought to portray Carney as an elitist who plans to continue the Trudeau-era policy of high government spending. They also accuse him of being less than clear about how he transferred his personal financial assets into a blind trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney bristled last week when asked about the trust, and accused the reporter asking of engaging in "conflict and ill will". The prickly reaction could give hope to the Conservatives that Carney might stumble during what will be his first campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key to any victory will be a good performance in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec. Carney had trouble at one press conference when asked to respond in French, first misunderstanding the question and then answering in English.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, on the other hand, speaks flawless French and is a seasoned politician who has fought seven elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we need to do is put Canada first for a change," Poilievre said at a press conference on Sunday to launch his campaign, adding that his policies, including tax cuts and increased resource production, would bring back investment, helping Canada become more self-reliant and better equipped to stand up to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laura Stephenson, a politics professor at Western University in the Canadian city of London, said Carney's inexperience might not be that important given the Trump factor. "I have a feeling we're going to see a little more grace extended than is usually given to politicians during this campaign," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An online Angus Reid poll of 4,009 people released last week put the Liberals on 42 percent public support and the Conservatives on 37 percent. Angus Reid said the margin of error was around 1.5 percent, 19 times out of 20. (Reuters)

    Hamas official killed as Gaza death toll passes 50,000

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza killed a Hamas political leader, Salah al-Bardaweel, on Sunday, the militant group said, as Palestinian officials put the death toll from nearly 18 months of conflict at over 50,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bardaweel was a member of the Hamas decision-making body, the political office, and had held posts such as heading the Hamas delegation for indirect truce talks with Israel in 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His blood, that of his wife and martyrs, will remain fuelling the battle of liberation and independence," the group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After two months of relative calm in the war, Gazans have again been fleeing for their lives after Israel effectively abandoned a ceasefire, launching a new all-out air and ground campaign on Tuesday against Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions echoed throughout the north, central and southern Gaza Strip early on Sunday, as Israeli planes hit several targets in those areas in what witnesses said was an escalation of the attacks that began earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the aim of the new campaign is to force the group to give up remaining hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel launched its initial assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has accused Israel of breaking the terms of the January ceasefire agreement by refusing to begin negotiations for an end to the war and a withdrawal of its troops from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hamas has said it is still willing to negotiate and was studying "bridging" proposals from U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis called on Sunday for an "immediate" end to Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip, and for the resumption of dialogue for the release of hostages and a "definitive ceasefire".
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am saddened by the resumption of the intense Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip, with so many deaths and injuries", Francis wrote in his Angelus prayer, which was published Sunday as the 88-year-old was being discharged from more than five weeks in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I ask that the weapons be silenced immediately and that the courage be found to resume dialogue so that all the hostages can be freed and a definitive ceasefire reached", said Francis, who was set to return to the Vatican on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is once again very serious and requires the urgent commitment of the conflicting parties and the international community", he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Pope Francis greeted and thanked the faithful from a balcony of Rome's Gemelli hospital on Sunday, the first time the 88-year-old has been seen in public since his admission on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you, everyone", a weak-sounding Francis said into a microphone, as he sat in a wheelchair waving gently to hundreds of people gathered below, and doing the occasional thumbs-up sign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can see that woman with yellow flowers, well done", he said with a small smile, to laughter from the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, who has spent over five weeks in hospital battling pneumonia, was on the balcony for two minutes then was discharged immediately. (AFP)

<img alt="Turkish people take to the streets to protest the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, Istanbul mayor and CHP's presidential race candidate, in Kayseri, Turkey. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797031_1_20250323164214.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Turkish court formally placed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu under arrest as part of a graft investigation on Sunday, after a fourth night of mass protests sparked heavy clashes with riot police.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decision was confirmed by one of Imamoglu's lawyers, with the court also due to rule in a second "terror-related" probe into the popular opposition mayor, whose detention has sparked Turkey's worst street protests in over a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No despair! Keep fighting!" wrote the main opposition CHP party on X, denouncing it as "a political coup d'etat".
  <br>
  <br>
  The news came as voters cast their ballots in a CHP primary to name Imamoglu the party's candidate for the 2028 presidential race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The long-planned vote was the event which triggered the arrest of Imamoglu, who is widely seen as the only politician capable of challenging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was detained in connection with two probes alleging graft and "aiding a terror organisation", accusations which he on Saturday told police were "immoral and baseless".
  <br>
  <br>
  The move against him sparked protests in Istanbul that have since spread to more than 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces, unleashing running battles with police, who arrested 323 people overnight, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls opened at 8:00 am local time with 5,600 ballot boxes in 81 cities. The CHP said the vote was open to everyone, not just members, in the hope of a massive show of support for Imamoglu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I invite our nation... to the ballot box. We are casting our vote to support President Ekrem: for democracy, justice and the future," said his wife, Dilek Kaya Imamoglu, on X, shortly after voting with her son Selim.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the capital Ankara, riot police used water cannon to push back protesters, while in the western coastal city of Izmir police blocked a student march headed towards the local offices of the ruling AKP party. (AFP)

    Protests continue in Turkey after mayor arrested

<img alt="A protester in Istanbul waves Turkey's national flag. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796993_1_20250323083846.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Huge crowds gathered outside Istanbul City Hall late on Saturday for a fourth night of protests over the arrest of Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who has blasted official allegations against him as "immoral and baseless".
 <br>
  <br>
  The demonstrations, which began in Istanbul on Wednesday, have since spread to more than 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces, sparking clashes with riot police in the country's worst street protests in more than a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imamoglu's arrest -- for "terrorism" and "corruption" -- came just days before he was to have been formally named as the main opposition CHP's candidate in the 2028 presidential race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dictators are cowards!" and "AKP (Turkey's ruling party), you will not silence us!" read some of the placards in the Istanbul protest on Saturday night, which appeared bigger and denser than the previous night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers charged the City Hall gathering shortly after midnight (2100 GMT) using tear gas and forcing those who could to take refuge in the City Hall building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many were arrested, according to AFP journalists, but no official data was immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Riot police had earlier used rubber bullets, pepper spray and percussion grenades in clashes on the fringes of the rally, AFP correspondents said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the capital Ankara, riot police used water cannon to push back protesters, while in the western coastal city of Izmir police blocked a student march headed towards the local AKP offices.
  <br>
  <br>
  CHP leader Ozgur Ozel, addressing the massed protesters in Istanbul, told them they numbered "more than half a million".
  <br>
  <br>
  He vowed the mobilisation would "defend" Imamoglu and march on the courthouse where the mayor had been taken late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor was taken to the courthouse, about 10 kilometres away from the City Hall demonstration, with 90 of his co-defendants, protected by dozens of riot vans and a heavy police cordon.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Imamoglu's lawyers, his hearing on a "terrorism" charge concluded, while the hearing on a "corruption" charge was scheduled to follow in the middle of the night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police set up a tight security cordon around the courthouse while around 1,000 protesters stood nearby shouting slogans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Saturday, the 53-year-old mayor denounced the accusations against him as "immoral and baseless" in a statement released by City Hall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This process has not only harmed Turkey's international reputation but has also shattered the public's sense of justice and trust in the economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the mayor's arrest badly hurt the lira and caused chaos on Turkey's financial markets with the benchmark BIST 100 index closing Friday nearly 8.0 percent lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are here today to stand up for the candidate we voted for," 30-year-old Aykut Cenk told AFP outside the court, holding a Turkish flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just as people took the streets to stand up for Erdogan after the July 15 (2016) coup, we are now taking to the streets for Imamoglu," Cenk said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not the enemy of the state, but what is happening is unlawful."
  <br>
  <br>
  The unrest has spread rapidly despite a protest ban in Turkey's three largest cities and a warning from Erdogan that the authorities would not tolerate "street terror".
  <br>
  <br>
  "For four days, they have been doing everything they can to disturb the peace and divide our people," Erdogan said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The days when politics and justice are guided by street terror are totally in the past," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the evening, Istanbul Governor Davut Gul said the authorities would not allow anyone to enter or leave the city who was "likely to participate in illegal activities".
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have arrested 343 people since the start of the protests, the interior ministry said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkey's Journalists Union claimed the police had "deliberately targeted" journalists, saying many had been "severely beaten, shot with rubber bullets and had equipment broken".
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Imamoglu's detention, the CHP has vowed to press ahead with its primary on Sunday at which it would formally nominate him as the party's presidential candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has pledged to open voting to anyone, not just party members, in the hope of garnering massive support for the beleaguered mayor, who is widely seen as the only politician capable of challenging Erdogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Observers said the government would likely seek to block the vote. (AFP)

    Pope Francis to be discharged from hospital

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, who has been battling pneumonia for more than five weeks, will be discharged from hospital on Sunday but will need a further two months of rest at the Vatican, the head of his medical team said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis, 88, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 with a severe respiratory infection that became the most serious health crisis of his 12-year papacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Francis will return to the Vatican on Sunday, his doctors said it would take "a lot of time" for his aging body to fully heal.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they had prescribed the pope two months of repose, and had advised him against taking any meetings with large groups, or that require special effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recommendation for a period of convalescence of at least two months is very important," Sergio Alfieri, head of the pope's medical team, told the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis, who was fighting double pneumonia, suffered four acute attacks of what the Vatican called "respiratory crises" during his time in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfieri said that two of the crises had been critical, with the pope "in danger of his life".
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff no longer has pneumonia, but is also not completely healed from a "complex" infection involving several microorganisms, said the doctor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfieri emphasized that while Francis had used non-invasive ventilation through a mask over his mouth and nose to help breathe, the pope had never been intubated during his stay in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  One senior cardinal had said on Friday that the pope would need to "relearn to speak" after battling a respiratory infection for so long.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will take time before his voice returns to what it was before," said Alfieri.
  <br>
  <br>
  The doctor said the pope, who had gained some weight in recent years after using a wheelchair for knee and back pain, has now lost some weight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We haven't weighed him, but he has lost weight, surely," said Alfieri. "But, let's say, he had some 'in reserve,' so it doesn't worry us," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Luigi Carbone, vice director of the Vatican's healthcare service, said the pope would have a nurse caring for him when he returns to his Vatican residence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican said earlier on Saturday that Francis would make his first public appearance in more than five weeks on Sunday, to offer a blessing from the window of his hospital room before being discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope has been seen by the public only once during his hospital stay, in a photo the Vatican released last week, showing the pontiff at prayer in a hospital chapel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis wants to come to the hospital window around noon on Sunday to give a greeting and blessing, the Vatican said in its brief statement earlier on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A period of two months rest for Francis could lead to significant changes to the Vatican's calendar of upcoming events.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope had been set to meet with Britain's King Charles on April 8, and to lead the Vatican's annual celebrations for Easter on April 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson said on Saturday that the Vatican would decide about those appointments at a later date.

<img alt="Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement says the very existence of Palestinians in Gaza depends on Hamas giving up control. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796966_1_20250322215125.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement called on its Islamist rivals Hamas on Saturday to relinquish power in order to safeguard the "existence" of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas must show compassion for Gaza, its children, women and men," said Fatah spokesman Monther al-Hayek.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on Hamas to "step aside from governing and fully recognise that the battle ahead will lead to the end of Palestinians' existence" if it remains in power in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007 from the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, and subsequent attempts at reconciliation have failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The territory has been devastated by an Israeli offensive in retaliation for the assault by Hamas and other Palestinian militants on Israel on October 7, 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following disagreements over the next steps in a January 19 ceasefire in the Gaza war, Israel resumed air strikes on Tuesday, followed by ground operations the day after.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened to annexe parts of Gaza unless Hamas frees the remaining Israeli hostages seized in the October 7 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages taken that day, 58 are still being held, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel resulted in 1,218 deaths, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 50,000 people in Gaza have been killed in the war, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least three firefighters and a public servant have been killed in a wildfire in South Korea, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency in southeastern regions, authorities said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire, which began in Sancheong County on Friday afternoon, prompted the deployment of 304 personnel, along with 20 helicopters, according to South Korea's Interior Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 residents in 15 southern villages have been told to evacuate, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Four people – three firefighters and one public servant – have been confirmed to be dead," said a fire agency official.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wildfires occurred in several other areas across the country, with 16 instances reported on Saturday alone, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Interior Ministry later declared a state of emergency in Ulsan and North and South Gyeongsang provinces, due to "the extensive damage caused by simultaneous wildfires across the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The forest agency has issued "severe" fire warnings, its highest level, in 12 locations, including North and South Gyeongsang provinces, Busan and Daejeon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sancheong, in South Gyeongsang province, is about 250 kilometres southeast of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sections of the highways in the region have been closed as a safety measure, according to local reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi Sang-mok, South Korea's acting president, told relevant agencies to "mobilise all available equipment and personnel to quickly extinguish" the fire, his office said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two people including a girl were killed in an Israeli attack on a southern Lebanese town on Saturday, state media reported, after Israel launched air strikes in response to cross-border rocket fire.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Israeli enemy strike on the town of Touline resulted... in the death of two people, including a girl, and the injury of eight others, including two children," the National News Agency cited the health ministry's emergency unit as saying, describing it as a "preliminary toll."
  <br>
  <br>
  NNA had earlier reported a toll of one killed in Touline.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came as the Israeli military said it was launching air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon after intercepting cross-border rocket fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said three rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the region for the first time since a November ceasefire between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam warned the country risked being dragged into a "new war" after months of relative calm following a November 27 ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis will make his first public appearance on Sunday with a blessing and a wave from a window at Rome's Gemelli Hospital where he was admitted on February 14.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff has been battling pneumonia in both lungs after being hospitalised for breathing difficulties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pope Francis intends to wave and offer a blessing from the Agostino Gemelli hospital in Rome after Angelus prayers," The Vatican said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope has stopped using an oxygen mask. After an earlier series of breathing attacks, his breathing has improved and the Vatican said on Monday he was spending short moments breathing on his own.
  <br>
  <br>
  For most of the pope's hospital stay, including critical stages, the Vatican was publishing daily bulletins on the health of Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope's illness and the long spell in hospital have raised questions over who might lead the busy schedule of religious events leading up to Easter, the holiest period in the Christian calendar. (AFP)

    Heathrow 'fully operational' again after fire shutdown

<div class="itemFullText">
 Heathrow Airport said it was "fully operational" on Saturday but delays and cancellations were expected as Europe's busiest air hub resumed operations after a power station fire caused travel mayhem.
 <br>
  <br>
  The electricity substation blaze knocked out power at the London airport, closing it for most of Friday before some flights began to arrive and take off later in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shutdown affected thousands of passengers around the world and raised serious questions about the reliability of one of the UK's most critical pieces of infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today," an airport spokesperson said on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Teams across the airport continue to do everything they can to support passengers impacted by yesterday's outage at an off-airport power substation."
  <br>
  <br>
  About 1,350 flights were affected by Friday's closure, according to the Flightradar24 tracking website. Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced and had to be diverted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delays and cancellations were likely on Saturday as airlines scrambled to clear a backlog of flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Passengers travelling today should check with their airline for the latest information regarding their flight."
  <br>
  <br>
  British Airways said it expected to operate around 85 percent of its scheduled flights at the airport throughout the day. The airline would normally run about 600 arrivals and departures on a Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning to operate as many flights as possible to and from Heathrow on Saturday, but to recover an operation of our size after such a significant incident is extremely complex," a BA spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect around 85 percent of our Saturday Heathrow schedule to run, but it is likely that all travelling customers will experience delays as we continue to navigate the challenges posed by Friday's power outage at the airport."
  <br>
  <br>
  Restrictions on overnight flights have been temporarily lifted to help ease congestion, according to the UK's transport department. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Saturday that China, Japan and the South Korea have agreed to further strengthen communication, enhance mutual trust, and deepen cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang made the remarks in Tokyo while meeting the press together with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, after attending the 11th China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Foreign Ministers' Meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the three countries fully affirmed the positive progress made in their cooperation since the Ninth China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Summit, Wang said they agreed that against the backdrop of a complex and turbulent international landscape and sluggish recovery of the world economy, it is necessary and responsible for the three sides to further strengthen communication, enhance mutual trust, deepen cooperation, and provide more stabilising factors for regional peace and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  First, Wang said, they agreed to consolidate the momentum of cooperation. The three countries will stay true to the original aspiration of cooperation, focus on the Trilateral Cooperation Vision for the Next Decade, and expand new areas, cultivate new growth drivers, and create new highlights of cooperation on the basis of implementing the cooperation centred on six key areas determined by the leaders' meeting last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three parties had useful communication on holding the 10th China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Summit this year, and will strive to create favourable conditions and atmosphere for this purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second, they agreed to promote regional economic integration. The three countries will continue to communicate on restarting the negotiations on the trilateral free trade agreement, promoting the expansion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and maintaining the stability and smoothness of regional production and supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three countries will keep pace with the times to build a highland of scientific and technological innovation in Asia and promote the development of new quality productive forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third, they agreed to deepen exchanges and mutual learning. The three countries will hold the China-Japan-ROK Year of Cultural Exchange from 2025 to 2026, strive to increase the number of people-to-people exchanges among the three countries to 40 million by 2030, and consolidate the public opinion basis for trilateral cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strengthening cooperation in social welfare, green and low-carbon development and other fields can bring more and better benefits to the people of the three countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth, they agreed to enhance multilateral cooperation. The three countries will strengthen coordination and cooperation under mechanisms such as ASEAN Plus Three and the East Asia Summit, promote "Trilateral+X Cooperation" to the surrounding areas, and drive common development in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will support each other in hosting Apec meetings, promote open regionalism, uphold multilateralism and free trade, and push for more universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that the three countries fully affirmed the work of the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat, and agreed to extend the term of the Secretariat's consultative committee, looking forward to the Secretariat playing a greater role in promoting trilateral cooperation. (Xinhua)

    French film star Depardieu to go on trial next week

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French actor Gerard Depardieu faces trial on Monday over alleged sexual assaults of two women on a film set, a case placing one of the world's best known movie stars at the heart of France's broader reckoning over sexual violence.
 <br>
  <br>
  A towering figure of French cinema, Depardieu has faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations in recent years. Depardieu, 76, has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and this would be the first case for which he would be standing trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu's lawyer, Jeremie Assous, said the case was based on "false accusations" against his client, adding that the movie star was expected to attend the two-day trial after an initial hearing was postponed due to his ill health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors say the assaults took place during the filming in 2021 of "Les Volets Verts" (The Green Shutters).
  <br>
  <br>
  They accuse Depardieu of groping one of the women on the film set, pulling her towards him and trapping her with his legs before touching her waist, hips and breasts while saying obscene words. Three people witnessed the scene, prosecutors say.
  <br>
  <br>
  They say the second woman was groped by Depardieu on set and in the street.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's identities have not been revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alleged assaults occurred while Depardieu was under formal investigation over accusations of raping a young actress in 2018. A trial has been requested by prosecutors in the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for one of the women said her client was scared to come forward against Depardieu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a fear, because he's a cinema giant," said Carine Durrieu-Diebolt. "It's a struggle between David and Goliath and they are afraid of retaliation as they all work in cinema but at a much lower level than Depardieu."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawyer for the second plaintiff did not reply to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu's trial could be the highest-profile #MeToo case to come before the courts in France, a country where the protest movement over sexual violence has struggled to gain the same traction as in the United States. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump announced on Friday that Boeing has been awarded the contract for the Air Force's next-generation stealth fighter plane, which the 47th US president said would be named the F-47.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Nothing in the world comes even close to it, and it'll be known as the F-47. The generals picked a title, and it's a beautiful number, F-47," said Trump at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The contract aims to develop the replacement for the F-22 jet, which has been in operation for some two decades, with a new, more advanced aircraft able to operate alongside uncrewed drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America's top aerospace companies, the Air Force is going to be awarding the contract for the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform to Boeing," Trump said in televised remarks in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the price of the contract could not be revealed for security reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, speaking alongside Trump, said the new aircraft "sends a very direct, clear message to our allies that we're not going anywhere and to our enemies that... we will be able to project power around the globe unimpeded for generations to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement is a boon for Boeing, which faced a difficult last year in which it struggled with a lengthy labour strike and safety problems on its civilian airliners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NGAD effort was paused in 2024 over cost concerns, a major focus of the Trump administration, which has tasked billionaire donor Elon Musk with slashing government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018 that the NGAD airframe could cost up to US$300 million apiece—significantly more than various other aircraft currently in the US inventory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, "officials cast doubt on whether the Air Force could afford to develop the NGAD alongside programs including the B-21 Raider bomber and the Minuteman III ICBM replacement," the Congressional Research Service said in a report earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The F-47 will replace the F-22 Raptor, which features stealth technology, a high degree of manoeuvrability, and the ability to supercruise, or maintain supersonic flight without afterburners. (AFP)

<img alt="The joint appeal came after Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened Friday to annex parts of the Gaza Strip. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796887_1_20250322075550.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain called late on Friday for an "immediate return" to a Gaza ceasefire, as Israel's military pressed its renewed offensive in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel on Tuesday began a fresh assault on the war-battered enclave, shattering the relative calm since a January 19 ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of Israeli strikes in Gaza marks a dramatic step backward for the people of Gaza. We are appalled by the civilian casualties and urgently call for an immediate return to a ceasefire," the ministers said in a joint statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint appeal came after Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened Friday to annex parts of the Gaza Strip if Hamas did not release the remaining Israeli hostages being held there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministers -- Germany's Annalena Baerbock, France's Jean-Noel Barrot and Britain's David Lammy -- called on "all parties to re-engage with negotiations to ensure the ceasefire is implemented in full and becomes permanent".
  <br>
  <br>
  They said Hamas must release the dozens of hostages remaining in the Palestinian territory and that the group "must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel anymore".
  <br>
  <br>
  The allies said Israel must "fully respect international law" and allow the flow of aid into the territory. (AFP)

    Flights at London Heathrow resume after power outage

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Flights at Britain's Heathrow resumed late on Friday after a fire knocked out its power supply and shut Europe's busiest airport for the day, stranding tens of thousands of passengers and causing travel turmoil worldwide.
 <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow said its teams worked tirelessly to reopen the world's fifth-busiest airport after it was forced to close entirely after a huge fire engulfed a nearby substation on Thursday night, with travellers told to stay away.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airport had been due to handle 1,351 flights on Friday, flying up to 291,000 passengers, but planes were diverted to other airports in Britain and across Europe, while many long-haul flights returned to their point of departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow said there would be a limited number of flights on Friday, mostly focused on relocating aircraft and bringing planes into London.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow morning, we expect to be back in full operation, to 100 percent operation as a normal day," said Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye. "What I'd like to do is to apologise to the many people who have had their travel affected ... we are very sorry about all the inconvenience."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said that after an initial assessment they were not treating the incident as suspicious, although enquiries remained ongoing. London Fire Brigade said its investigations would focus on the electrical distribution equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The closure not only caused misery for travellers but provoked anger from airlines, which questioned how such crucial infrastructure could fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The industry is now facing the prospect of a financial hit costing tens of millions of pounds, and a likely fight over who should pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You would think they would have significant back-up power," one top executive from a European airline told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow's Woldbye said back-up systems and procedures had worked as they should.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This (power supply) is a bit of a weak point," he told reporters outside the airport. "But of course contingencies of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100% and this is one of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked who would pay, he said there were "procedures in place", adding "we don't have liabilities in place for incidents like this".
  <br>
  <br>
  British transport minister Heidi Alexander said the incident had been out of Heathrow's control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have stood up their resilience plans very swiftly and have been working in close collaboration with all the emergency responders and the airline operators," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airlines including JetBlue, American Airlines, Air Canada, Air India, Delta Air Lines, Qantas, United Airlines, IAG-owned British Airways and Virgin were diverted or returned to their origin airports in the middle of the night, according to data from flight analytics firm Cirium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in many airlines, including US carriers, fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aviation experts said the last time European airports experienced disruption on such a large scale was the 2010 Icelandic volcanic ash cloud that grounded some 100,000 flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  While flights are restarting, it will be some time before all scheduled passenger services return to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have flight and cabin crew colleagues and planes that are currently at locations where we weren’t planning on them to be," said Sean Doyle, chief executive of British Airways, the biggest carrier at Heathrow which had 341 flights scheduled to land there on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, it will have a huge impact on all of our customers flying with us over the coming days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Department for Transport said it had temporarily lifted restrictions on overnight flights to ease congestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers stranded in London and facing the prospect of days of disruptions were scrambling to make alternate travel arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty stressful," Robyn Autry, 39, a professor, who had been due to fly home to New York. "I'm worried about how much is it going to cost me to fix this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Prices at hotels around Heathrow jumped, with booking sites offering rooms for 500 pounds (US$645), roughly five times the normal price levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airline executives, electrical engineers and passengers questioned how Britain's gateway to the world could be forced to close by one fire, however large.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow and London's other major airports have been hit by other outages in recent years, most recently by an automated gate failure and an air traffic system meltdown, both in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philip Ingram, a former intelligence officer in the British military, said Heathrow's inability to keep operating exposed vulnerability in Britain's critical national infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a wake-up call," he told Reuters. "There is no way that Heathrow should be taken out completely because of a failure in one power substation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Willie Walsh, the head of the global airlines body IATA and a former head of British Airways, said Heathrow had once again let passengers down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow said it had diesel generators and uninterruptible power supplies in place to land aircraft and evacuate passengers safely. Those systems all operated as expected. But with the airport consuming as much energy as a small city, it said it could not run all its operations safely on back-up systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson said there were questions to answer about how the incident occurred and there would be a thorough investigation. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Counter-terror police on Friday launched a probe into an electricity substation fire that shut down Heathrow airport causing travel chaos for passengers around the world and the cancellation or diversion of hundreds of flights from Europe's busiest air hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow plies routes to around 80 countries and some 1,350 flights had been due to land or take off from the airport's five terminals on Friday, according to the online flight tracking website Flightradar24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 230,000 passengers a day and 83 million a year use Heathrow, making it one of the world's busiest airports.
  <br>
  <br>
  London's Metropolitan Police said the force's Counter Terrorism Command was leading enquiries given the "impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "While there is currently no indication of foul play we retain an open mind at this time," a spokesman added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters were called to the "highly visible" blaze at the substation shortly after 2320 GMT on Thursday and around 70 were sent to battle the fire, which was brought under control by 0800 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses saw water cannons were still being used at the smoking fire site at around 1300 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband promised that the government would do all it could to restore power to Heathrow quickly, as questions were raised about the airport's "resilience."
  <br>
  <br>
  The shutdown left many frustrated passengers struggling to make alternative arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced, according to Flightradar24.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK's second busiest airport, Gatwick, said it would accept some flights from Heathrow. Others were diverted to European airports including Shannon in southwestern Ireland, Frankfurt, and Paris Charles de Gaulle.
  <br>
  <br>
  London Fire Brigade deputy commissioner Jonathan Smith said firefighters had worked "tirelessly in challenging and very hazardous conditions."
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters the fire had involved a "transformer comprising of 25,000 litres of cooling oil fully alight" posing a hazard due to the substation's "still live high voltage equipment."
  <br>
  <br>
  One resident near the substation recalled hearing a "massive explosion" as the power cut out just before midnight while another reported seeing a "bright flash of white."
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 150 people were evacuated from nearby properties because of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outage left 100,000 homes without power overnight. By morning, power had been restored to all but around 4,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the scale of the disruption began to emerge, Miliband faced questions about how one fire could shut down an entire airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the electricity distribution network National Grid had told him they had not seen "anything like the scale" of what happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it makes Heathrow look quite vulnerable and therefore we've got to learn lessons, as I say, about not just Heathrow but how we protect our major infrastructure," he told ITV News.
  <br>
  <br>
  Willie Walsh, director general of the airline industry trade association IATA, said the closure was "yet another case of Heathrow letting down both travellers and airlines."
  <br>
  <br>
  "How is it that critical infrastructure – of national and global importance – is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case – as it seems – then it is a clear planning failure by the airport," he said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flights from all over the world were affected by the closure and aviation consultant Philip Butterworth-Hayes said it would cost "more than £50 million (US$64.7 million)" to the airport and airlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Situated 25 kilometres west of central London, Heathrow's main flight destinations last year were Dublin, Los Angeles, Madrid and New York. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year was the deadliest year for migrants, with nearly 9,000 people dying worldwide, the United Nations said on Friday, calling the "tragedy... unacceptable and preventable".
 <br>
  <br>
  "At least 8,938 people died on migration routes worldwide in 2024," the fifth year that numbers have reached record highs, the UN's migration agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tragedy of the growing number of migrant deaths worldwide is both unacceptable and preventable," said Ugochi Daniels, the deputy director of the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
  <br>
  <br>
  "Behind every number is a human being, someone for whom the loss is devastating," Daniels said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The actual number of migrant deaths and disappearances is likely much higher, as many have gone undocumented because of the dearth of official sources," the IOM said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the identities and other details of the majority of victims were unknown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asia, Africa and Europe had record numbers of people dying in 2024 with 2,778, 2,242 and 233 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 2,452 people were recorded as dying in the Mediterranean Sea, the main gateway for those trying to reach Europe, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Final data were not available yet for the Americas but figures so far show at least 1,233 people died.
  <br>
  <br>
  These included "an unprecedented 341 lives lost in the Caribbean in 2024 and a record 174 deaths of migrants crossing the Darien" jungle between Colombia and Panama.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Darien jungle was at one point the main migratory corridor for people trying to reach the United States. (AFP)

    NJZ loses court fight to leave label

<img alt="The Seoul Central District Court prohibits members of NJZ from pursuing independent endeavours. File photo: NewJeans" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796797_1_20250321161623.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court on Friday ruled against popular K-pop girl group NewJeans, which had sought to sever ties with their label ADOR over what they called "mistreatment" by the company.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group, which now calls themselves NJZ and is to appear in Hong Kong's ComplexCon this weekend, made headlines in November by announcing their decision to leave ADOR, whose parent company HYBE is behind K-pop sensation BTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  The label later filed for an injunction to maintain its status as the managing agency of NewJeans, requesting that the Seoul Central District Court prohibit the group's members from engaging in independent commercial activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court sided with ADOR, issuing a ruling that the group, now branding themselves as NJZ, must not pursue independent endeavours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said that if the group "unilaterally terminate their exclusive contract" with ADOR, and change their name autonomously, the label would suffer "significant damages".
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's actions would also "severely damage not only the brand value of NewJeans but also ADOR's reputation as a management company," the court added.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans made their debut in 2022 and the K-pop phenomenon is among HYBE's most successful acts.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans and ADOR have been caught in the heated contract dispute since August, following allegations that HYBE forced out the group's star producer, Min Hee-jin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The band issued an ultimatum for Min's reinstatement, which HYBE declined.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the members took their grievances public, accusing the label of intentionally sabotaging their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Band member Hanni alleged last year that the group experienced workplace harassment, such as "deliberate miscommunications and manipulation regarding multiple areas" while working with ADOR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the type of work ethic we respect and not one we want to be a part of, and to continue working under a company with no intention of protecting NewJeans would only do us harm," she said at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the court on Friday said that based on the claims and evidence submitted by the group, it is "difficult to conclude that ADOR has sufficiently violated the essential obligations of the exclusive contract."
  <br>
  <br>
  ADOR welcomed the court's "judicious" decision, and said they "eagerly anticipate meeting with the artists for a heartfelt conversation at the earliest opportunity".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With our status as NewJeans' exclusive agency now legally affirmed, we are fully committed to supporting the artists going forward," it said. (With additional reporting from AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin's top security adviser Sergei Shoigu has arrived in North Korea and plans to meet its leader Kim Jong-un, the Tass news agency reported on Friday, his latest visit amid dramatic advances in security ties between the countries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Tass report did not have further details and North Korea's state media have not reported on Shoigu's arrival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shoigu, former defence minister until May last year, had earlier made visits to Pyongyang as North Korea geared up to deploy troops to fight for Russia in its war against Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and South Korean officials have said North Korea has deployed more than 10,000 troops who were sent into combat in Russia's eastern Kursk region and also shipped heavy weapons including artillery and ballistic missiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea is believed to have received military and civilian technology and economic assistance from Moscow in return.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Pyongyang nor Moscow has acknowledged Pyongyang's deployment of troops and weapons, but said they had continued to implement a strategic partnership treaty signed by the countries' leaders in June last year that includes a mutual defence pact. (Reuters)

    London's Heathrow airport closes due to power outage

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Heathrow Airport on Friday said it would be closed until midnight after experiencing a significant power outage due to a fire at a nearby electrical substation supplying the airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  "To maintain the safety of our passengers and colleagues, Heathrow will be closed until 23h59 on 21 March," Heathrow Airport said in a post on X, adding that passengers are advised not to travel to the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no clarity on when power may be reliably restored, a Heathrow spokesperson told Reuters in an email, and added they expect significant disruption over the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eurocontrol, which manages air traffic control operations across Europe, said on its operations website that no arrivals were being allowed at Heathrow due to the power outage and there were diversion plans in place for flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, some diversions to other airports were already occurring, with Qantas Airways sending its flight from Perth to Paris and a United Airlines New York flight heading to Shannon, Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  A United Airlines flight from San Francisco was due to land in Washington, DC rather than London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow was the world's second-busiest international airport in 2024 behind Dubai, according to travel data firm OAG.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London Fire Brigade said its crews were tackling the fire in Hayes in west London and had evacuated around 150 people from the area as a precaution. (Reuters)

    N Korea tests new anti-aircraft system

<img alt="Kim Jong-un visits the Nampho Dockyard on Thursday in Nampho, North Korea. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796741_1_20250321110412.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea test-fired its latest anti-aircraft missile system in a drill watched by leader Kim Jong-un, state media reported on Friday, as the nuclear-armed state lashed out at US-South Korea joint drills.
 <br>
  <br>
  The launch proved the system's "combat fast response," the Korean Central News Agency said, and came a day after South Korea wrapped up a major annual joint military exercise with the United States, known as Freedom Shield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim praised the latest anti-aircraft system, saying North Korea's army would be "equipped with another major defence weapon system with laudable combat performance," the news agency wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not specify where the test took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul said last week the North fired "multiple unidentified ballistic missiles" after it began the joint drills involving US soldiers stationed in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement on Thursday, an official for the North's defence ministry denounced the military exercise as "no more than a rehearsal of war of aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pyongyang also carried out a test-launch of strategic cruise missiles in the Yellow Sea in late February, which it said showed off "counterattack capabilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The most recent Freedom Shield exercise featured a collaborative drill focused on countering weapons of mass destruction, specifically targeting nuclear, chemical, biological, and radioactive threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of UN sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and Western intelligence agencies have said that more than 10,000 soldiers from the reclusive North were sent to Russia last year to help it fight a shock Ukrainian offensive into the Kursk border region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's spy agency said last month that the North has sent more soldiers to Russia and re-deployed several to the frontline in Kursk.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report by Seoul's defence ministry said the North was "continuing to provide weapons, ammunition and other military support to Russia following its troop deployment in the Ukraine war". (AFP)

    Shin Bet boss axed as Netanyahu split comes to a head

<img alt="Ronen Bar says his sacking is intended to 'prevent investigations into the events leading up to October 7' attack. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796737_1_20250321102045.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, was sacked on Friday, days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he no longer trusts him, and fallout from a report on the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The government unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to end ISA Director Ronen Bar's term of office," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will leave his post when his successor is appointed or by April 10 at the latest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu on Sunday cited an "ongoing lack of trust" as the reason for moving to dismiss Bar, who joined the agency in 1993.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar, meant to end his tenure next year, was appointed Shin Bet chief in October 2021 by the previous Israeli government that briefly forced Netanyahu from power between June 2021 and December 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  His relations with Netanyahu were strained even before the unprecedented October Hamas attack which sparked the war in Gaza, notably over proposed judicial reforms that had split the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations worsened after the March 4 release of the internal Shin Bet report on the Hamas attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  It acknowledged the agency's own failure in preventing the attack, but also said "a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup".
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar had already hinted that he would resign before the end of his term, taking responsibility for his agency's failure to prevent the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar's dismissal provoked the anger of the opposition and led to demonstrations accusing Netanyahu of threatening democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several thousand people braved bad weather late on Thursday to demonstrate outside Netanyahu's private residence in Jerusalem and then the Israeli parliament, where ministers were meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a letter made public on Thursday, Bar said Netanyahu's arguments were "general, unsubstantiated accusations that seem to hide the motivations behind the decision to terminate [his] duties".
  <br>
  <br>
  He wrote the real motives were based on "personal interest" and intended to "prevent investigations into the events leading up to October 7 and other serious matters" being looked at by the Shin Bet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He referred to the "complex, wide-ranging and highly sensitive investigation" involving people close to Netanyahu who allegedly received money from Qatar, a case dubbed "Qatargate" by the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar's dismissal comes after the Israeli army launched a series of massive and deadly bombardments on the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, following a two-month truce and "targeted" ground operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said the operations were intended to put pressure on Hamas to release the 58 hostages remaining in the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rare criticism of Netanyahu, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on Thursday that he was worried the resumption of strikes in a time of crisis could undermine "national resilience." (AFP)

    'Coalition of willing' to meet next week on Ukraine

<img alt="French President Emmanuel Macron announced the new meeting after a European Union summit in Brussels. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796727_1_20250321094059.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron said leaders of the coalition backing Ukraine would meet again next week, hoping to finalise plans to secure a potential truce in the war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The huddle in Paris with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be the latest in a series of high-stakes gatherings and will come after Kyiv and Moscow hold talks in Saudi Arabia with the United States on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron's announcement on Thursday came after London played host to the latest discussions of military top brass from the so-called "coalition of the willing" around Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said plans on policing a possible ceasefire were "coming together" as US President Donald Trump forges ahead with Russia on ending its war on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron - who along with Starmer has said he is willing to deploy troops to Ukraine - said the meeting next Thursday will be a chance to "fine-tune" work on ensuring any truce is durable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Zelensky told an EU summit that "nothing had changed" as Moscow has kept up bombardments despite agreeing with Trump to halt strikes on Ukraine's energy system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said Russian President Vladimir Putin must "stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war", calling on the EU to ramp up arms deliveries and keep sanctions in force.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU leaders vowed in a joint declaration, which was agreed without the support of Russia-friendly Hungary, to step up military support despite Moscow's demands for foreign support to stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they stopped short of endorsing a request from Zelensky to give Kyiv US$5.4 billion for artillery shells, in the face of opposition from France and Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Norway, Zelensky said Ukrainian and US officials would meet in Saudi Arabia on Monday to build on US-led efforts to secure an end to the war with Russian, now grinding into its fourth year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin had earlier confirmed Russian officials would also hold talks with the US side in Saudi Arabia on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky and Putin both held talks with Trump this week, and have indicated they are prepared to halt attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days. (AFP)

    World's glacier mass shrank again in 2024, says UN

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 All 19 of the world's glacier regions experienced a net loss of mass in 2024 for the third consecutive year, the United Nations said on Friday, warning that saving the planet's glaciers was now a matter of "survival".
 <br>
  <br>
  Five of the last six years have seen the most rapid glacier retreat on record, the UN's World Meteorological Organization weather, climate and water agency said, on the inaugural World Day for Glaciers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preservation of glaciers is not just an environmental, economic and societal necessity: it's a matter of survival," said WMO chief Celeste Saulo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond the continental ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, more than 275,000 glaciers worldwide cover approximately 700,000 square kilometres, said the WMO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they are rapidly shrinking due to climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 hydrological year marked the third year in a row in which all 19 glacier regions experienced a net mass loss," the WMO added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together, they lost 450 billion tonnes of mass, the agency said, citing new data from the Swiss-based World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS).
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the fourth worst year on record, with the worst being in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  At current rates of melting, many glaciers in western Canada and the United States, Scandinavia, central Europe, the Caucasus, and New Zealand "will not survive the 21st century", said the WMO.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said that together with ice sheets, glaciers store around 70 percent of the world's freshwater resources, with high mountain regions acting like the world's water towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  If they disappear, that would threaten water supplies for millions of people downstream. (AFP)

    China calls for protections for students in US

<img alt="Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning urged the US not to impose discriminatory restrictive measures on Chinese students. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796721_1_20250321092239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday demanded protections for Chinese students in the US after a congressional panel asked six American universities to hand over a large amount of detailed information on their students, citing national security concerns.
 <br>
  <br>
  A letter sent to the universities, including Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, alleged that the Chinese government was embedding researchers in top American institutions to gain direct access to sensitive technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Chinese students account for about one-quarter of all international students in the US and that their activities have promoted “the economic prosperity and technological development of the US.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is in the interest of both parties," Mao told reporters at a daily briefing. "We urge the US to stop overstretching the concept of national security, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students, and not impose discriminatory restrictive measures on Chinese students.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Her remarks came a day after John Moolenaar, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to six colleges requesting information on Chinese students enrolled in advanced science and technology programs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The colleges named in Moolenaar's letter were Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the University of Maryland, and the University of Southern California.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described America’s student visa system as a Trojan horse for Beijing, providing unrestricted access to the country's top research institutions and posing a direct threat to national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The letter requested information including the Chinese students' sources of funding, the types of research they're involved in, what schools they previously attended, and “a country-by-country breakdown of applicants, admittances, and enrolments at your university.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, a Republican lawmaker introduced a bill seeking to ban Chinese students from studying in US schools. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aimed at shutting down the Department of Education, a decades-old goal of the American right, which wants individual states to run schools free from the influence of federal government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Surrounded by schoolchildren sitting at desks set up in the East Room of the White House, Trump smiled as held up the order after signing it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the order would "begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible. It's doing us no good," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to return education back to the states where it belongs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Department, created in 1979, cannot be shuttered without the approval of Congress, but Trump's order will likely have the power to starve it of funds and staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is one of the most drastic steps yet in the brutal overhaul of the government that Trump is carrying out with the help of tech tycoon Elon Musk and his Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats and educators have slammed the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, called it a "tyrannical power grab" and "one of the most destructive and devastating steps Donald Trump has ever taken."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has cast the move as necessary to save money and improve educational standards in the United States, saying they are lagging behind those in Europe and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But education has been a battleground for decades in America's culture wars, and Republicans have long wanted to remove control of it from the federal government. (AFP)

 Tesla was removed from the Vancouver International Auto Show in Canada because of safety concerns, the event organisers said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla as a participant in this week's event, after the automaker was provided multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw," Eric Nicholl, executive director for the auto show said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The safety concerns come as protesters across the United States stage demonstrations targeting Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who is spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency's move to shrink the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Vancouver Auto Show's primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors, and staff," Nicholl said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toronto on Monday stopped providing financial incentives for Tesla vehicles purchased as taxis or ride shares due to escalating trade tensions between Canada and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's mayor said that the decision was meant to target Musk, a close adviser to the US president. Trump has called for Canada's annexation and imposed tariffs on Canadian products, angering Canadians. (Reuters)

    Oxygen detected in most distant galaxy: astronomers

<img alt="Dutch and Italian astronomers probed the JADES-GS-z14-0 galaxy using the ALMA radio telescope in Chile's Atacama desert. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796693_1_20250321032017.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oxygen has been detected in the most distant galaxy ever discovered, surprised astronomers said on Thursday, offering further evidence that stars in the early universe matured far quicker than had been thought possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  The galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0, which was discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope last year, is so far away that its light took 13.4 billion years to reach Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  This means the galaxy can also reveal what the universe was like in its infancy, when it was just 300 million years old – two percent of its current age.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since coming online in 2022, the powerful Webb telescope has discovered that galaxies in the young universe were much brighter, more advanced and more numerous than scientists had expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  These discoveries have been so startling they have raised doubts about whether something important is missing in our understanding of the universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the latest research, two international teams led by Dutch and Italian astronomers probed the JADES-GS-z14-0 galaxy using the ALMA radio telescope in Chile's Atacama desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  They detected traces of oxygen, according to the European Southern Observatory, confirming hints previously spotted by the Webb telescope.
  <br>
  <br>
  During this period known as the cosmic dawn, newly born galaxies were thought to only have young stars, which mostly contain light elements like hydrogen and helium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only later were they supposed to get heavier stuff such as oxygen.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the two new studies found that JADES-GS-z14-0 has around 10 times more heavy elements than had been anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is like finding an adolescent where you would only expect babies," said Sander Schouws of Leiden Observatory, the first author of a Dutch-led study to be published in The Astrophysical Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The results show the galaxy has formed very rapidly and is also maturing rapidly, adding to a growing body of evidence that the formation of galaxies happens much faster than was expected," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Astrophysicist Stefano Carniani, lead author of the Italian-led paper to be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, said he was "astonished by the unexpected results."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The evidence that a galaxy is already mature in the infant universe raises questions about when and how galaxies formed." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States fell to its lowest happiness ranking ever partly due to a rise in the number of Americans eating their meals alone, an annual UN-sponsored report said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Finland ranked as the world's happiest country for the eighth straight year in the World Happiness Report, with locals and experts thanking its grand lakes and strong welfare system for boosting its mood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan, plagued by a humanitarian catastrophe since the Taliban regained control in 2020, once again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States fell to 24th place, its lowest score since the report was first published in 2012, when it recorded its highest showing at number 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53 percent over the past two decades," the authors said, noting that sharing meals "is strongly linked with well-being."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, roughly one in four Americans reported eating all their meals alone the previous day, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increasing number of people who eat alone is one reason for declining well-being in the United States," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also noted that the United States was one of few countries to see a rise of so-called "deaths of despair" – from suicide or substance abuse – at a time when those deaths are declining in a majority of countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report surveyed people worldwide in 2022-2024, before US President Donald Trump's shakeup of national and global affairs since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nordic countries all stayed among the 10 happiest, with Denmark, Iceland and Sweden trailing Finland, which slightly extended its lead over runner-up Denmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, at the sixth and 10th spot respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The happiness ranking is based on a three-year average of individuals' self-assessed evaluations of life satisfaction, as well as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity and corruption. (AFP)

    White House promises 'big tariffs' on April 2

<img alt='White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says America "has been ripped off by every country around the world." Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796689_1_20250321011627.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House on Thursday vowed to impose "big tariffs" on April 2 when US President Donald Trump is to unveil reciprocal levies in a major escalation of his trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's comments came days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Washington is expected to present other countries with a number representing their tariff and other barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent's remarks had suggested a possible delay in the activation of some duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leavitt told reporters that Trump has been "very clear about his intention for April 2."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big announcements when it comes to reciprocal trade," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the president will be highlighting the unfair trade practices, the ways in which America has been ripped off by every country around the world, quite frankly."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big tariffs that will be going into effect," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised reciprocal duties on both US allies and competitors from April 2, although the exact details of this plan have yet to be released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent had told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo that on the day, "each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said at the time that some duties may not have to go on as a deal "is pre-negotiated," or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said it fired rockets at Israeli commercial hub Tel Aviv on Thursday in its first military response to the growing civilian death toll from Israel's resumption of air and ground operations in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel said it had closed off the territory's main north-south route as troops expanded the ground operations they resumed on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said 504 people had been killed so far in the Israeli assault this week, including more than 190 children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it fired rockets at Tel Aviv in response to Israel's "massacres" of Gaza civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army said it intercepted one projectile fired from Gaza and that two others struck an uninhabited area.
  <br>
  <br>
  After weeks of stalemate, Israel resumed its air campaign early on Tuesday with a wave of deadly strikes that drew widespread condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The offensive shattered a relative calm that had pervaded the war-ravaged Palestinian territory since a ceasefire took hold on January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump "fully supports" Israel's deadly resumption of air and ground operations in Gaza, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday when asked if he was trying to get a Gaza ceasefire back on track. (AFP)

    Zelensky, EU leaders discuss support for Ukraine

<img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was set to address the summit by video link. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796668_1_20250320205411.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas urged EU leaders on Thursday to pledge 5 billion euros for artillery shells for Ukraine to strengthen its hand in peace talks, amid divergences over how to bolster Kyiv and the EU's own military capabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arriving at an EU summit in Brussels, Kallas called on leaders to match words of support for Kyiv with deeds, as US President Donald Trump pushes ahead with his efforts to end the war, including through a rapprochement with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kallas has scaled back a proposal to pledge up to 40 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine this year, with each country contributing according to its economic size, after resistance from some countries, particularly in southern Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  She told reporters she was now focusing on what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy – who was to address the summit by video link – says he needs most urgently, such as 2 million artillery shells at a cost of 5 billion euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should at least start to have a really concrete step – not only in words, but also in deeds that we are helping Ukraine right now. Because the stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiating table," Kallas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstering the EU's own defences also features on the summit agenda, reflecting deep fears that Moscow may attack an EU member in the coming years and doubts about the future of US protection for Europe via the Nato defence alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuania's President Gitanas Nauseda reiterated his support to Kyiv on Thursday, saying "Ukraine needs our military assistance. Ukraine needs long-range missiles and we are ready to provide it. We should increase the pressure on Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to rearm ourselves because otherwise we will be the next victims of Russian aggression," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But some southern European capitals have been more reticent, reflecting a division between those geographically closer to Russia that have given more aid to Ukraine and those further away that have given less, as a share of their economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he did not like the term "rearm", which the European Commission has used extensively in its push for more defence spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to take into account that the challenges that we face in the southern neighbourhood are a bit different to the ones that the eastern flank faces," he said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Thursday it acted in accordance with the law over the execution of four Canadian citizens in recent weeks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in Ottawa on Wednesday that China had executed four Canadian citizens in recent weeks, defying pleas from Ottawa for leniency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly condemn the executions that did happen against Canadians in China," Joly said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she was unable to discuss details of the case due to privacy requests from the families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing suggested on Thursday the Canadians had been convicted over narcotics offences, saying "... combating drug crimes is the common responsibility of all countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is a country under the rule of law," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing, she said, "treats defendants of different nationalities equally without discrimination" and "handles cases fairly in strict accordance with the law."
  <br>
  <br>
  China "protects the legitimate rights of the parties concerned as well as the consular rights of the Canadian side, in accordance with the law," Mao added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing also defended the executions in a statement sent to Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Drug-related crime is a severe crime recognised worldwide as extremely harmful to the society," the embassy statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a 'zero tolerance' attitude towards the drug problem." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Formula 1 team owner and media personality Eddie Jordan has died, according to his family. He was 76.
 <br>
  <br>
  He ran his own Jordan team in the 1990s and 2000s in F1 and became a popular pundit on TV after selling the team in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan had been undergoing treatment for what he had called “quite aggressive” cancer of the bladder and prostate, which spread to his spine and pelvis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The family said in a statement Jordan “passed away peacefully with family by his side in Cape Town” early on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “EJ brought an abundance of charisma, energy and Irish charm everywhere he went. We all have a huge hole missing without his presence. He will be missed by so many people, but he leaves us with tonnes of great memories to keep us smiling through our sorrow.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish businessman Jordan operated his own racing team in lower-level series before moving up to F1 in 1991, giving future seven-time champion Michael Schumacher his first race that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other drivers over the years included Damon Hill, who won the 1996 championship with Williams, future Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who was third in the championship for Jordan in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Grand Prix won four races before Jordan sold the team in 2005. Following more sales and name changes since then, the team competes as Aston Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 76-year-old Jordan also acted as the manager for car design great Adrian Newey when he left Red Bull for Aston Martin last year. (AP)

    Malaysia gives green light for new MH370 search

<img alt="Relatives of passengers on board the missing MH370 leave after taking part in a demonstration outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing on the 11th anniversary of the flight’s disappearance. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796601_1_20250320142559.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia’s government has given final approval for a Texas-based marine robotics company to renew the search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean more than a decade ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cabinet ministers agreed to terms and conditions for a “no-find, no-fee” contract with Texas-based Ocean Infinity to resume the seabed search operation at a new 15,000-square-kilometre site in the ocean, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said. Ocean Infinity will be paid US$70 million only if it discovers the wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 plane vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, on a flight from Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing. Satellite data showed the plane turned from its flight path and headed south to the far-southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed .
  <br>
  <br>
  An expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues to its location, although debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands. A private search in 2018 by Ocean Infinity also found nothing .
  <br>
  <br>
  The final approval for a new search came three months after Malaysia gave the nod in principle to plans for a fresh search.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity chief executive Oliver Punkett reportedly said this year the company had improved its technology since 2018. He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyse data and had narrowed the search area to the most likely site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said his ministry will ink a contract with Ocean Infinity soon. The firm has reportedly sent a search vessel to the site and indicated that January-April is the best period for the search.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the passengers of flight MH370,” he said. (AP)

    Indonesia passes controversial military law revisions

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia's parliament on Thursday passed contentious revisions to the country's military law, which will allocate more civilian posts for military officers, and street protests against the changes are expected to take place.
 <br>
  <br>
  The revisions have been criticised by civil society groups, who say it could take the world's third-biggest democracy back to the draconian 'New Order' era of former strongman president Suharto, when military officers dominated civilian affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaker Puan Maharani led the unanimous vote in a plenary council and officially passed the law, saying that it was in accordance with the principle of democracy and human rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Prabowo Subianto, who took office in October and was a special forces commander under Suharto, has been expanding the armed forces' role into what were considered civilian areas, including his flagship programme of free meals for children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups have criticised the increased military involvement because they fear it may lead to abuses of power, human rights violations and impunity from consequences for actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said the bill requires officers to resign from the military before assuming civilian posts at departments such as the Attorney's General Office and a a lawmaker has said officers could not join state-owned companies, to counter concerns the military would be involved in business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters from several democracy groups and students have said they will stage rallies in front of the parliamentary building in Jakarta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some students had camped at the back gate of parliamentary building since Wednesday evening, protesting the law and demanding the government pull out all military personnel from civilian jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police officers forced them to leave the building but they refused, one protestor said. There were just a few dozen protesters at the time the bill was passed by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Military personnel were called in for security in the parliamentary building to assist police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The geopolitical changes and global military technology require the military to transform... to face conventional and non conventional conflicts," Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin told parliament, while defending the revised law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will never disappoint the Indonesians in keeping our sovereignty," he added, but did not specify what geopolitical challenges he was referring to. (Reuters)

    Canadian farmers fear 'devastating tariffs impact'

<img alt="China has traditionally been one of Canada's biggest export markets for canola, grown on farms in such places as Alberta. File photo: Artur Widak/AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796564_1_20250320112443.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tariffs on Canadian products including rapeseed oil and pork come into effect on Thursday, with an industry lobby warning the new levies will have a "devastating impact" on farmers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs, announced this month, follow a Beijing probe into levies imposed by Ottawa on Chinese goods last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  They hit rapeseed oil, oil cakes, and peas imported from Canada with a 100 percent surcharge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada is among the world's top producers of canola, a rapeseed crop that is used to make cooking oil, animal feed and biodiesel fuel, and China has historically been one of its largest customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aquatic products and pork, meanwhile, will face a 25 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian industry leaders have warned they would be hit hard by the fresh tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "New tariffs from China on Canadian canola oil and meal will have a devastating impact on canola farmers and the broader value chain at a time of increased trade and geopolitical uncertainty," said Canola Council of Canada president Chris Davison.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the federal government to immediately engage with China, with a view to resolving this issue," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fresh tariffs come as both Canada and China face deepening trade tensions with the US, which under President Donald Trump has rolled out stiff new tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ottawa in August placed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, matching US measures seeking to fend off the import of Chinese cars into North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also announced a surcharge on imports of steel and aluminum products from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's commerce ministry said a probe into these measures found that Canadian policies "disrupted the normal trade order and harmed the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises".
  <br>
  <br>
  In Beijing, some residents said they were supportive of China's tariffs on goods from other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has become strong and doesn't need to rely on others for everything," said Zheng Ruitao, a Beijing resident in his thirties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me personally, it has not much impact, the impact might be on the country," said Song Qing, another Beijing resident. (AFP)

    Trump urges Fed to cut rates as tariffs take effect

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump urged the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday to cut interest rates to help offset effects of his tariffs, renewing his vocal disagreement with the central bank's decision-making.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Do the right thing," Trump demanded in a Wednesday night post on his Truth Social site, hours after the Fed decided to hold rates steady, while reducing its growth forecast and hiking its inflation outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve has pencilled in two rate cuts this year, but chairman Jerome Powell noted that "uncertainty today is unusually elevated" and that inflation is ticking up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many economists have warned that the tariffs – which are being met with trade retaliation by some countries – threaten to possibly tip the US economy and others into recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has admitted that the economy may suffer "a little disturbance" as his planned levies take hold, but that America is otherwise on the cusp of a "golden age".
  <br>
  <br>
  In Wednesday's message, he again stressed that April 2, when he plans to enact "reciprocal tariffs" designed to reset global trade, would be a "liberation day" for the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he wants US interest rates to come down as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy," he posted.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his first term, Trump repeatedly expressed disagreement with the Fed's rate decisions, urging them to be lowered to boost the economy. (AFP)

    Israel resumes ground attacks in Gaza

<img alt="Palestinians flee Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza, after Israel issued evacuation orders for some neighbourhoods. Photo: Abd Elhkeem Khaled/Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796554_1_20250320110026.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel resumed ground operations in Gaza and issued what it called a "last warning" for Palestinians to return hostages and remove Hamas from power.
 <br>
  <br>
  The operation on Wednesday followed Israel's most intense air strikes on Gaza since a truce took hold in January, killing more than 400 people, according to the territory's health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said it had "begun targeted ground operations in the central and southern Gaza Strip to expand the security perimeter and create a partial buffer between the north and south".
  <br>
  <br>
  As Israel defied calls from foreign governments to preserve the ceasefire, Gazans were left to once again comb through rubble to find the bodies of their loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're digging with our bare hands," said a man trying to dislodge a child's body from a heap of concrete in Gaza City.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Israel urged civilians to leave areas it described as "combat zones", families with young children filled the roads leading out of northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred Oola, senior medical officer at the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah, said the renewed strikes shattered the relative calm of the past two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, we can feel the panic in the air... and we can see the pain and devastation in the faces of those we are helping," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the "residents of Gaza," governed by Hamas since 2007, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a video: "This is the last warning."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Take the advice of the president of the United States. Return the hostages and remove Hamas, and other options will open up for you -- including the possibility of leaving for other places in the world for those who want to."
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to a warning earlier this month by US President Donald Trump, who said: "To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, 58 are still held by Gaza militants, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas says it is willing to negotiate and has called on the international community to act to bring the war to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official from the group rejected, however, Israeli demands to renegotiate the three-stage deal agreed with Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has not closed the door on negotiations but we insist there is no need for new agreements," Taher al-Nunu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks have stalled over how to proceed with the ceasefire, after the first phase expired in early March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and the United States have sought to change the terms of the deal by extending phase one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas wants negotiations for phase two, meant to establish a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza while the remaining hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moving to the second phase seems to be a non-option for Israel," said Ghassan Khatib, a political analyst and former Palestinian Authority minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They don't like the second phase because it involves ending the war without necessarily achieving their objective of ending Hamas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and Washington have portrayed Hamas's rejection of a phase one extension as a refusal to release more hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed Israeli bombardment sent a stream of new casualties to the few hospitals still functioning in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN Office for Project Services employee was killed and at least five other people wounded when a UN building in the central city of Deir el-Balah was hit by "explosive ordnance," the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was not an accident," UNOPS chief Jorge Moreira da Silva said, adding that "attacks against humanitarian premises are a breach of international law".
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 280 UN employees have been killed since the start of the war, according to the UN chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Israeli protesters massed in Jerusalem, accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of resuming strikes on Gaza without regard for the safety of the remaining hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war began with Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in 1,218 deaths, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gaza civil defence agency's spokesman Mahmud Bassal said on Wednesday that at least 470 people had been killed in the territory since Israel resumed large-scale air strikes overnight from Monday to Tuesday. (Reuters)

    White House attacks courts for 'usurping' powers

<img alt="Karoline Leavitt in a press briefing at the White House. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796546_1_20250320101240.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House accused judges of "usurping" executive power in its latest broadside against federal courts whose rulings have gone against President Donald Trump's administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Press secretary Karoline Leavitt alleged there had been a "concerted effort by the far left" to pick judges who were "clearly acting as partisan activists" to deal with cases involving the Republican's actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only are they usurping the will of the president and the chief executive of our country, but they are undermining the will of the American public," she said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt in particular lashed out at district judge James Boasberg, who ordered the suspension over the weekend of deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants carried out under an obscure wartime law, calling him a "Democrat activist."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport the alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador as part of its mass deportation program of undocumented migrants. Their names or alleged offences have not been made public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump personally called for the judge's impeachment on Tuesday, saying Boasberg was "a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yale-educated Boasberg, 62, was first appointed to the bench by president George W Bush, a Republican, and later named a district court judge by Obama, a Democrat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's comments drew a rare public rebuke from US Chief Justice John Roberts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision," Roberts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boasberg, in an order in the deportation case on Wednesday, also issued a pointed reminder to Justice Department lawyers that court rulings are to be obeyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the Supreme Court has made crystal clear, the proper recourse for a party subject to an injunction it believes is legally flawed... is appellate review, not disobedience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federal judges are nominated by the president for life and can only be removed by being impeached by the House of Representatives for "high crimes or misdemeanors" and convicted by the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impeachment of federal judges is exceedingly rare and the last time a judge was removed by Congress was in 2010.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in an interview aired on Fox News Channel's "The Ingraham Angle" on Wednesday, said the chief justice "didn't mention my name in the statement."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But many people have called for [Boasberg's] impeachment," he said. "He actually said we shouldn't be able to take criminals, killers, murderers, horrible, the worst people, gang members, gang leaders... out of our country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, that's a presidential job," Trump said. "That's not for a local judge to be making that determination."
  <br>
  <br>
  Judges have dealt Trump a number of setbacks in recent weeks as his administration pursues its wholesale overhaul of the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship has been blocked by the courts and a judge on Tuesday ordered an immediate halt to the shutdown of the main US aid agency by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same day, another judge suspended the Pentagon's ban on transgender people serving in the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South African-born billionaire Musk railed against what he called a "judicial coup" in posts on his social network X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need 60 senators to impeach the judges and restore rule of the people," Musk said, misstating the process and the actual number of senators required, which is 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller also lashed out at the judiciary, accusing it of waging an "assault on democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "District court judges have assumed the mantle of Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, Secretary of Homeland Security and Commander-in-Chief," Miller said on X. (AFP)
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, the first convicted felon to serve in the White House, has a history of attacking the judges who presided over his civil and criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump's administration now appears bent on a showdown with the judiciary as he asserts extraordinary levels of executive power. (AFP)

    Trump to sign order to dismantle Education Department

<img alt="A protester stands near the US Department of Education headquarters after the agency said it would lay off nearly half its staff. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796539_1_20250320092913.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump is expected to sign an order on Thursday aiming to dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling a long-held goal of American conservatives.
 <br>
  <br>
  The order, which several media outlets on Wednesday reported would be signed during a White House ceremony, comes as efforts are already underway in the department to drastically downsize its staffing and slash funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's education secretary, former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, issued a memo shortly after her swearing in on March 3 saying the agency would be beginning its "final mission."
  <br>
  <br>
  The next week, she moved to halve the department's staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, promised to decentralise education during his election campaign, saying he would devolve the department's powers to state governments, as desired for decades by many Republicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traditionally, the federal government has had a limited role in education in the United States, with only about 13 percent of funding for primary and secondary schools coming from federal coffers, the rest being funded by states and local communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But federal funding is invaluable for low-income schools and students with special needs. And the federal government has been essential in enforcing key civil rights protections for students.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, the Education Department, created in 1979, cannot be shuttered without the approval of Congress and Republicans do not have the votes to push that through.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, as with other federal agencies under Trump's second administration, the department is likely to see further cuts to programmes and employees, which could significantly cripple its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moves are being spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), whose rapid actions have met pushback in courts for possibly exceeding executive authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar move to dismantle the US Agency for International Development was halted on Monday by a federal judge, who said the push likely violated the Constitution. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chile said on Wednesday it was reviewing an agreement for the construction of a Chinese astronomical observatory on its soil, a project that has drawn criticism from Washington as it jostles with Beijing for influence in Latin America.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under an agreement signed by President Xi Jinping in 2016 with Chile's Catholic University of the North (UCN), the Ventarrones Astronomical Park was to be built in Chile's Atacama desert - home to the world's darkest skies and numerous other observatories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The project is under review, it is not cancelled," the foreign ministry in Santiago said in a statement, without providing reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said its legal department was studying the agreement and had contacted the UCN and the Chinese embassy for more information.
  <br>
  <br>
  UCN said it had made the requested data available. The embassy said the observatory was "an open and transparent international initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of Latin American countries have joined Xi's trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure program, and China has surpassed the United States as the biggest trading partner of Brazil, Peru, Chile and several other countries. (AFP)

    Japan marks 30 years since subway sarin attack

<img alt="A commuter is treated after being exposed to sarin gas fumes on the Tokyo Metro system on March 20, 1995. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796530_1_20250320083940.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan on Thursday marked the 30th anniversary of the sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway that killed more than a dozen people and injured more than 5,800.
 <br>
  <br>
  A small group of Tokyo subway workers were to hold a solemn annual ceremony at Kasumigaseki station at the heart of the capital's government district, one of several areas targeted in the 1995 carnage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims and experts warn that the cult behind the coordinated attack remains active and is recruiting young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  On March 20, 1995, five members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult dropped bags of Nazi-developed sarin nerve agent inside morning commuter trains, piercing the pouches with sharpened umbrella tips before fleeing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trains drove on, trapping passengers inside with the deadly fumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the trains stopped, passengers streamed out of stations vomiting and struggling to breathe, with emergency workers providing care by the side of the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack killed 13 people, while a 14th victim died in 2020 after suffering severe brain damage in the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 5,800 others were injured, many of whom are still suffering from vision problems, fatigue and psychological trauma.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cult's wild-haired, nearly blind leader Shoko Asahara was executed in 2018 along with 12 disciples for the attack and other violent crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asahara, whose real name was Chizuo Matsumoto, preached that the apocalypse was coming and that murders could elevate souls to a higher realm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aum has been disbanded, but its dead leader is still worshipped in Japan by an estimated 1,600 members of successor groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts warn that the groups are reaching young recruits in secret both in person and through social media and messaging apps, where they are also spreading posts saying that Aum's crimes were misportrayed. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's foreign minister David Lammy on Wednesday called for a transparent investigation into an Israeli air strike on a UN building in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Appalled a UN compound in Gaza was hit this morning," Lammy wrote on X. "This incident must be investigated transparently and those responsible held to account.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel announced renewed ground operations in Gaza on Wednesday and issued what it called a "last warning" to residents of the Palestinian territory to return hostages and remove Hamas from power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces this week conducted the deadliest wave of air strikes since the start of a truce in January, killing hundreds of people, according to the health ministry in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military said it had "begun targeted ground operations in the central and southern Gaza Strip to expand the security perimeter and create a partial buffer between the north and south".
  <br>
  <br>
  As Israel kept up its renewed bombardment despite a chorus of calls from foreign governments to preserve the ceasefire, long lines of fleeing civilians filled the roads of Gaza on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Families with young children fled northern Gaza for areas further south, fearing for their lives after Israel urged civilians to leave areas it described as "combat zones".
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred Oola, senior medical officer at the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah, said the renewed strikes had shattered the relative calm of the past two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, we can feel the panic in the air... and we can see the pain and devastation in the faces of those we are helping," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the "residents of Gaza", Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a video statement: "This is the last warning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, The Gaza civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on Wednesday killed 14 members of the same family in the northern town of Beit Lahia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that "at least 14 martyrs and several wounded from one family" were transferred to a hospital "after the (Israeli) occupation carried out an air strike targeting a house where a mourning tent was held", adding several people were feared buried under the rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  The casualties and victims had gathered at the home of a family who were mourning the recent loss of their loved ones when the strike occurred. They were then transferred to the Indonesian Hospital, according to the Palestinian News Agency. (AFP)

    Trump suggests US takeover of Ukraine's power plants

<img alt='The White House said that during the call Trump (Left) had floated US "ownership" of Ukrainian power plants as it would be the "best protection" for them.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump hailed a "very good" call with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday, a day after Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on Kyiv's power plants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said efforts to secure a full ceasefire in Russia's three-year-old war remained "on track," despite the fact that his call with Putin failed to produce any broader peace deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of continuing attacks, Zelensky said after the "frank" call that Ukraine was ready to pause strikes on both Russian energy and civilian infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he spoke for around an hour with his Ukrainian counterpart, their first conversation since they had a blazing televised row in the Oval Office just over two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs," Trump said on his Truth Social network.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very much on track."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House later said that during the call Trump had floated US "ownership" of Ukrainian power plants as it would be the "best protection" for them.

  </a>
  , RTHK's Washington correspondent Simon Marks said while Trump was showing American willingness to help Ukraine repair its damaged power infrastructure, it also showcased how transactional his administration is on foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was another one of those jarring moments at the White House when that was suddenly announced. There had been no indication at all leading up to either of these calls with Vladimir Putin or Volodymyr Zelensky that that was what Donald Trump had in mind... it also indicates that for Donald Trump, so many of these international issues he seems to think can be resolved like a business negotiation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire former real estate mogul has already pushed Kyiv into a deal to give the United States preferential access to its critical mineral resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also pledged to help Ukraine get more air defence equipment from Europe, a statement from National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while Ukraine has already agreed to a US plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Russia, Putin is still refusing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin leader insisted during his call with Trump that a full ceasefire was only possible if the West halts its billions of dollars in military aid to Kyiv – Moscow's long-standing demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin also demanded Ukraine must not be allowed to rearm, and that it must halt mandatory mobilisation. (AFP)

    Malaysia agrees terms for resumption of MH370 search

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia has agreed to the terms and conditions of an agreement with exploration firm Ocean Infinity to resume the search for the wreckage of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, its transport minister said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flight MH370, a Boeing 777, was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in 2014 in one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision will enable commencement of seabed search operations in a new location estimated to cover 15,000 sq km (5,790 sq miles) in the southern Indian Ocean, based on a "no find, no fee" principle, minister Loke Siew Fook said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity will receive US$70 million if the wreckage is successfully located, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the MH370 passengers," Loke said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Malaysian government in December said it had agreed in principle with Ocean Infinity's proposal to resume the hunt for MH370. The firm had conducted the last search for the plane that ended in 2018 but failed on two attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those followed an underwater search by Malaysia, Australia and China in a 120,000 sq km (46,332 sq mile) area of the southern Indian Ocean, based on the data of automatic connections between an Inmarsat satellite and the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  A ship that will look for the missing plane was deployed to its Indian Ocean search zone late last month, ship tracking data showed, even though a deal had yet to be signed with the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear how long the search contract with Ocean Infinity would be. Loke had previously said it would cover an 18-month period. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's resumption of strikes on the Gaza Strip is a major step in the wrong direction after its ceasefire with Palestinian militant group Hamas earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday alongside Jordan's King Abdullah II.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of Israeli strikes…despite the efforts of mediators, represents a dramatic step backwards," Macron said ahead of talks in Paris with Abdullah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's dramatic for the Palestinians of Gaza, who are again plunged into the terror of bombardment, and dramatic for the [Israeli] hostages and their families who live in the nightmare of uncertainty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel earlier this week carried out its deadliest bombing of Gaza since a fragile ceasefire began in January between Israel and the Palestinian territory's Islamist rulers Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed Israeli air strikes in the night of Monday to Tuesday killed more than 400 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. They have continued since.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron slammed Hamas, saying the "axis of resistance is today an illusion", but also warned Israel that there could be "no Israeli military solution in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jordanian king called the strikes "an extremely dangerous step that adds further devastation to an already dire humanitarian situation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire must be restored and the flow of aid must resume immediately," Abdullah said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the war stops, France has thrown its support behind a plan put forward by Arab nations, including Jordan, to rebuild Gaza without evicting its 2.4 million Palestinian residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We French and Europeans are ready to contribute to these deliberations and to this plan," Macron said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron said he and other European leaders would discuss it on Thursday at the European Council, "among ourselves and with the Secretary General of the United Nations".
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Britain, Germany and Italy earlier this month backed the plan, hailing it as a "realistic path" for Gaza to return to the control of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority after nearly two decades of Hamas rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and the United States have rejected the proposal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A UK teenager who killed three family members and planned to outdo notorious US massacres to become "the world's most famous school shooter of the 21st century" was on Wednesday jailed for a minimum of 49 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nicholas Prosper, 18 at the time of the killings, used a shotgun to kill his mother Juliana Falcon, 48, sister Giselle, 13, and brother Kyle, 16, who also received more than 100 knife wounds, at their home in Luton, southern England, in September 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Your ambition was notoriety. You wanted to be known posthumously as the world's most famous school shooter of the 21st century," Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said on Wednesday as she sentenced the now 19-year-old Prosper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosper told police upon his arrest of his "Friday the 13th" plan to kill four-year-old pupils and two teachers at a nearby primary school, and then himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said his aim was to conduct an attack more deadly than the US Sandy Hook and Virginia Tech massacres, but the plan was interrupted when his mother woke up before he could kill his family in their sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  The noisy struggle alerted neighbours, who called the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You explicitly sought to emulate and outdo Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old American who shot dead 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Connecticut in 2012," the judge said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You aimed for 34 deaths, one more than the deadliest school shooting of recent times in the United States of America, at Virginia Tech in 2007," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosper, who experts said showed symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), was handed a life sentence, with a minimum term of 49 years. Taking into account the time already served, he will serve a minimum of 48 years and 177 days. (AFP)

<img alt="Supporters and municipality workers hold a rally in Istanbul in support of mayor Ekrem Imamoglu following his arrest. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796448_1_20250319175032.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey's lira fell 12.7 percent and touched a new all-time low of 42 to the dollar on Wednesday, with bonds and stocks also tumbling sharply, after authorities detained President Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, who was expected to be named as the main opposition's presidential candidate within days, faces charges including corruption and aiding a terrorist group. The currency traded at 39.3 to the dollar at one stage, from a close of 36.67 on Tuesday, having recovered somewhat from the record low it hit earlier on Wednesday in what looked set to be its largest absolute daily move on record. Turkey's international government bonds also came under pressure with longer-dated maturities suffering the sharpest falls. The 2045 maturity slipped 1.5 cents to be bid at 85.13 cents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Turkey this morning, bonds and FX are coming under pressure after a potential presidential candidate, the mayor of Istanbul, was arrested," said Frantisek Taborsky, EMEA FX & fixed income strategist at ING.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Turkey's lira] is the most heavily positioned carry-trade in the emerging markets space at the moment in our view, and a sharp move could potentially lead to further outflows. On the other hand, we should see local banks providing some FX support."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks also crashed, reflecting investor worries over rule of law. Borsa Istanbul said trading was halted temporarily after the main BIST 100 index fell 6.87 percent in early trading and the market-wide circuit breaker was triggered.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BIST 100 index was down 4.97  percent at one stage while the banking sub-index declined 7.57 percent after trading resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A wave of selling was triggered after Imamoglu's diploma was annulled and he was detained. There have been foreign investor inflows in recent days...but political uncertainty currently prevails and concerns about foreign investors leaving the country have increased," Serhat Baskurt, algorithmic operations manager at ALB Yatırım, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baskurt said he expected the decline on the stock exchange to continue over the coming days. (Reuters)

<img alt="US officials say talks aimed at a ceasefire in Ukraine would be held in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah on Sunday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796380_1_20250319110641.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Talks on a ceasefire in Russia's conflict with Ukraine will continue on Sunday in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Fox News hours after Trump held a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Witkoff said talks on a ceasefire deal "will begin on Sunday in Jeddah."
  <br>
  <br>
  Witkoff said the US delegation in Saudi Arabia would be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, but did not indicate who they would be holding talks with.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referring to a ceasefire on energy infrastructure and targets in the Black Sea, Witkoff said: "I think both of those are now agreed to by the Russians. I am certainly hopeful that the Ukrainians will agree to it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine on Wednesday accused Russia of effectively rejecting the US-backed ceasefire proposal, reporting a barrage of strikes on civilian infrastructure hours after Moscow agreed only to pause attacks on the energy grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington has been pushing for a full, 30-day ceasefire as a first step towards a wider peace settlement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a 90-minute call with Trump on Tuesday, Russian President Putin refused, insisting that any such deal would be contingent on Ukraine's allies halting all military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Kremlin, Putin has already ordered his military to pause strikes against Ukrainian energy targets for 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witkoff, however, reiterated the proposed ceasefire included "energy and infrastructure in general."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's envoy commended Russian President Putin "for all he did today on that call to move his country close to a final peace deal." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Wednesday accused Russia of effectively rejecting a US-backed ceasefire proposal, reporting a barrage of strikes on civilian infrastructure hours after Moscow agreed only to pause attacks on the energy grid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington has been pushing for a full, 30-day ceasefire as a first step towards a wider settlement of the grinding three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in a 90-minute call with Donald Trump on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin refused, insisting that any such deal would be contingent on the West halting all military aid for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Kremlin, Putin has already ordered his military to pause strikes against Ukrainian energy targets for 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The highly anticipated Putin-Trump call also resulted in the announcement that Russia and Ukraine will exchange 175 prisoners each on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky welcomed the proposed energy truce but said he needed more "details" from Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has launched devastating attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the war, while Ukraine has used drones to bomb multiple Russian oil installations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions rang out and air raid sirens wailed in Ukraine just hours after Trump and Putin spoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said "there have been hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure", including a hospital in Sumy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is these types of nighttime attacks by Russia that destroy our energy sector, our infrastructure, and the normal life of Ukrainians," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Kyiv, Ukrainians were doubtful of any concessions from Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lev Sholoudko, 32 said he did not expect even the energy infrastructure would be spared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't believe Putin at all, not a single word. He only understands force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who says he has an "understanding" with Putin, has been seeking a breakthrough in the Ukraine war since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stunned the world when he announced he had started direct talks with Russia to end the conflict, sparking fears among allies that he was pivoting too far towards Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president hailed his latest call with Putin as "good and productive," and the White House said in a readout that the Russian leader had consented to a 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Moscow also underlined that a fuller truce was dependent on long-standing demands for a "complete cessation" of Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Kremlin statement also emphasised that Kyiv could not rearm or mobilise during any ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky, who accepted a full ceasefire proposal during talks in Saudi Arabia last week, has lashed out at Russia for its reluctance to reach a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are not ready to end this war, and we can see that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky also said that Ukrainian troops would continue fighting in Russia's Kursk region "as long as we need," following days of major Russian advances in the area that Kyiv partially seized last year. (AFP)

    Trump to unveil reciprocal tariffs on April 2

<img alt="US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said if countries stop their practices, the US would not put up the tariff wall. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796362_1_20250319092836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington is expected to present US trading partners on April 2 with a number representing their tariff and other barriers, as it unveils reciprocal levies tailored to each country, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump has promised reciprocal duties - on both US allies and competitors alike - from April 2, though his administration has yet to release the exact details of the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What's going to happen on April 2 - each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs," Bessent told Fox Business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added on "Mornings With Maria."
  <br>
  <br>
  With just over two weeks until April 2, he did not say whether those calculations would be complete for all nations by the deadline, but left open the door to some avoiding reciprocal tariffs on that date.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some duties "may not have to go on because a deal is pre-negotiated," he said, or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks once they receive their number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Monday on social media that April 2 would be "Liberation Day for America," promising to "start taking back some of the vast wealth that has been taken from us."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's tariff plans and the uncertainty surrounding them have shaken markets in recent weeks, fanning fears that an economic ebb could be in the cards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Bessent told Fox Business that he saw "no reason we need to have a recession," saying "the underlying economy is healthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former hedge fund manager raised the idea of a "pause" as the economy transitions away from "unsustainable" levels of government spending, pledging that the Trump administration would rein in expenditures and bring manufacturing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Bessent stressed that Trump has identified "critical industries" - like steel and aluminium among manufacturing sectors - for which he hopes to bring production back to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "we're going to take in substantial revenues," pointing to these as a means to offset the government deficit. (AFP)

<img alt="A man starts to rebuild his home in a shanty town destroyed by Cyclone Chido on the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte in January. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796360_1_20250319091826.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee climate disasters last year, the United Nations said on Wednesday, highlighting the urgent need for early warning systems covering the entire planet.
 <br>
  <br>
  Poorer countries are severely affected by cyclones, droughts, wildfires and other disasters, according to the State of the Global Climate annual report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN's weather and climate agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WMO said the record number of people fleeing climate disasters was based on figures from the International Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which has been collecting data on the subject since 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Mozambique, around 100,000 people were displaced by Cyclone Chido.
  <br>
  <br>
  But wealthy countries were also hit, with the WMO pointing to the floods in the Spanish city of Valencia, which killed 224 people, and the devastating fires in Canada and the United States which forced more than 300,000 people to flee their homes in search of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response, WMO and the global community are intensifying efforts to strengthen early warning systems and climate services," said the agency's chief Celeste Saulo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WMO wants everyone in the world covered by such systems by the end of 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides underlining the massive economic and social upheavals from extreme weather, the State of the Global Climate report said climate change indicators had once again reached record levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The clear signs of human-induced climate change reached new heights in 2024, with some of the consequences being irreversible over hundreds if not thousands of years," the WMO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2015 Paris climate accords aimed to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - and to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, and the first calendar year over the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold, with the global mean near-surface temperature 1.55 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average, according to an analysis compiling the six major international datasets.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday issued a rare public rebuke of President Donald Trump, over his call for the impeachment of a federal judge, in an extraordinary display of conflict between the executive and judiciary branches.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rebuke from the Supreme Court's leader demonstrated how controversy over recent flights of Venezuelan immigrants has inflamed tensions over the judiciary's role, with a legal case challenging Trump's actions now threatening to spiral into a clash of constitutional powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision," Roberts said in a brief statement. "The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  The rare statement came just hours after a social media post from Trump, who described US District Judge James E Boasberg as an unelected “troublemaker and agitator.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Boasberg had issued an order blocking deportation flights that Trump was carrying out by invoking wartime authorities from an 18th century law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been sharply critical of district courts which have blocked some of the president's executive actions but this was the first time Trump has personally called for a judge's impeachment since he took office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federal judges are nominated by the president for life and can only be removed by being impeached by the House of Representatives for "high crimes or misdemeanors" and convicted by the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impeachment of federal judges is exceedingly rare and the last time a judge was removed by Congress was in 2010. (Agencies)

 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Tuesday that massive overnight strikes on Gaza were "only the beginning" and that future negotiations with Hamas "will take place only under fire".
 <br>
  <br>
  The strikes, by far the largest since a truce took effect in January, killed more than 400 people across Gaza, according to its health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said in a video statement on Tuesday evening that "Hamas has already felt the strength of our arm in the past 24 hours. And I want to promise you - and them - this is only the beginning".
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations have stalled over how to proceed with a ceasefire whose first phase has expired, with Israel and Hamas disagreeing on whether to move to a new phase intended to bring the war to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli premier said in his address that "from now on, negotiations will take place only under fire," before adding: "Military pressure is essential for the release of additional hostages".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the return of all the hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the October 2023 attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has not responded militarily so far, and in a statement urged friendly countries to "pressure" the United States to bring to an end the strikes by its ally Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Israel consulted US President Donald Trump's administration before launching the strikes, while Israel said the return to fighting was "fully coordinated" with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  A State Department spokesperson said that "Hamas bears total responsibility... for the resumption of hostilities".
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations and countries around the world condemned the strikes, while the families of Israeli hostages pleaded with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt the violence, fearing for the fate of their loved ones. (AFP)

    US releases final trove of Kennedy assassination files

<img alt="Documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy are displayed after they were released. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796353_1_20250319084345.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US National Archives on Tuesday released the final batch of files related to the assassination of president John F Kennedy - a case that still fuels conspiracy theories more than 60 years after his death.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move follows an executive order issued by US President Donald Trump in January directing the unredacted release of the remaining files related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother, former attorney general Robert F Kennedy, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In accordance with President Donald Trump's directive... all records previously withheld for classification that are part of the President John F Kennedy Assassination Records Collection are released," the Archives said in a statement on its website on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Archives has released millions of pages of records over the past decades relating to the assassination of then-president Kennedy in November 1963, but thousands of documents had been held back at the request of the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation, citing national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warren Commission that investigated the shooting of the charismatic 46-year-old president determined that it was carried out by a former Marine sharpshooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that formal conclusion has done little to quell speculation that a more sinister plot was behind Kennedy's murder in Dallas, Texas, and the slow release of the government files has added fuel to various conspiracy theories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy scholars have said the documents that were still held by the archives were unlikely to contain any bombshell revelations or put to rest the rampant conspiracy theories about the assassination of the 35th US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oswald was shot by a strip club owner, Jack Ruby, on November 24, 1963 - two days after the Kennedy assassination - while being moved to a county jail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the records already released were raw intelligence, including scores of reports from FBI agents following up leads that led nowhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of what they contain was also previously known, such as that the communist-obsessed CIA cooked up several outlandish plots to murder Cuba's Fidel Castro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 but returned to the United States in 1962.
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of the documents follows an October 26, 1992 act of Congress which required that the unredacted assassination records held in the National Archives be released in full 25 years later. (AFP)

    Nasa astronauts Wilmore and Williams splash down

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned to Earth in a SpaceX capsule on Tuesday with a soft splashdown off Florida's coast, nine months after their faulty Boeing Starliner craft upended what was to be a week-long stay on the International Space Station.
 <br>
  <br>
  Their return caps a protracted space mission that was fraught with uncertainty and technical troubles and turned a rare instance of Nasa's contingency planning - and the latest failures of Boeing's Starliner - into a global spectacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams, two veteran Nasa astronauts and retired US Navy test pilots, had strapped inside their Crew Dragon spacecraft along with two other astronauts and undocked from the orbiting laboratory of the ISS at 1.05 a.m. ET (0505 GMT) to embark on a 17-hour trip to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-person crew, formally part of Nasa's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, re-entered Earth's atmosphere around 5:45 p.m. ET. Using Earth's atmosphere and two sets of parachutes, the craft slowed its orbital speed of roughly 17,000 miles per hour to a soft 17 miles per hour at splashdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dressed in re-entry suits, boots and helmets, the astronauts were seen earlier on Nasa's live footage laughing, hugging and posing for photos with their colleagues from the station shortly before they were shut into the capsule for two hours of final pressure, communications and seal tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The astronaut pair had launched into space as Starliner's first crew in June for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission. But issues with Starliner's propulsion system led to cascading delays to their return home, culminating in a Nasa decision last year to have them take a SpaceX craft back this year as part of the agency's crew rotation schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission has captured the attention of US President Donald Trump, who upon taking office in January called for a quicker return of Wilmore and Williams and alleged without evidence that former President Joe Biden "abandoned" them on the ISS for political reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, echoed his call for an earlier return. SpaceX's Crew Dragon is the United States' only orbital-class crew spacecraft, which Boeing had hoped its Starliner would compete with before the mission with Wilmore and Williams threw its development future into uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the splashdown, the astronauts will be flown to their crew quarters at the space agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston for several days of health checks, per routine for astronaut returns, before Nasa flight surgeons approve they can go home to their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Living in space for months can affect the human body in multiple ways, from muscle atrophy to possible vision impairment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams have logged 286 days in space on the mission - longer than the average six-month ISS mission length, but far short of US record holder Frank Rubio. His continuous 371 days in space, ending in 2023, were the unexpected result of a coolant leak on a Russian spacecraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams, capping her third spaceflight, has tallied 608 cumulative days in space, the second most for any US astronaut after Peggy Whitson's 675 days. Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko set the world record last year at 878 cumulative days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swept up in Nasa's routine astronaut rotation schedule, Wilmore and Williams could not begin their return to Earth until their replacement crew arrived, in order to maintain adequate US staffing levels, according to Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their replacements arrived on Friday night - four astronauts as part of Nasa's Crew-10 mission that briefly put the station's headcount at 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short," Wilmore told reporters from space earlier this month, adding that he did not believe Nasa's decision to keep them on the ISS until Crew-10's arrival had been affected by politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's what your nation's human spaceflight programme's all about," he said. "Planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams had been doing scientific research and conducting routine maintenance with the station's other five astronauts. Williams had performed two six-hour spacewalks for maintenance outside the ISS, including one with Wilmore.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ISS, about 254 miles (409 km) in altitude, is a football field-sized research lab that has been housed continuously by international crews of astronauts for nearly 25 years, a key platform of science diplomacy managed primarily by the US and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams told reporters earlier this month that she was looking forward to returning home to see her two dogs and family. "It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us," she said. (Reuters)

    Germany votes for big defence spending package

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German lawmakers gave the green light on Tuesday for a colossal spending boost for defence and infrastructure pushed by chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz amid deep fears in Europe over the future strength of the transatlantic alliance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unprecedented fiscal package – dubbed an "XXL-sized" cash "bazooka" by German media – could pave the way for more than one trillion euros in spending over the next decade in Europe's top economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The historic parliament vote signalled a radical departure for a country famously reluctant to take on large state debt – or to spend heavily on the armed forces, given its dark World War II history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz, who is expected to become Germany's next chancellor after his CDU/CSU alliance won last month's elections, argued that dramatic steps are needed at a time of geopolitical turmoil sparked by Russia's war with Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  European countries have been further unsettled by US President Donald Trump's outreach to Russia and signals of an uncertain commitment to Nato and Europe's defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to parliament, Merz cited Russia's "war of aggression against Europe" and said the funding boost would spell "the first major step towards a new European defence community".
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz's centre-right alliance and their likely future coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have hammered out the package over recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan would exempt defence spending above one percent of GDP from Germany's strict debt rules and set up a 500-billion-euro (US$545-billion) fund for infrastructure investments over 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the short term, Berlin looked set to soon approve an additional three billion euros in military aid for Ukraine. (AFP)

<img alt="The two spoke for more than an hour and a half, and both expressed hopes for repairing relations between the countries. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796323_1_20250319031834.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Tuesday on a halt in Russian attacks against Ukrainian energy targets – but fell far short of securing a full ceasefire in a highly anticipated phone call.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two spoke for more than an hour and a half, and both expressed hopes for repairing relations between the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was no agreement from the Russian president for Washington's proposed full 30-day ceasefire in Russia's war with its pro-Western neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said Putin agreed to pause strikes on Ukraine energy targets for 30 days and that Putin had already given the order to his military. The White House said separately that the "leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire".
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has launched a series of devastating attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the three-year-old war. According to the Kremlin statement, Ukraine – which has bombed multiple Russian oil installations – had also agreed to the truce on energy targets, although Kyiv had yet to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders agreed that broader truce talks would "begin immediately in the Middle East," the White House said in its statement, also citing a "huge upside" if Russia and the United States improve their relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Kremlin statement said a "key condition" for peace would be ending Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military – a position that will alarm Kyiv and European capitals that have already accused Putin of stalling. (AFP)
