  <div class="itemFullText">
   Brat, the word redefined by singer Charli XCX and adopted by supporters of US presidential candidate Kamala Harris, was on Friday named the Collins Word of the Year 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Brat" was the name of the UK singer's hit sixth album, and the word has now come to represent a "confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude," said Collins, rather than simply a term for a badly-behaved child.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Inspired by the Charli XCX album, 'brat' has become one of the most talked about words of 2024," said the UK-based dictionary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "More than a hugely successful album, 'brat' is a cultural phenomenon that has resonated with people globally, and 'brat summer' established itself as an aesthetic and a way of life," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 32-year-old pop star, whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison, described the typical brat girl as someone "who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes, who feels herself, but then also maybe has a breakdown, but kind of parties through it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She tweeted in July that "Kamala IS brat," in reference to the US Vice President, prompting the presidential nominee to use her song "365" in one of her TikTok videos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Her campaign account also re-branded with a lime green photo in the style of the Brat album cover.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The album hit number one in her native UK and number three in the US. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rescuers on Friday raised the death toll in Spain's worst floods for a generation to at least 205 as the government deployed more troops in an increasingly desperate search for survivors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The floods that have tossed vehicles, collapsed bridges and covered towns with mud since Tuesday are the European country's deadliest such disaster in decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The organisation coordinating emergency services in the hardest-hit eastern Valencia region said 202 people had been confirmed dead there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials in neighbouring Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia had already announced a combined three deaths in their regions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rescuers equipped with drones and sniffer dogs waded through the water and rummaged through debris in search of the dozens of people the authorities believe are still missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government is deploying an extra 500 troops to the stricken areas to bolster the 1,200 already on site for search, rescue and logistics tasks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some cut-off areas remain without water, food or power three days after the floods began, and many roads and rail lines remain inaccessible, raising fears the death toll will climb.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is still a pile of cars in the industrial estate, mountains and mountains of cars," Amparo Fort, mayor of the town of Chiva, told public radio RNE.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Many must be empty, but we are sure others are occupied," Fort said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to national weather service AEMET, the town west of Valencia city recorded 491 mm of rain in just eight hours on Tuesday – almost equalling a year's worth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Government minister Angel Victor Torres on Thursday vowed an uncompromising response to looting, in a sign order was breaking down in some places.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police on Friday said they had arrested 50 people for incidents including theft from cars and a jewellery store.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the Valencia region town of Aldaia, Fernando Lozano said he saw thieves grabbing items from an abandoned supermarket as "people are a bit desperate".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Until things return to normal and the supermarket opens, it's going to be very bad here."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Slabs of tarmac from destroyed roads littered fields inundated with murky brown water and mud caked the ground floor of homes in the Valencia region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The courthouse in Valencia city has been converted into a morgue, where health workers wearing smocks carried stretchers covered with white sheets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An army of hundreds of volunteers set off from Valencia on Friday armed with shovels, buckets and shopping trolleys laden with food and nappies to help distressed neighbours in the city's flooded suburbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez hailed "the limitless solidarity and dedication of Spanish society" on X and pledged aid "for as long as it takes."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Valencia regional government urged people not to travel to the worst-affected areas, saying emergency services could not reach them and that roads risked collapsing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hundreds of people spent a third night without power or communications and slept in temporary shelters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   AEMET placed part of the southern Andalusia region on the highest alert level for torrential rain on Friday and maintained warnings for Valencia, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The storm that sparked the floods formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for the time of year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But scientists say climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events. (AFP)

    Boeing workers to vote on new contract offer

  <img alt="Boeing workers who have been on strike since September are set to vote on a new contract offer next week. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777245_1_20241101192259.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Striking Boeing workers will vote on Monday on an improved contract offer that includes a 38 percent pay rise over four years and a larger signing bonus, and carries the endorsement of their union.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest offer, presented on Thursday, comes after Boeing this week announced it would raise up to US$24.3 billion to shore up its battered finances as a seven-week strike by more than 33,000 factory workers in Seattle worsens its cash burn.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In every negotiation and strike, there is a point where we have extracted everything that we can in bargaining and by withholding our labour. We are at that point now and risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future," the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, Boeing said it encourages "all of our employees to learn more about the improved offer and vote on Monday, November 4,” noting that the average machinist will make US$119,309 by the end of the contract if the offer is accepted, up from US$75,608.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was the fourth offer made by Boeing since early September, but the third on which members have been asked to vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing's first offer of a 25 percent wage increase, which was endorsed by the union, was rejected by nearly 95 percent of workers in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, some 64 percent of workers rejected an offer of a 35 percent general wage increase over four years that was not endorsed by the union.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing's latest offer also includes a US$12,000 ratification bonus, the IAM said in a statement. It combines a previously offered US$7,000 ratification bonus and a US$5,000 lump sum into the members' 401(k) retirement account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The other conditions in the contract remain unchanged, such as an annual bonus and the company's commitment to build its next plane -- expected in 2025 -- in the Seattle area, where Boeing was founded in July 1916.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The negotiating team, however, had been pushing for a 40 percent wage increase, as well as the return of a defined-benefit pension that members lost a decade ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike has halted production of its strongest-selling 737 MAX jet and its 767 and 777 widebodies. (Reuters/AFP)

    Spain flooding death toll rises to 158

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Spain mourned at least 158 deaths on Friday as authorities told people in flood-stricken regions to stay at home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An exceptionally powerful Mediterranean storm from Tuesday unleashed heavy rains and torrents of mud-filled water that swept away people and wrecked homes, with the eastern Valencia region hit hardest.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The body coordinating rescue work in Valencia announced 155 bodies had been recovered there by Thursday afternoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials in Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia had announced a combined three deaths in their regions on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But "dozens and dozens" of people remain missing two days after the start of the catastrophe, government minister Angel Victor Torres told reporters, raising fears the death toll could rise further.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some rural areas also remain inaccessible to rescuers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Please, stay at home... follow the calls of the emergency services," pleaded Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   European officials pointed on Thursday to the floods in Spain as a reminder of the self-harming effects of humans' destruction of nature, urging delegates at a deadlocked UN biodiversity conference in Colombia to "act."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   European Commission envoy Florika Fink-Hooijer said the "catastrophe" in the Valencia region highlighted the link between biodiversity loss and human-caused climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Worsening droughts and flooding cause the loss of plant species such as trees -- which serve as a bulwark against some of the worst effects of global warming.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If we act on biodiversity, we at least can buffer some of the climate impacts," Fink-Hooijer said at a press conference in the city of Cali, host of the 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) to the UN's Convention on Biodiversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At this COP we really have a chance to act," said the envoy, who is also the European Commission director-general for environment. (AFP)

    Brussels launches investigation into Temu

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777069_1_20241031192419.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The EU launched a formal investigation on Thursday into Chinese-founded e-commerce platform Temu on suspicion the site is doing too little to stop the sale of illegal products, in a probe that could lead to large fines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Extremely popular in the European Union despite having entered the continent's market only last year, Temu has on average around 92 million monthly active users in the bloc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The investigation will also look at dangers from the platform's "potentially addictive design" that could have "negative consequences" on users' "physical and mental well-being," said the European Commission, the EU's powerful digital watchdog.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The probe is being launched under a mammoth law known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) that forces the world's largest tech firms to do more to protect European consumers online.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We want to ensure that Temu is complying with the Digital Services Act. Particularly in ensuring that products sold on their platform meet EU standards and do not harm consumers," EU tech chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU wants to know more about the systems Temu has in place to "limit the sale" of illegal products as well as how the platform restricts their "reappearance".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu will also have to explain what measures it is taking to address any risks from its service, including game-like reward programmes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu said it would cooperate with the EU.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Temu takes its obligations under the DSA seriously, continuously investing to strengthen our compliance system and safeguard consumer interests on our platform," a Temu spokesperson said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will cooperate fully with regulators to support our shared goal of a safe, trusted marketplace for consumers," the spokesperson said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU probe will also look at Temu's systems and how they recommend content and products to users as well as whether the platform is complying with the obligation to give researchers access to Temu's publicly available data, the commission said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu will also have to provide more details about the "parameters" of its recommender systems, which are used by platforms to push more personalised content.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU stressed that the "opening of formal proceedings does not prejudge its outcome" and there is no deadline for the probe's completion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu is among 25 "very large" online platforms that must comply with the DSA or risk fines that could reach as high as six percent of their global turnover, or even a ban for serious and repeated violations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other shopping platforms that must comply with the DSA include Chinese online retailer AliExpress, US giant Amazon and Chinese-founded Shein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other DSA investigations have targeted AliExpress, social media platform X, which is owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk and used to be called Twitter, as well as Facebook and Instagram owned by Meta. (AFP)

    EU greenhouse emissions fell in 2023 says EEA

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by eight percent in 2023 but the cuts being made are falling short of EU targets, the European Environment Agency (EEA) reported on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Following this "largest year-on-year reduction in several decades," emissions were now 37 percent below 1990 levels, the EEA said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The huge drop was led by a significant decline in coal use and growth of renewable energy sources and supported by reduced energy consumption across Europe," said an agency statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The share of renewable energy in Europe's energy consumption has risen from 10.2 percent in 2005 to 24 percent in 2023, the agency said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Based on existing measures, projections signal a 43 percent reduction in net emissions in EU countries by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, falling short of the 55 percent target set by the EU, the agency warned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that "22 member states have submitted additional projections that include planned but not yet launched measures."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Together, these would reduce net emissions in the EU by 49 percent below 1990 levels in 2030," the EEA said, coming closer but still falling short of the target.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "To close the remaining gap by 2030, it is essential that emissions reductions continue at a swift pace over the coming years," the EEA said. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Bank of Japan warned on Thursday of "high uncertainties" following the ruling party's worst election result in 15 years, as it kept interest rates unchanged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition lost its majority in Sunday's snap vote, likely forcing him to head a minority government with support from other parties to pass legislation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Businesses and economists worry that as concessions to other parties, Ishiba, 67, will offer tax cuts and higher spending, and go slow on reforms needed to improve Japan's competitiveness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are also concerns that the government may pressure the BoJ to take a break from the gradual normalisation begun this year of its ultra-loose monetary policy, even if it leads to a weaker yen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the opposition Democratic Party for the People (DPP) – which Ishiba has been courting for support – on Tuesday urged the BoJ "to avoid making big policy changes now".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For a long time, the BoJ was an outlier among major central banks, sticking to its ultra-loose policy to spur inflation after the "lost decades" of stagnant or falling prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The BoJ ditched negative rates in March, lifting borrowing costs for the first time since 2007 and then again in July – signalling more was to come.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The BoJ on Thursday kept its main short-term policy rate at 0.25 percent, as widely expected, warning of "high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank also said it was paying "due attention" to other economies, particularly the United States ahead of presidential elections on November 5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The BoJ again signalled that it would raise borrowing costs if inflation develops as it expects, saying the Japanese economy "is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The central bank said it expected inflation of 2.5 percent for the current fiscal year to March 2025 before moderating to two percent in the following two years. (AFP)

    N Korea fires 'long-range' ballistic missile: Seoul

  <img alt="The launch came just hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776947_1_20241031075514.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   North Korea on Thursday fired a "long-range ballistic missile", South Korea's military said, Pyongyang's first weapons test since Seoul accused it of sending tens of thousands of soldiers to Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea's military had warned a day earlier that the nuclear-armed North was preparing to test another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) or even conduct a nuclear test, possibly ahead of next week's US elections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our military detected one ballistic missile launched from the Pyongyang area toward the East Sea at approximately 7:10 AM (2210 GMT) today," Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The ballistic missile is presumed to be a long-range missile launched at a high angle," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korea typically test-fires its longest-range and most powerful missiles on a so-called lofted trajectory – fired up, not out – which it says is to avoid overflying neighbouring countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our military has heightened its alert level and is closely sharing information regarding North Korea's ballistic missile with the US and Japan authorities, maintaining a thorough readiness posture," Seoul's JCS added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tokyo also confirmed a possible launch, with Japan's coastguard reporting an "object potentially a ballistic missile launched from North Korea" and warning vessels to take care.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The launch came just hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia, where Washington says some 10,000 have been deployed for possible action against Ukrainian forces.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The defence chiefs of South Korea and the United States condemned North Korea's troop deployment to Russia in the "strongest" terms at the allies' annual defence talks at the Pentagon on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul has previously said the nuclear-armed North's accelerating deployment posed a "significant security threat," with the military telling lawmakers on Wednesday that thousands of troops had been moved to western Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The fact that such a large number of personnel has moved westward suggests they are unlikely to have gone merely for observation," a presidential official said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul, a major weapons exporter, has said it is reviewing whether to send weapons directly to Ukraine in response, something it has previously resisted due to longstanding domestic policy that prevents it from providing weaponry into active conflicts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul has long accused the nuclear-armed North of sending weapons to help Moscow fight Kyiv and alleged that Pyongyang has moved to deploy soldiers en mass in the wake of Kim Jong-un's signing of a mutual defence deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korea has denied sending troops, but in the first comment in state media last week, its vice foreign minister said that if such a deployment to happen, it would be in line with international law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pyongyang is banned from tests using ballistic technology by multiple rounds of UN sanctions, but Kim Jong-un has ramped up testing this year, with experts warning he could be testing weaponry before providing it to Russia. (AFP)

    UK to raise taxes by 40 billion pounds annually

  <img alt="Rachel Reeves announces a string of tax increases, as she seeks to uphold her new rule get day-to-day spending back into balance by the end of the decade. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776929_1_20241031012156.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Britain's new finance minister Rachel Reeves announced the biggest tax increases in three decades in her first budget on Wednesday, accusing the former Conservative government of breaking the country's public services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Businesses and the wealthy were set to bear the brunt of the tax hikes, and Reeves also paved the way for higher borrowing for investment to speed up Britain's economy, which has been slowed by the 2007-09 global financial crisis, Brexit, Covid and soaring energy prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former Bank of England economist – who said she was proud to be the first female Chancellor of the Exchequer – stressed there would be no repeat of how former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss sent the bond market into a tailspin in 2022 with her unfunded tax cut plans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Initial reaction to her speech suggested investors were unfazed by the Labour Party's first economic programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But government prices fell later as the scale of the planned spending became apparent and investors scaled back their bets on Bank of England interest rate cuts next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves said she would raise taxes by 40 billion pounds (US$52 billion) a year, blaming the Conservatives for leaving her Labour Party with a budget "black hole".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Any responsible Chancellor would take action," she said. "That is why today, I am restoring stability to our public finances and rebuilding our public services." She painted a grim picture of Britain, with record waiting times in the health service, children studying in crumbling schools and dysfunctional transport and justice systems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank, tax hikes of 40 billion pounds would be equivalent to 1.25 percent of economic output, surpassed in recent history only in 1993 by a budget plan under the Conservatives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Keir Starmer had warned "those with the broadest shoulders" would have to pay more to spare "working people."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The yield on 10-year British government bonds – which moves in the opposite direction to prices – was up by around four basis points on the day at 1600 GMT, having fallen sharply during Reeves' speech earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors were pricing in fewer interest rate cuts by the BoE given the scale of government spending with four quarter-point reductions expected in 2025 compared with about five earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves announced a string of tax increases, saying "difficult decisions cannot be constantly delayed or deferred" as she sought to uphold her new rule get day-to-day spending back into balance by the end of the decade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rate of social security contributions paid by employers will rise by 1.2 percentage points to 15 percent from April, and a threshold at which firms start to pay it will come down, raising an extra 25 billion pounds a year in five years' time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other revenue-raising moves included changes to taxes on capital gains and inheritances and tax paid by private equity executives, non-domiciled residents and users of private jets and private schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Reeves unexpectedly ruled out making more individuals pay basic and higher income tax rates after a freeze on the threshold for payments expires in the 2028/29 tax year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She also extended a freeze on fuel duty and cut a tax on draught beer in pubs, measures that could help to reverse a fall in support for Starmer's fledgling government in opinion polls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In another significant move, Reeves said she would change a second fiscal rule to allow for more borrowing, paving the way for 100 billion pounds in investment over the next five years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves said the government will now target a fall in public sector net financial liabilities as a share of the economy, rather than public sector net debt excluding the BoE. (Reuters)

    Scientists recreate face of woman buried as a vampire

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Buried with a padlock on her foot and an iron sickle across her neck, "Zosia" was never supposed to be able to come back from the dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Entombed in an unmarked cemetery in Pien, northern Poland, the young woman was one of dozens feared by her neighbours to have been a "vampire".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Now, using DNA, 3D printing and modelling clay, a team of scientists has reconstructed Zosia's 400-year-old face, revealing the human story buried by supernatural beliefs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's really ironic, in a way," said Swedish archaeologist Oscar Nilsson. "These people burying her, they did everything they could in order to prevent her from coming back from the dead... we have done everything we can in order to bring her back to life."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zosia, as she was named by locals, was found in 2022 by a team of archaeologists from Torun's Nicolaus Copernicus University.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Aged 18-20 when she died, analysis of Zosia's skull suggests she suffered from a health condition which would have caused fainting and severe headaches, as well as possible mental health issues, Nilsson said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sickle, the padlock and certain types of wood found at the grave site were all believed at the time to hold magical properties protecting against vampires, according to the Nicolaus Copernicus team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zosia's was Grave No. 75 at the unmarked cemetery in Pien, outside the northern city of Bydgoszcz. Among the other bodies found at the site was a "vampire" child, buried face down and similarly padlocked at the foot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Little is known of Zosia's life, but Nilsson and the Pien team say items she was buried with point to her being from a wealthy — possibly noble — family.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 17th century Europe she lived in was ravaged by war, something Nilsson suggests created a climate of fear in which belief in supernatural monsters was commonplace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nilsson's recreation began with creating a 3D printed replica of the skull, before gradually building layers of plasticine clay "muscle by muscle" to form a life-like face.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He uses bone structure combined with information on gender, age, ethnicity and approximate weight to estimate the depth of facial features.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's emotional to watch a face coming back from the dead, especially when you know the story about this young girl," Nilsson says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nilsson said he wanted to bring Zosia back "as a human, and not as this monster that she is buried as". (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Spain braced for a heavier human toll after at least 95 people died in flash floods that launched muddy waters through towns, tossed cars and wreaked transport havoc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rescuers were expected to find more bodies in the European country's deadliest flood in more than 50 years and three days of official mourning were due to start on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Television pictures from the town of Utiel showed rescuers using dinghies worked in the dark to scour the floodwaters and taking several people to safety. Emergency services were still working to reach the worst-hit areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For those who at this moment are still looking for their loved ones, the whole of Spain weeps with you," Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address, vowing to "rebuild your streets, your squares, your bridges".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Carlos Mazon, the regional leader of Valencia, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of citrus production in the world's top orange supplier, said some people remained isolated in inaccessible locations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If (emergency services) have not arrived, it's not due to a lack of means or predisposition, but a problem of access," Mazon told a press conference, adding that reaching certain areas was "absolutely impossible".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least 62 people died in Valencia, while authorities in the central region of Castilla La Mancha said the storm had left two people dead and several missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dozens of videos shared on social media overnight appeared to show people trapped by the floodwaters, with some climbing into trees to avoid being swept away. Footage showed rescue workers carrying several women in a bulldozer's bucket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trains to the cities of Madrid and Barcelona were cancelled due to the flooding, and schools and other essential services were suspended in the worst-hit areas, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emergency services in the region urged citizens to avoid all road travel and to follow further official advice, and a military unit specialised in rescue operations was deployed in some places to help local emergency workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some parts of the region such as the towns of Turis, Chiva or Bunol recorded more than 400 millimetres of rainfall - equivalent to a year of normal rainfall - leading the state weather agency AEMET to declare a red alert on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As rain eased there, the alert was lowered to amber, but with the storm moving in a northeasterly direction, the regional weather service in Catalonia issued a red alert for the area around Barcelona, warning of high winds and hail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will likely rise with other regions yet to report victims and search efforts continuing in areas with difficult access.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming more frequent in Europe due to climate change. Meteorologists think the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mainland authorities on Wednesday said they firmly opposed new rules announced by the US Treasury that will prohibit US-headquartered firms, citizens, and permanent residents from engaging in transactions involving cutting-edge technology with China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The restrictions will take effect on January 2, targeting investments in the fields of semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China firmly opposes the United States issuing final rules on investment restrictions on China and has lodged stern representations with the United States," a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The United States has generalised the concept of national security," the statement said, calling the restrictions a "typical non-market practice".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rules will "damage the interests" of firms in both China and the United States, the statement warned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China "reserves the right to take measures", it added.

   US Treasury assistant secretary for investment security Paul Rosen had said in a statement that the areas targeted by the latest US curbs "are fundamental to the development of the next generation of military, surveillance, intelligence and certain cybersecurity applications".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors will also be required under the rules to inform authorities about investments in some less advanced technologies that could threaten US national security, the department added. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Kamala Harris warned against Donald Trump's bid to seize "unchecked power" in a fiery speech on Tuesday at the spot where her rival riled up a mob before the deadly January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But America, I am here tonight to say: that's not who we are," Harris told a huge crowd of flag-waving supporters against the imposing backdrop of the White House in Washington.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The campaign claimed 75,000 people attended the rally, which comes just a week before the current Democratic vice president faces the Republican former president in the closest and most volatile election of modern times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number could not be immediately verified, but the crowd was unusually big in an election that has already seen heavy enthusiasm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The choice of the Ellipse – a park linking the White House to the vast National Mall – was a direct attempt by her campaign to remind voters of the chaos caused by Trump's attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After Trump urged supporters in a speech there to "fight like hell," many then marched on the Capitol to disrupt the certification of Biden's victory, in an assault that left 140 police officers wounded and shocked the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The choice of venue – the White House lit up against the night in the background – was also a symbolic pitch to show Harris ready for the presidency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking from behind bulletproof screens next to blue signs saying "Freedom," Harris pledged to be a "president for all Americans" – unlike Trump, whom she accused of wanting to jail his enemies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And although her speech began with the dramatic put-down of Trump's behavior, she soon pivoted to a recap of her detailed plans to help financially struggling middle class Americans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She got one of the biggest cheers when she referred to Republicans' drive to curtail abortion, saying the government should not be "telling women what to do with their bodies."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The crowd extended far beyond the Ellipse, across the Mall and all the way up to the iconic Washington Monument obelisk.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although there is almost a week to go, the Harris campaign cast the speech as a "closing argument" – a nod to her career as a prosecutor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think of this as a cleansing for what happened on January 6," said Mitzi Maxwell, 69, who came from Florida with her mother to see "all the love and passion and excitement that she (Harris) has become known for."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some Harris supporters queued for more than seven hours before the speech, whose sheer scale and energy was a direct challenge to Trump, a politician who has always boasted about his ability to draw crowds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As Harris spoke in Washington, Trump visited a heavily Hispanic city in Pennsylvania, two days after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's comments about Puerto Rico drew outrage at the New York rally.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Puerto Ricans are the largest Hispanic group in Pennsylvania, the most crucial battleground state to win as it holds the highest number of Electoral College votes of the seven battleground states, according to the Census Bureau.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I’d like to begin with a very, very simple question: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans," Trump said. (Agencies)

    Israel faces backlash over UN agency ban

  <img alt="UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, has been operating in the Palestinian territories for more than seven decades. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776747_1_20241029213623.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel faced an international backlash on Tuesday after its parliament approved a bill banning the main United Nations aid agency for the devastated Gaza Strip.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite global concerns, including from Israel's ally the United States, lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to ban the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) from working in Israel and annexed east Jerusalem.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   UNRWA has been operating in the Palestinian territories for more than seven decades, and is the largest aid provider in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel controls all humanitarian aid shipments to Gaza, where its forces have been fighting Palestinian militant group Hamas for more than a year. It is unclear how the agency will continue to operate there, and aid groups have warned that there is no immediate replacement for UNRWA.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lawmakers also passed a measure prohibiting Israeli officials from working with UNRWA and its employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel says UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas and that the militant group siphons off aid and uses UN facilities to shield its activities, allegations denied by the UN agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is a deep connection between the terrorist organisation (Hamas) and UNRWA, and Israel cannot put up with it," lawmaker Yuli Edelstein said in parliament as he presented the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several of Israel's Western allies voiced disquiet at the ban, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying Britain was "gravely concerned."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Germany, which has been a staunch defender of Israel's security, warned it would "effectively make UNRWA's work in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem impossible... jeopardising vital humanitarian aid for millions of people."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   James Elder, a spokesperson for the UN children's agency UNICEF, said the suspension of UNRWA's work “would likely see the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said UNICEF “would become effectively unable to distribute lifesaving supplies" such as vaccines, winter clothes, hygiene kits, health kits, water, and ready-to-use therapeutic food to combat malnutrition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   UN chief Antonio Guterres said the Israeli law could have "devastating consequences" if implemented, while UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini warned that the vote "sets a dangerous precedent."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on social media that Israel was "ready" to continue providing aid to Gaza "in a way that does not threaten Israel's security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ban comes as fighting rages in Gaza and Lebanon, where a second full-scale front opened last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. Around 90 percent of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced from their homes, often multiple times. (AP/AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Democratic presidential candidate and US Vice President Kamala Harris will urge Americans to turn the page on Donald Trump as she delivers her closing election argument on Tuesday on the spot where her Republican rival rallied supporters before the January 6, 2021 US Capitol attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With polls in a dead heat one week before Election Day, Harris’ campaign said she chose the symbolic site to push her case that the Republican former president is a threat to American democracy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said in a statement that the former prosecutor would deliver a "major closing argument" and "make the case that it is time to turn the page on Trump and chart a new way forward.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A senior campaign official said Harris will also deliver an "optimistic and hopeful" message, amid rumblings in the party that she is focusing too much on Trump and not enough on her own policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Harris will address some 20,000 people on the Ellipse, a park outside the White House where Trump delivered a fiery speech in which he ramped up his false claims that he won the 2020 election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump supporters then marched on the Capitol to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's victory, in an assault that left at least five people dead and 140 police officers injured.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For his part, Trump, who, at 78, is the oldest presidential candidate in US history, will be trying to take the sting out of Harris' big event by delivering remarks at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He will then rally in blue-collar Allentown in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most crucial of the seven battleground states that are expected to decide the election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump gave his closing arguments at a mass rally at New York's Madison Square Garden at the weekend, where some of the other speakers used language widely condemned as racist and sexist.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both candidates will keep up a punishing schedule in the final days until November 5, sometimes hitting three or more states in one day. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Nato and South Korea have expressed alarm that North Korean troops could soon be joining Moscow's side in the Ukraine-Russia war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato said on Monday thousands of North Korean troops were moving toward the front line, a development which has prompted Kyiv to call for more weapons and an international plan to keep those troops at bay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Western leaders said North Korea has sent some 10,000 soldiers – up from an estimate of 3,000 troops last Wednesday – to help Russia’s military campaign, and warned that its involvement in a European war could also unsettle relations in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan and Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For his part, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had talked with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and told him that 3,000 North Korean soldiers are already at military bases close to the Ukranian front line, and that he expects that deployment to increase to 12,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This war is becoming internationalised, extending beyond two countries," Zelenskiy said on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We agreed to strengthen intelligence and expertise exchange, intensify contacts at all levels, especially the highest, in order to develop an action strategy and countermeasures to address this escalation," Zelensky said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yoon told Zelensky that if North Korea receives aid from Russia and is able to glean military experience and knowledge from its involvement in the war, it would pose a "great threat" to South Korea's security, his office said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea has said it may start supplying weapons to Ukraine if North Korean troops joined Russia's war. Neither Putin nor Pyongyang has denied North Korean troops are in Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Moscow said on Tuesday it had seized the war-battered mining town of Selydove in eastern Ukraine where Kyiv's forces are buckling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moscow also said it had wrested control of the nearby villages of Bogoyavlenka, Girnyk and Katerynivka, also in the Donetsk region, which Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed was formally part of Russia in late 2022, the year Moscow started the war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The gains announced by Moscow on Tuesday are just the latest in a string of Russian advances that have gained momentum since February with the collapse of Ukraine's defences in the stronghold town of Avdiivka.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the same time, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui arrived in Russia's far east on Tuesday on her way to Moscow, Russian state media said. Russian state news agencies said it was not clear who Choe, making her second visit in six weeks, would meet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had no plans to meet her. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Germany and the European Union on Tuesday strongly condemned Iran's execution of a 69-year-old German-Iranian dissident after years behind bars and warned they were considering retaliatory measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Jamshid Sharmahd's execution on Monday a "scandal" and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned Iran's "inhumane regime" of "serious consequences".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi doubled down and poured scorn on her comments, writing on X that "a German passport does not provide impunity to anyone, let alone a terrorist criminal".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Berlin summoned Iran's charge d'affaires to "convey its strong protest" at the execution. The German ambassador in Tehran also protested to the Iranian foreign ministry and was then recalled to Berlin for consultations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Berlin "reserved the right to take further measures", the foreign ministry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said the bloc condemned Sharmahd's "killing in the strongest possible terms" and was also "considering measures in response".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A European Commission spokeswoman told reporters that "any measures" could be taken against Iran and that they "have to be discussed with all member states".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sharmahd, a German citizen of Iranian descent and a US resident, was a software engineer who had worked and written for an Iranian opposition group's website based abroad that strongly criticised the Islamic republic's leadership.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was seized by Iranian authorities in 2020 while travelling through the United Arab Emirates, according to his family.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iran accused him of having played a role in a deadly 2008 mosque bombing. He was sentenced to death in February 2023 for the capital offence of "corruption on Earth".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Iranian judiciary's Mizan website said on Monday that "the death sentence of Jamshid Sharmahd... was carried out this morning".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His family have always vehemently protested his innocence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sharmahd's daughter Gazelle said on X she was waiting for the German and US governments to provide "concrete proof" that her father had been killed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If so, she said, his body should be brought home "immediately" and the Iranian government should face "severe punishment".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A German foreign ministry source said that Baerbock had spoken to Gazelle Sharmahd on Monday "and expressed condolences on behalf of the German government". (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The European Commission on Tuesday said it had finalised discussions with Britain on an agreement that would allow both sides to cooperate directly in antitrust investigations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement is the first that would allow national competition authorities from EU countries to cooperate directly with a competition authority outside the bloc.

   <br/>
   The agreement, which comes into force after both the EU and Britain have finalised their ratification procedures, will set out that important antitrust and merger investigations are brought to each other's attention, the commission said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will also allow the coordination of investigations when necessary and set out the principles of cooperation, to avoid conflicts between jurisdictions. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Steve Bannon, a prominent right-wing figure and former senior advisor to Donald Trump, was released from prison early on Tuesday after spending nearly four months behind bars and just a week ahead of the US election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bannon left a federal prison in Connecticut where he was serving time for a contempt of Congress conviction, several US media outlets reported.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm not broken, I'm empowered," the 70-year-old told the New York Times outside the prison.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bannon was convicted of defying a subpoena to testify before the congressional panel investigating the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When he entered prison on July 1, he defiantly said he was "proud" to serve time "if it's what it takes to stand up to Joe Biden."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Much has changed in US politics since then, with Biden dropping out of the race and Kamala Harris replacing him as the Democratic nominee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bannon played a senior role in Trump's 2016 campaign and later served in the White House as chief strategist, leaving after seven months reportedly due to conflicts with other top staffers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Though he no longer works officially for ex-president, he has continued to use his influence to get him back in the White House, mainly through his podcast "The War Room."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2020, he was charged with wire fraud and money laundering for taking for personal use millions of dollars contributed by donors for the construction of a border wall with Mexico.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While others were found guilty in the scheme, Trump issued a blanket pardon to Bannon before leaving office in January 2021, leading to the dismissal of the charges against him. (AFP)

    Pope's commission against abuse to publish 1st report

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Vatican on Tuesday will publish its first annual report on protecting minors in the Catholic Church, a move requested by Pope Francis amid pressure for more action to tackle clerical child sex abuse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors said its report will be a "first step towards a process of data gathering and reporting", and will document "where risks remain, and where advances can be found".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pope Francis set up the independent panel of experts in December 2014 amid an avalanche of revelations of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy across the world, and its cover-up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the commission has faced strong criticism over its organisation, funding and role, with several high-profile members quitting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2022, Francis incorporated the commission into the Roman Curia – the government of the Holy See – and asked for an annual, "reliable account on what is presently being done and what needs to change".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first of these will be published on Tuesday, launched at the Vatican by the commission's president, US Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the former archbishop of Boston who has spent decades listening to abuse survivors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement ahead of the launch, the commission described the report as a "new tool", part of a process to set out clear standards on protecting children and vulnerable adults.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will be divided into four areas – a review of safeguarding policies in 15 to 20 local churches each year, trends across continents, policies within the Vatican and the Church's broader role in society.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It collects resources and practices to be shared across the Universal Church, and makes specific recommendations to promote further progress in safeguarding," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since becoming pope in March 2013, Francis has taken numerous measures to tackle abuse, from opening up internal Church documents to punishing high-ranking clergy, while making it compulsory to report suspicions of sexual assault to Church authorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But clergy are still not required to report abuse to civil authorities, unless the laws of that country require it, while any revelations made in confession remain private. (AFP)

    Philadelphia prosecutor sues Musk group over giveaways

  <img alt="Election law experts say Elon Musk's giveaway may violate US federal law. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776613_1_20241029032140.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The district attorney of Philadelphia said on Monday that he has filed a lawsuit to halt Elon Musk's US$1 million giveaways as part of his political organisation's effort boosting Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The suit by Democratic District Attorney Larry Krasner is the first legal action to be brought over the sweepstakes offering US$1 million every day until November 5 to a person in a battleground state who has signed a petition supporting the Constitution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Krasner's office said the lawsuit, coming just over a week before Election Day, doesn't preclude potential criminal action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The Philadelphia District Attorney is charged with protecting the public from public nuisances and unfair trade practices, including illegal lotteries. The DA is also charged with protecting the public from interference with the integrity of elections,” Krasner's office said in a statement published on its website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A spokesperson for the billionaire tech mogul's America PAC (political action committee), emailed for comment on the lawsuit and asked if the cash awards would continue, responded with a link to an X post, which showed the latest US$1 million winner holding an oversized check.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking in Delaware after casting his ballot Monday, US President Joe Biden called the giveaway “totally inappropriate.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Musk's giveaway requires entrants to sign a petition backing the First and Second Amendments of the Constitution and calls for them to serve as spokespeople for the organization as a condition of winning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The awards have carried on after election law experts raised questions that it violates federal law barring anyone from paying a person to vote or register to vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his statement announcing the lawsuit, Krasner characterised the US$1 million prize as a “lottery,” which would make it more heavily regulated than if it were a prize or work-related. (AP)

    Thousands protest in Georgia after disputed vote

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tens of thousands of Georgians massed outside parliament on Monday night, demanding the annulment of the weekend parliamentary election that the president denounced as rigged with the help of Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rally deepened the political crisis in the South Caucasus country, where the governing Georgian Dream party has become increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “You did not lose the election,” President Salome Zourabichvili told the demonstrators who waved Georgian and European Union flags. “They stole your vote and tried to steal your future, but no one has the right to do that and you will not let anyone do that!”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giorgi Vashadze, leader of United National Movement coalition, said the opposition won't take part in any talks with the government and push for a new vote under international supervision.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are not going to enter this parliament. We refuse all mandates,” he said. “We are not going to enter into any negotiations. We are going to fight until victory and we promise you, we will definitely win together.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Natia Chachava, who was wrapped in the Georgian flag, said the demonstrators “don’t want Russia, we don’t want to back to Russia or back to the Soviet Union.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU, the United States and NATO have all called for a full investigation of alleged irregularities in the Georgian election on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Georgian Dream and the electoral commission said the vote was free and fair.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Central Election Commission said the Georgian Dream party received 54.8 percent of the vote with almost all ballots counted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Kremlin on Monday denied any Russian interference in the vote, saying it was the West, not Moscow, that was trying to destabilise the situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We aren’t meddling in Georgia’s internal affairs, and we have no intention of meddling,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He countered that it was the West that had tried to influence the vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Parliament speaker Shalva Papuashvili, a member of Georgian Dream, accused the president of creating “a coup scenario” that goes “against the constitutional order and democratic elections.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely because of a Russian-style “foreign influence law” passed in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many Georgians viewed Saturday’s vote as a pivotal referendum on the opportunity to join the EU. (Agencies)

    Starmer takes on critics as tax rises loom

  <img alt="Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaks during an event in Birmingham. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776600_1_20241028220117.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said taxes needed to rise to rebuild public services and fix the foundations of the economy, and challenged critics to spell out how they would tackle the country's "unprecedented" problems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Wednesday, finance minister Rachel Reeves will set out her first tax and spending plans which must address a difficult fiscal picture without raising major taxes on workers, cutting spending in priority departments or spooking investors with excessive borrowing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starmer, whose Labour Party won a landslide election victory in July, said in a speech on Monday that tough trade-offs were needed to "fix the foundations" of the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be realistic about where we are as a country... These are unprecedented circumstances," he said, noting his government, unlike its predecessors in 1997 and 2010, had to deal with both a weak economy and poor public services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But I won't offer it as an excuse. I expect to be judged on my ability to deal with this," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Labour would borrow to drive growth and increase taxes to "prevent austerity and rebuild public services", he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government is looking to find around 40 billion pounds in tax rises and spending cuts to address the fiscal gap while putting more money into areas like health and education.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starmer said he rejected the "fiction you can lower taxes (and) spend more on public services without making any changes".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shortly after the election, Reeves said the fiscal situation was worse than thought due to a 22 billion-pound (US$28.5 billion) black hole she said she had inherited from the previous Conservative government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves has said she will change the definition of public debt in the government's fiscal rules to allow it to borrow more to invest in the hope of speeding up economic growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to move to a situation where we invest in the future of this country," Starmer said. "I do not accept the proposition that it will have an impact on interest rates."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said 240 million pounds would be spent on helping people back into work, and a two pound cap on bus fares would be replaced by a three pound cap next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Much of the build-up to the budget has been dominated by a debate over the definition of "working people".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government has pledged not to raise social security contributions paid by employees, but critics say working people might still bear the cost if the government increases the contributions paid by employers instead, or raises taxes on their savings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starmer said he was prepared to have a debate about the definition of working people but his chief concern was that there was "no more tax in their payslip."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Conservatives have challenged the new government's assessment of the public finances, saying they are a pretext for tax rises that Labour had been planning already. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The social media network X on Monday suspended an account that published Hebrew-language messages on behalf of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, just days after it was opened.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The account had a short notice reading "X suspends accounts which violate the X Rules," though the Elon Musk-owned platform did not specify which rule had been violated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Khamenei's office runs several social network accounts in his name, broadcasting messages in different languages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hebrew-language account had launched on the weekend with a message that is a common greeting in the Islamic world: "In the name of Allah, the Benevolent, the Most Merciful."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was opened after Israel carried out air strikes against military sites in Iran on Saturday in response to Tehran's missile attack on October 1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least four Iranian soldiers were killed in the attack which Iran said caused "limited damage" to a few radar systems. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The trial of French actor Gerard Depardieu on sexual assault charges opened on Monday in the absence of the celebrity, who had declared himself to be ill.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His lawyer, Jeremie Assous, had said earlier that Depardieu, 75, was "extremely affected" by ill health, and that he had asked for proceedings to be delayed until he could attend in person.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Unfortunately his doctors have forbidden him from appearing here today," the lawyer said on arrival for the trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said would ask the court for a six-month suspension of the trial, which comes after numerous other complaints and with a possible second court case already lying in wait.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The actor is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's version of the #MeToo movement, triggered in 2017 by allegations against US producer Harvey Weinstein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Depardieu faces charges of abuse that allegedly occurred during a 2021 film shoot. The names of the two women accusing him have not been made public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of the plaintiffs, a set dresser now aged 55, reported in February that she had suffered sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults while filming director Jean Becker's "Les Volet Verts" ("The Green Shutters") in a private house in Paris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I expect the justice system to be the same for everybody and for monsieur Depardieu not to receive special treatment just because he's an artist," the plaintiff's lawyer Carine Durrieu-Diebolt told AFP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Assous said that Depardieu's defence would offer "witnesses and evidence that will show he has simply been targeted by false accusations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He accused the plaintiff of attempting to "make money" by claiming 30,000 euros (US$32,500) in compensation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plaintiff told French investigative website Mediapart that Depardieu had started loudly calling for a cooling fan during the shoot because he "couldn't even get it up" in the heat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She claimed the actor went on to boast that he could "give women an orgasm without touching them".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plaintiff alleged that an hour later she was "brutally grabbed" by Depardieu as she was walking off the set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The actor pinned her by "closing his legs" around her before groping her waist and her stomach, continuing up to her breasts, she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Depardieu made "obscene remarks" during the incident, she said, including: "Come and touch my big parasol. I'll stick it in your pussy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She described the actor's bodyguards dragging him away as he shouted: "We'll see each other again, my dear".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My client expects that the justice system will find Gerard Depardieu to be a serial sexual assaulter," Durrieu-Diebolt said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second plaintiff in Monday's case, an assistant director on the same film, also alleges sexual violence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anouk Grinberg, an actor who appeared in "The Green Shutters", told AFP that Depardieu had used "salacious words... from morning till night".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When producers hired Depardieu to work on a film, they knew they were hiring an assaulter," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Grinberg said that in her experience, Depardieu had "always used sexual, smutty language" -- but that his behaviour had become "much, much worse, with permission from his profession, that pays him for it and covers up his offences".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 20 women have now accused Depardieu of various sexual offences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Actor Charlotte Arnould was the first to file a criminal complaint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A judge has yet to rule on a request from prosecutors in August for Depardieu to stand trial for raping and sexually assaulting her.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An investigation is also underway in Paris after a former production assistant accused Depardieu of a 2014 sexual assault.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And actor Helene Darras filed a sexual assault complaint that fell foul of the statute of limitations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spanish writer and journalist Ruth Baza has accused Depardieu of raping her in 1995.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Never, but never, have I abused a woman," Depardieu wrote in an open letter published in conservative daily Le Figaro in October last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Weeks later, President Emmanuel Macron shocked feminists by complaining of a "manhunt" targeting Depardieu, who he called a "towering actor" who "makes France proud".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Macron's remarks followed the broadcast by an investigative TV show of a recording of Depardieu making repeated misogynistic and insulting remarks about women.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Depardieu is the biggest star to face accusations in French cinema's #MeToo movement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Directors Jacques Doillon and Benoit Jacquot are among the other major figures accused of sexual violence. (AFP)

    Agitator Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A UK judge on Monday jailed far-right agitator Tommy Robinson for 18 months after he admitted committing contempt of court over a long-running libel case involving a Syrian refugee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sentence is the latest jail term for one of Britain's most prominent anti-Muslim activists, who is blamed for helping fuel anti-immigration riots earlier this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It came after Robinson -- whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon -- pleaded guilty earlier on Monday to 10 breaches of a 2021 High Court order.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It bars the 41-year-old far-right figurehead from repeating false allegations he had made about the Syrian refugee, who successfully sued him for libel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Handing down the 18-month jail sentence at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London, judge Jeremy Johnson said Robinson's actions were a "planned, deliberate, direct, flagrant breach of the court's orders".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Nobody is above the law. Nobody can pick and choose which injunctions they obey and those they do not," the judge added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is in the interests of the whole community that injunctions are obeyed."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Robinson, wearing a grey suit and waistcoat with no tie, was held in custody, as some of his supporters looked on in court.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had turned himself in to police on Friday, after an arrest warrant was issued following his failure to appear for a July court hearing on the case.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lawyers for the Solicitor General, a senior government post advising on legal matters and which pursues such cases, said during the hearing that Robinson had been "thumbing his nose at the court".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It accused him of "undermining" the rule of law, including by last year helping to publish a film called "Silenced", which contains the libellous allegations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The film remains pinned to the top of Robinson's profile on the social media site X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former football hooligan, who helped form the now-defunct far-right English Defence League in 2009, had landed himself back in court because of his "principles", his lawyers argued.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Robinson, who brands himself as a free speech advocate, has previously served time for contempt of court, which is not a crime but can be sanctioned with a jail term.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also has several criminal convictions, including for assault.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, thousands of his supporters and other protesters marched through central London demanding his release, as well as tougher immigration laws.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Robinson, who has reportedly spent recent months outside the UK, has amassed a large online following built around his vehemently anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant messaging.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Demonstrators at anti-immigrant riots which erupted across England and Northern Ireland in late July and early August could be heard chanting his name.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was widely condemned for a stream of social media posts during the week of violence, which was sparked by false rumours that the suspect behind the fatal stabbings of three young girls was a Muslim asylum seeker.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has been a familiar sight at far-right rallies over the years, but has seen his profile grow over the last year after his X account was reinstated following billionaire Elon Musk's purchase of the platform. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said on Sunday that “no one can sit on the sidelines” in this year's presidential election, capping a day of campaigning across the largest city in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are focused on the future and we are focused on the needs of the American people," Harris said, "as opposed to Donald Trump, who spends full time looking in the mirror focused on himself.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a city recreation centre, the US Vice President singled out young voters, praising them for being “rightly impatient for change," and told the audience that “there is too much at stake” in the campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We must not wake up the day after the election and have any regret about what we could have done in these next nine days," Harris said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Energising voters in Philadelphia, a traditional Democratic stronghold, is crucial for Harris’ chances of beating Republican presidential candidate Trump.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If turnout falls short here, she will struggle to overcome her opponent's advantages in the state's rural areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Trump hosted a rally featuring crude and racist insults at New York’s Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With just over a week before Election Day, speakers at the New York rally labelled Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” and called Harris “the devil”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” said Tony Hinchcliffe, a stand-up comic whose set also included lewd and racist comments about Latinos, Jews and Black people, all key constituencies in the election just nine days away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His joke was immediately criticised by Harris’ campaign as it competes with Trump to win over Puerto Rican communities in Pennsylvania and other swing states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Puerto Rican music superstar Bad Bunny backed Harris shortly after Hinchcliffe's appearance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The normally pugnacious Trump campaign took the rare step of distancing itself from Hinchcliffe. “
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign," senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But other speakers also made incendiary comments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump’s childhood friend David Rem referred to Harris as “the Antichrist” and “the devil" while businessman Grant Cardone told the crowd that Harris' handlers "will destroy our country.” (AP)

    LDP heavyweight resigns after Japan election drubbing

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The election committee chief of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) resigned on Monday after the party suffered its worst result since 2009, a party official said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of a former prime minister, submitted a letter of resignation, the official said, with media reports quoting him as saying he wanted to "take responsibility" for the result.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s ruling coalition lost a majority in the 465-seat lower house in a snap parliamentary election held on Sunday, a punishment by voters' outrage over the governing party’s extensive financial scandals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba's LDP remains the top party in Japan's parliament, and a change of government is not expected. But the results create political uncertainty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Falling short of a majority makes it difficult for Ishiba to get his party’s policies through parliament, and he may need to find a third coalition partner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP’s coalition retains a majority in the less powerful upper house.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All told, the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held, according to Japanese media.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba took office on October 1 and immediately ordered the election in hopes of shoring up support after his predecessor, Fumio Kishida , failed to address public outrage over the LDP’s scandals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The results so far have been extremely severe, and we take them very seriously," Ishiba told Japan's national NHK television late Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I believe the voters are telling us to reflect more and become a party that lives up to their expectations."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba said the LDP would still lead a ruling coalition and tackle key policies, compile a planned supplementary budget and pursue political reform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He indicated that his party is open to cooperating with opposition groups if that suits the public's expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda, made huge gains to 148 seats, from its previous 98.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We accomplished our goal of preventing the ruling coalition from a majority, which was a major achievement,” Noda said. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Philippines raised a fresh weather alert on Monday, days after more than 100 people were killed by the country’s worst storm of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nearly a million people are still sheltering at evacuation centres or with relatives after losing their homes or being driven out by floodwaters brought by Severe Tropical Storm Trami, which struck from October 22.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The country's weather agency says Tropical Storm Kong-rey will strengthen into a typhoon by Tuesday and pass close to the northern Philippines as early as Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lowest of a five-stage storm alert is in place on the country's northeast coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, by contrast, struck some of the country's most populous areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government's disaster agency put the death toll from Trami at 116, with 39 missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Philippines or its surrounding waters each year, damaging homes and infrastructure and killing dozens of people. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's ruling coalition has lost its majority after snap elections, Japanese media projected early on Monday, in what would be a major blow to new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba, 67, called Sunday's election only days after taking office on October 1, aiming to bolster his position and that of his scandal-hit Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost continuously for seven decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But national broadcaster NHK and other media outlets reported in the hours after polls closed that the LDP – in the party's worst result since 2009 – together with its long-term junior coalition partner Komeito had fallen short of the 233 seats needed for a majority in Japan's lower house.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Voters in the world's fourth-largest economy have been rankled by rising prices and the fallout from a party slush fund scandal that helped sink previous premier Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP remains the top party in Japan's parliament, and a change of government is not expected. But the results create political uncertainty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Falling short of a majority makes it difficult for Ishiba to get his party’s policies through parliament, and he may need to find a third coalition partner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP’s coalition retains a majority in the less powerful upper house. Public broadcaster NHK reported that the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are receiving severe judgement," Ishiba told NHK earlier on Sunday while it was still unclear whether the coalition would secure enough seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Voters "expressed their strong desire for the LDP to do some reflection and become a party that will act in line with the people's will," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Footage from the LDP headquarters showed gloomy faces as projections based on exit polls indicated Ishiba's justice and agriculture ministers were likely to lose their seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda, made huge gains to 148 seats, from its previous 98.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We accomplished our goal of preventing the ruling coalition from a majority, which was a major achievement,” Noda said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noda called the election a rare chance for a change of government, and said he seeks to lead a coalition with other opposition groups to do so. But his party has had trouble finding partners, and some voters were skeptical about the opposition’s ability and inexperience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Ishiba, potential additional partners include the Democratic Party of the People, which calls for lower taxes, and the conservative Japan Innovation Party.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   DPP head Yuichiro Tamaki said he was open to “a partial alliance.” Innovation Party chief Nobuyuki Baba has denied any intention to cooperate. As of early Monday, DPP had 28 seats and the Innovation Party 38.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Experts say a CDPJ-led government is not in the picture because of its lack of viable policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “If they take power and try to change the economic and diplomatic policies of the current government, they will only end up collapsing right away,” said Izuru Makihara, a University of Tokyo professor of politics and public policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Realistically, Ishiba's ruling coalition would seek a partnership with either the Innovation Party or the Democratic Party of the People”, he said. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Georgian opposition on Sunday called for protests and the European Union demanded an investigation into "irregularities" after a disputed legislative vote that showed a win for the ruling party.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pro-Western President Salome Zurabishvili accused Moscow of being behind the alleged election fraud, calling it a "Russian special operation".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Amid angry opposition claims over the result, Zurabishvili called for a rally on Monday. Jailed former president Mikheil Saakashvili also called for mass protests.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Union had warned that Saturday's vote could determine Tbilisi's chances of joining the bloc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   EU council president Charles Michel wrote on X that Georgian authorities should "swiftly, transparently and independently investigate and adjudicate electoral irregularities and allegations thereof.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These alleged irregularities must be seriously clarified and addressed," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After meeting with opposition leaders in Tbilisi, Zurabishvili said there had been a "total falsification of the election".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are witnesses and victims of a Russian special operation, a modern form of hybrid war against the Georgian people," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   International observers said Saturday's election was "marred by an uneven playing field, pressure and tension". An EU parliament mission also expressed concern about "democratic backsliding", saying it had seen instances of "ballot box stuffing" and the "physical assault" of observers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saakashvili said on Facebook that opposition lawmakers should renounce their parliamentary seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Now is the time for mass protests. We must show the world that we are fighting for freedom and that we are a people who will not tolerate injustice," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official tallies from more than 99 percent of precincts showed the ruling Georgian Dream party winning 54 percent of the vote, with the main pro-Western opposition coalition on 37.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The result gives Georgian Dream 91 seats in the 150-member parliament – enough to govern but short of the supermajority it had sought to pass a constitutional ban on all main opposition parties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our victory is impressive," Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said in a statement, accusing the opposition of "undermining the country's constitutional order" by questioning his party's victory. (AFP)

    Iran mulls response as Israel says it hit Iran hard

  <img alt="Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says Israel's attack on Iran should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel's airstrikes "hit hard" Iran's defences and missile production, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, as Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the country was considering its response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With warfare raging in Gaza and Lebanon, direct confrontation between Israel and Iran risks spiralling into a regional conflagration. But a day after the airstrikes, there was no sign they would spark another round of escalation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, heavy fighting in Lebanon between Israeli forces and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which sharply intensified over recent weeks, continued on Sunday with an Israeli airstrike killing eight people in a residential block in Sidon, medics said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The air force attacked throughout Iran. We hit hard Iran's defence capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed at us," Netanyahu said in a speech, calling the attack "precise and powerful" and saying it met all its objectives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel’s army chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said the strike on Iran had showed what the Israeli response to its enemies would be.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We struck strategic systems in Iran, which carries great importance, and we will now see how things develop. We are prepared for all scenarios in every arena.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Islamic Republic has not signalled how it will respond to Saturday's long-anticipated strikes, which involved scores of fighter jets bombing targets near the capital Tehran and in the western provinces of Ilam and Khuzestan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The heavily armed arch-enemies have engaged in a cycle of retaliatory moves against each other for months, with Saturday's strike coming after an Iranian missile barrage on Oct 1, much of which Israel said was downed by its air defences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Khamenei said Israel's calculations "should be disrupted".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack on Iran, which killed four soldiers and caused some damage, "should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated", he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   ranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran was not looking for war but would give an "appropriate response".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US President Joe Biden called for a halt to escalation, which has raised fears of a wider Middle East war arising from the year-old Israeli-Hamas conflict in Gaza and Israel's thrust into south Lebanon to stop Hezbollah rocketing northern Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Iran was no longer able to use its allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon against Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The two groups "are no longer an effective tool" of Tehran, he said in a speech.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gallant added that Hamas was no longer functioning as a military network in Gaza and that Hezbollah's senior command and most of its missile capabilities had been eliminated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hamas has repeatedly said it is still able to function militarily, and Israel has recently conducted major new operations in devastated north Gaza against what it calls regrouping Hamas militants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah has said its command structure remains intact and that it retains significant missile capabilities. (Reuters)

  <img alt="Evo Morales is vying for the nomination of the ruling party in August 2025 presidential elections. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776469_1_20241028013441.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former Bolivian president Evo Morales said gunmen fired a hail of bullets at his car Sunday as he travelled to a radio interview in the central city of Cochabamba, wounding his driver.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The car in which I arrived has 14 bullet holes," said Morales, adding: "This was planned. The idea was to kill Evo."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The radio station that hosted the interview, Kawsachun Coca, released a video that it said was of the bullet-ridden pickup truck that Morales had been in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The windshield had three bullet holes and the driver had blood on his head.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales blamed the current president, Luis Arce, a former ally and cabinet minister of his with whom he has fallen out, for the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Lucho has destroyed Bolivia and now he wants to eliminate our process by killing Evo," Morales, using the president's nickname, said of his own attempt to regain the presidency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales, a former coca grower who is now 65, served as president from 2006 until 2019. He was highly popular in the Andean country until he tried to bypass the constitution to seek a fourth term.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was forced to resign after losing the support of the military following an election marked by allegations of fraud, and fled to Mexico.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales returned to Bolivia in 2020 seeking political resurrection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He and Arce are both vying for the nomination of the ruling MAS party in August 2025 presidential elections, although Morales is legally barred from running again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales is being investigated for rape, human trafficking and human smuggling over his alleged sexual relationship with a 15-year-old member of his political youth guard in 2015.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Supporters of Morales have protested by blocking major roads throughout the country for two weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, the government had criticised Morales for "destabilising" the country with two weeks of road blockades that have jammed up supplies of food and fuel around the country. It accused him of trying to "interrupt democratic order".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government in a statement also said some groups allied to Morales were armed and warned about violence, citing 14 police officers wounded trying to break up the blockades. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's ruling coalition may fall short of a parliamentary majority, exit polls for Sunday's general election showed, raising uncertainty over the make-up of the government of the world's fourth-largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll by national broadcaster NHK showed the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan for almost all of its post-war history, and junior coalition partner were set to win between 174 and 254 of the 465 seats in the lower house of Japan's parliament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan is predicted to win 128 to 191 seats. The outcome may force the LDP or CDPJ into power-sharing agreements with other parties to form a government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll by Nippon TV showed the ruling coalition would win 198 seats to the CDPJ's 157, both well short of the 233 seats needed to reach a majority, as voters punished Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's party over a funding scandal and inflation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a tough fight for the LDP," Shinjiro Koizumi, the LDP's election chief, told NHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba called the snap poll immediately after being elected to head the party last month, hoping to win a public mandate for his premiership. His predecessor Fumio Kishida quit after his support cratered due to anger over a cost of living crunch and a scandal involving unrecorded donations to lawmakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The uncertainty comes nine days before U.S. voters choose a new president and as Japan faces economic headwinds and increasingly tense relations with neighbouring China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP has held an outright majority since it returned to power in 2012 after a brief spell of CDPJ rule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Political wrangling could roil markets and be a headache for the Bank of Japan, if Ishiba chooses a partner that favours maintaining near-zero interest rates when the central bank wants to gradually raise them.
   <br/>

   Japanese shares fell 2.7% last week on the benchmark Nikkei index. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A truck driver rammed his vehicle into a crowd of people at a bus stop in central Israel on Sunday, injuring at least 24 people before he was "shot and neutralised", police said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Preliminary police findings showed the driver also hit a bus that had stopped at the same location to drop off passengers, the police said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least 24 people were injured in the incident, police said, without clarifying whether it was an attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The force however said civilians at the site of the incident "shot the truck driver and neutralised him".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier on Sunday the Magen David Adom emergency service said the incident occurred at Aharon Yariv Boulevard in Ramat HaSharon, north of the commercial hub Tel Aviv.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Of those injured, at least 16 people had been transported to nearby hospitals, MDA said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers and ambulances rushed to the scene, where Israeli television channels showed police cordoning off the area as medics helped the injured and a helicopter hovered above.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident comes as Israel holds ceremonies to mark the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the Hamas attack on October 7 last year that sparked the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mining giants BHP and Vale have signed a deal with Brazil's government to pay nearly US$30 billion in damages for a 2015 dam collapse that triggered the country's worst environmental disaster.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the signing of the deal over the November 5, 2015 collapse of a tailings dam at a mine in the southeastern town of Mariana, which triggered a giant mudslide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The river of mud swamped villages, rivers and rainforest, killing 19 people on its way to the sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope the mining companies have learned their lesson: it would have cost them less to prevent (the disaster), much less," Lula said at the ceremony attended by representatives of Brazil's Vale and Australia's BHP, co-owners of the Brazilian company Samarco that operated the iron mine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement, which Lula declared to be the biggest environmental payout in modern history, comes on the fifth day of a separate mega-trial in London over BHP's role in the dam's failure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than 620,000 complainants, including 46 Brazilian municipalities and several Indigenous communities, are seeking an estimated 36 billion pounds (US$47 million) in damages in the civil trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP denies responsibility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company said on Friday that the agreement reached in Brasilia did not end the lawsuits pending against the companies, nor prevent others being taken.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dam's failure released a torrent of over 40 million cubic meters of highly toxic sludge, the equivalent of 12,000 Olympic swimming pools, which coursed through the Doce River all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, over 600 kilometres away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 600 people were left homeless.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scientists say the mouth of the Doce River and parts of the southeast Atlantic coastline are still contaminated with metals from the spill, affecting the area's population of fish, birds, turtles, porpoises and whales.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP and Vale had already agreed in 2016 to pay 20 billion reais (about US$3.5 billion at today's rate) in damages, but the negotiations were reopened in 2021 due to what the government called their "non-compliance" and the slow progress of Brazil's justice system in resolving the dispute.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Finance ministers of the G7 nations vowed on Saturday to step up efforts to prevent Russia from evading sanctions imposed over the war with Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We remain committed to taking further initiatives in response to oil price cap violations," the group said in a statement following a meeting in Washington. Those further steps were not spelled out in detail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In December 2022, the G7 together with the European Union and Australia agreed to pressure purchasers of Russian oil to not go above a certain price ceiling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement was intended to limit Russian petroleum sales and revenues without curbing exports so sharply that it would cause global oil prices to soar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But some countries have continued to import Russian crude oil without observing the price ceiling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7 finance ministers also said they would take additional measures aimed at "increasing the costs to Russia of using the shadow fleet to evade sanctions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials say Russia has used its fleet of shadow tankers, many of them old, unmarked and poorly maintained, to skirt sanctions by transporting oil without properly declaring their cargo or itineraries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tankers sometimes load or transfer their cargo at sea to avoid unwanted attention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States and the EU have sanctioned several of these ships and their owners, notably Russia's government-owned maritime company Sovcomflot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7 ministers said they intended "to intensify our efforts to prevent financial institutions from supporting Russia's evasion of our sanctions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, Russian financial institutions have developed a network of foreign subsidiaries to facilitate the purchase or sale of sanctioned goods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Joining the G7 ministers in the meeting on Saturday were the heads of the seven countries' central banks, plus top officials of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7, which groups seven of the world's most advanced economies, announced on Friday it had reached an agreement to provide a loan of around US$50 billion to Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The loan will be repaid not by Ukraine but with the interest -- roughly US$3 billion a year -- generated by Russian assets seized and frozen after the war began in February 2022. (AFP)

    Death toll from Trami approaches 100 in Philippines

  <img alt="Vast swathes of the Bicol region in the northern Philippines remain under water and many people are still missing or stranded. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776364_1_20241026201337.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rescuers in the Philippines raced on Saturday to reach people still stranded in areas made inaccessible by flooding from Tropical Storm Trami, which has killed at least 97 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami battered the main island of Luzon and forced nearly half a million people to flee their homes as heavy rain caused widespread floods and landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the hardest-hit Bicol region, residents trapped on the roofs and upper floors of their homes were still awaiting desperately needed assistance, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The floods have yet to subside. Calls asking for help are still pouring in," said Bicol regional police director Andre Dizon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We need to rescue them as soon as possible because starvation can be a problem. We're hearing reports that children are already getting sick."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the region's Camarines Sur province, food and drinking water were in increasingly short supply as some areas remained completely submerged and difficult to access, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Ferdinand Marcos visited the province on Saturday to inspect the damage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our main problem here is that many areas are still flooded," he told government officials during a briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have flood control systems but the amount of water is unmanageable. This is climate change. This is all new, so we have to come up with new solutions too," Marcos added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami's death toll rose on Saturday as rescuers retrieved more bodies from floodwaters and landslide sites, mostly from the Bicol region and Batangas province, south of Manila.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police have recorded 36 deaths in Bicol, most due to drowning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number of confirmed dead in Batangas has risen to 54, provincial police chief Jacinto Malinao said, with at least 21 people missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two were reported dead in separate incidents of electrocution and drowning in Cavite province, police said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Five more deaths have been confirmed in other provinces, bringing the total to 97, according to a tally based on official police and disaster agency sources.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Batangas, two hours south of the capital, rescuers were using backhoes and shovels to dig through mud as high as three metres in a desperate search for the missing in areas hit by landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cadaver-sniffing dogs have also been deployed to assist the operations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reporters who visited the province on Friday saw roads blocked by felled trees, vehicles half-submerged in mud and homes severely damaged by flash flooding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are still hoping for the best," said Malinao, the police chief.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will not stop until all bodies are retrieved."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The national disaster agency said on Saturday that about 495,000 people have been displaced by the flooding, which has submerged hundreds of villages in swathes of the northern Philippines. (AFP)

   A suicide bomber detonated at a checkpoint in western Pakistan on Saturday, killing eight people and wounding five more, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bomber set off the blast from the back of a motorbike rickshaw near the town of Mir Ali in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a local police officer said on condition of anonymity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four police officers were killed alongside two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians in the attack near the border with Afghanistan, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan has seen an increase in militancy since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in 2021, with Islamabad claiming hostile groups are now using the neighbouring country for shelter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Among the five injured personnel, the condition of three is critical, and they have been transferred to a local military hospital," the police officer said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A local government official who also did not want to be named confirmed the same toll of dead and wounded.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack was claimed by a little-known militant group calling itself "Aswad ul-Harb."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another checkpost near the Afghan border was raided this week by the Pakistani Taliban, killing 10 police officers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year, the country saw more suicide attacks than any year since 2014, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were 29 suicide attacks registered, killing 329 people in Pakistan's deadliest year in a decade. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776361_1_20241026191325.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   At least 50 people have been killed in a single attack by Sudanese paramilitaries who have besieged and raided villages in al-Jazira state, activists said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been at war with Sudan's regular army since April 2023 but have in recent days intensified their violence against civilians in al-Jazira, south of the capital Khartoum, after their commander in the state defected to the army.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The villages of al-Sariha and Azraq have been under attack" since Friday morning, the resistance committee in Hasaheisa, one of the hundreds of volunteer groups coordinating aid in Sudan, said in a statement late on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In al-Sariha alone, the attack killed 50 and wounded more than 200, the resistance committee added, reporting a total "inability to evacuate the wounded from the village due to the shelling and snipers" from the RSF.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a near-total communications blackout, tolls are impossible to verify and often hard to gather.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The resistance committee said that the nearby village of Azraq had been placed under a "total siege, suffering the same violations as al-Sariha," although it was not possible to provide a death toll.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the Sudanese doctors' union called on the United Nations to press for safe humanitarian corridors into villages that "are facing genocide at the hands of the Rapid Support militia."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The doctors' union added that rescue operations had become impossible and that "the army is incapable of protecting civilians."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to medical sources in several villages, nearly all health facilities capable of receiving emergency cases have been forced shut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates of 150,000 dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It has also caused what the UN calls the world's largest displacement crisis, with more than seven million uprooted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In June, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States ambassador to the UN, said Sudan is the planet's "largest humanitarian crisis."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Famine was declared in July in the Zamzam camp for displaced people near the town of El-Fasher, in Sudan's western Darfur region bordering Chad.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last Sunday the army announced that the RSF's al-Jazira commander Abu Aqla Kaykal had abandoned the paramilitaries, bringing "a large number of his forces" with him, in what it said was the first high-profile defection to its side.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Activists reported at least 20 people killed in subsequent paramilitary attacks in eastern al-Jazira. They also said an air strike by the Sudanese Armed forces on a mosque in the state capital, Wad Madani, killed 31 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, neighbouring Chad denied helping to arm the paramilitaries after the governor of Sudan's Darfur region, Minni Minnawi, accused them of doing so.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Chad has no interest in amplifying the war in Sudan," said Chadian Foreign Minister Abderaman Koulamallah, pointing out that Chad was "one of the rare countries upon which this war has had major repercussions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sudanese authorities have previously charged that Chad was facilitating the delivery of weapons from the United Arab Emirates to Sudan, which both Chad and the UAE have denied.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The International Monetary Fund's director for Africa, Catherine Pattillo, said this week that the war in Sudan was likely to cause heavy economic damage to its already struggling neighbours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "And then to be confronted with the refugees, the security issues, the trade issues, is very challenging for their growth," she said. (AFP)

    Commonwealth says 'time has come' for talks on slavery

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The 56-member Commonwealth agreed the "time has come" for discussions about the legacy of the "abhorrent" transatlantic slave trade on Saturday, in a landmark joint statement that raised the prospect of future reparations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gathering for a summit in Samoa, leaders held lengthy and occasionally tense talks over one of the most sensitive aspects of their shared and troubled past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bloc brings together Britain and most of its former colonies, many of which are still scarred by the brutal trade that saw an estimated 10-15 million slaves ripped from Africa over four centuries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   African, Caribbean and Pacific nations have pressed for Britain – and other European powers – to pay financial compensation for slavery, or to make political amends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a closing statement, Commonwealth leaders noted calls for "reparatory justice" for the "abhorrent" transatlantic trade and agreed that "the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Britain and other colonial powers have occasionally apologised for slavery in broad terms, they have baulked at the idea of paying financial reparations, which could come with a hefty price tag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the summit, London tried to avoid making explicit commitments, while trying to prove the Commonwealth was still relevant and could work together.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The meeting's conclusion was delayed for hours as leaders and officials tried to hammer out a compromise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That compromise text may stop short of what some former colonies wanted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The time has come to have a real dialogue about how we address these historical wrongs," Prime Minister Philip Davis of the Bahamas told the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The horrors of slavery left a deep, generational wound in our communities, and the fight for justice and reparatory justice is far from over."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But experts said the summit could be historic nonetheless.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The commitment to conversations on reparatory justice wedges open the door for dialogue," said Kingsley Abbott, of the University of London's Institute of Commonwealth Studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Commonwealth" he said, "should see this as an opportunity to lead on a potentially historic process, and to do so with vision and courage."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Britain – still staking out its place in the world after empire and leaving the European Union – the summit had high stakes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the delegates were Prime Minister Keir Starmer and King Charles, his first summit as monarch and as head of the Commonwealth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The British royal, whose family benefited from the slave trade over centuries, had faced calls to apologise personally.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stopped well short of that on Friday, asking delegates to "reject the language of division."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I understand, from listening to people across the Commonwealth, how the most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "None of us can change the past. But we can commit, with all our hearts, to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right inequalities that endure."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Charles left to return to London before the final summit communique had been agreed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Commonwealth leaders found more common cause on the "existential" issue of climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They agreed to an "Ocean Declaration," which recognises national maritime boundaries even if sea levels continue to rise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They also agreed to protect at least 30 percent of the ocean and to restore at least 30 percent of degraded marine ecosystems by 2030.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What the ocean declaration seems to do and to say is that once your marine boundaries are fixed, they are fixed in perpetuity," said outgoing Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Patricia Scotland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Commonwealth leaders also agreed to name Ghana's foreign minister Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey as the new secretary general.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A former lawmaker, she has served as foreign minister for the past seven years, notably steering Ghana's two-year tenure on the UN Security Council, ending December 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She has backed the drafting of a free trade agreement among Commonwealth member states and has previously said she stands for reparations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Truly humbled by the overwhelming support of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in selecting me as the incoming Secretary-General of the Commonwealth" she posted on social media.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The work indeed lies ahead!" (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Candidates in Japan's super-tight election made last-ditch appeals to voters on Saturday, with opinion polls suggesting the ruling coalition might fall short of a majority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Such a bombshell outcome in Sunday's vote would be the worst result for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) since 2009, and potentially a knockout blow to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba – a fan of trains, 1970s pop idols and making model ships and planes – only last month took the helm of the LDP, which has governed Japan for almost all of the past seven decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a tough internal contest, the 67-year-old former defence minister became premier on October 1. Days later, he called the snap parliamentary elections, promising a "new Japan."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba pledged to revitalise depressed rural regions and to address the "quiet emergency" of Japan's falling population through family-friendly policies such as flexible working hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he has since rowed back his position on issues including allowing married couples to take separate surnames.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also named only two women ministers in his cabinet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rising prices have rankled voters, and also dogging Ishiba is the fallout from a party slush fund scandal that helped sink his predecessor, Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll on Friday by the Yomiuri Shimbun daily suggested that the LDP and its coalition partner Komeito might struggle to get the 233 lower house seats needed for a majority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba has set this threshold as his objective, and missing it would undermine his position in the LDP and mean finding other coalition partners or leading a minority government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Local media speculated that Ishiba could potentially even resign immediately to take responsibility, becoming Japan's shortest-serving prime minister in the post-war period. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel announced the launch of "precise strikes" on military targets in Iran on Saturday, in retaliation for attacks against it, as Iranian state media reported several explosions around the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel - right now the Israel Defense Forces (Israeli military) is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran," the military said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel had vowed, following Iran's October 1 missile attack, to hit back.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hostilities between Iran and Israel soared since Israel launched it's offensive in Gaza last October, which has so far killed over 42,000 Palestinians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel has since broadened the scope of its operations to Lebanon, vowing to secure its northern border after nearly a year of cross-border attacks by Lebanese group Hezbollah.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilised," the Israeli military said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Military spokesman Daniel Hagari in a separate statement called on the people to be "alert and vigilant".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian state television said on Saturday "strong explosions" were heard around the capital, though it did not specify the cause of the blasts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Minutes ago, the sound of strong explosions were heard from around Tehran, the source of these sounds is not yet clear," a state TV presenter said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian media said no fire or explosions had been reported at a main oil refinery near Tehran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States said strikes by its ally Israel on military targets in Iran are "an exercise of self-defence" following the attack earlier this month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a possible indication of the scope of Saturday's strike, Syrian state news agency SANA said Syrian air defences had intercepted what it described as "hostile targets" near the capital city, Damascus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our anti-aircraft defence is confronting hostile targets in the skies around Damascus," SANA said on Telegram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also reported "sounds of explosions" in the vicinity of Damascus, though the origin of those blasts was unclear. (AFP)

  <img alt='Kevin Jordan, (centre), called the decision "extremely disappointing."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A man whose home had to be demolished because of coastal erosion lost a landmark legal claim on Friday against the UK government that accused it of failing to meet obligations to protect citizens from the effects of climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kevin Jordan, whose seaside home on the Norfolk coast in eastern England had to be knocked down, was one of two private claimants who brought the case, along with environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Co-claimant Doug Paulley, a disability activist, lives in a care home in northern England and says hotter summers affect his health and puts him at increased risk of serious harm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They both claimed the government's climate adaptation aims policy, drawn up by the previous Conservative government, failed to comply with the country's 2008 Climate Change Act.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The claim also said the policy failed to assess impacts on protected groups under equality law and that it breached the human rights of the two individual claimants due to the lack of provision for the specific risks they faced.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a judge at the High Court in London ruled on Friday that the government's plans were lawful – a decision described by Jordan as "extremely disappointing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Friends of the Earth said its legal team will "study the detail of this judgement before we decide whether to lodge an appeal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A robust and comprehensive adaptation plan is urgently needed to help protect us from increasingly severe storms, floods and heatwaves – particularly marginalised groups, such as older and disabled people, and those living in areas most at risk from climate change," it added, urging the new Labour government to act. (AFP)

    Putin: It's our affair if Russia uses N Korean troops

  <img alt="Vladimir Putin has not denied US claims that North Korea had sent troops to Russia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776213_2_20241025205551.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that it was Russia's business whether or not it decided to use North Korean troops, and that if Ukraine wanted to join Nato then Moscow could do what it wanted to ensure its own security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States said on Wednesday that it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine, a move that the West is casting as a significant escalation of the Ukraine war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ukraine's military intelligence service said that the first North Korean units trained in Russia had been deployed in the Kursk region, a Russian border area where Ukrainian forces took a chunk of Russian land in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we have to decide something, we will decide... but it is our sovereign decision whether we will apply it, whether we will not, whether we need it," Putin told Russian state television. "This is our business."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin said that the West repeatedly said that it was up to Ukraine how it ensured its security – "with or without Nato".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The sooner they realise the futility of such an approach in relations with Russia, the better it will be for everyone, and perhaps, above all, for themselves," Putin said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday said Russia could send North Korean troops into battle as early as Sunday and urged international pressure on the Kremlin and Pyongyang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "According to intelligence reports, on October 27-28, Russia will use the first North Korean military in combat zones," the Ukrainian leader said on social media, calling for "tangible pressure" to be placed on Russia and North Korea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement during Putin's visit to Pyongyang in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Article 4 of the agreement says: "If one of the parties is subjected to an armed attack by any state or several states and thus finds itself in a state of war, the other party will immediately provide military and other assistance with all means at its disposal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin on Thursday did not deny US claims that North Korea had sent troops to Russia but said it is up to Moscow how to run its mutual defence clause with Pyongyang and accused the West of escalating the Ukraine war. (Reuters/AFP)

    Trami leaves towns submerged, 66 dead in Philippines

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Philippine rescue workers battled floodwaters on Friday to reach residents still trapped on the roofs of their homes as Tropical Storm Trami moved out to sea after killing at least 66 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tens of thousands remained displaced after fleeing floods driven by a torrential downpour that dumped two months' worth of rainfall in just two days in some areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Many are still trapped on the roofs of their homes and asking for help," Andre Dizon, police director for the hard-hit Bicol region, said. "We are hoping that the floods will subside today, since the rain has stopped."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Accessibility remained a major issue for rescuers on Friday, particularly in Bicol, President Ferdinand Marcos said at a press briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There were landslides in areas that didn't have landslides before... so I guess the soil is completely saturated, the water has nowhere to go," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The cities of Naga and Legazpi were reporting "many casualties but we haven't been able to get in yet," Marcos added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As Trami departed the Philippines in the early hours, the storm's death toll swelled as fresh reports of victims emerged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Batangas province south of the capital Manila, police staff sergeant Nelson Cabuso said six unidentified bodies had been found in Sampaloc village.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The area was hit by a flash flood yesterday. Our people are still in the area to check if there are other casualties," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number of confirmed dead in the province stood at at least 34.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Manila was seemingly spared the kind of heavy flooding that accompanied Typhoon Gaemi in July, a subdivision south of the capital was seen to be largely submerged. (AFP)

  <img alt="The continuing fallout from a slush fund scandal that angered voters is adding to Shigeru Ishiba's woes. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776169_1_20241025145940.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba hit out at "biased" media reports related to a party scandal, as a fresh survey suggested that his ruling coalition could fall short of a majority in elections on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This would be the worst result for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) – which has governed Japan for almost all of the past seven decades – since it last lost power from 2009 to 2012, as well as a major blow to Ishiba himself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Adding to Ishiba's woes is the continuing fallout from a slush fund scandal within the LDP that angered voters and helped torpedo his predecessor, Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba promised to not actively support LDP politicians caught up in the scandal running in the election, although they are still standing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But according to media reports, the party has still provided US$132,000 each to district offices headed by these figures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is truly frustrating that such reports come out at a time like this," Ishiba said in a campaign speech on Thursday. "Those candidates will not use the money."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We cannot be defeated by those with biased views," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Opposition leaders pounced on Ishiba's comments, including Yoshihiko Noda, a popular former prime minister who heads the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), the second-biggest in parliament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "However you look at it, it is cash to secretly endorse them. Mr Ishiba is making excuses that no one understands," Noda, 67, said in a campaign speech.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He is angry with these reports? What are you saying? It is the Japanese people who are angry." (AFP)

    Abandon 'mad pursuit' of money, says Pope

  <img alt="Pope Francis delivered the message in a new encyclical letter, the highest form of papal teaching. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776073_1_20241024211531.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pope Francis urged the world's 1.4 billion Catholics to abandon the "mad pursuit" of money and instead devote themselves to their faith in a new encyclical letter, the highest form of papal teaching, released on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Francis' fourth encyclical over his 11-year papacy largely abstains from talking about political issues, a departure from his earlier writings, which also addressed themes such as global climate change and "trickle-down" economic policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Dilexit nos" (He loved us) instead encourages believers to strengthen their religious lives. The world is living in an "age of superficiality," the pope says, and Catholics and other Christians "need to rediscover the importance of the heart".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In a world where everything is bought and sold, people's sense of their worth appears increasingly to depend on what they can accumulate with the power of money," Francis writes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The love of Christ has no place in this perverse mechanism, yet only that love can set us free from a mad pursuit that no longer has room for a gratuitous love," says the pontiff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 142-page text focuses on spiritual themes, rather than calls for concrete political action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pope's 2015 letter "Laudato Si'" (Praise Be) urged the world to care for the environment and has been credited by some world leaders with influencing discussions ahead of the 2016 Paris Agreement. His 2020 letter "Fratelli Tutti" (Brothers All) called for a reconsideration of economic policies in the aftermath of the global coronavirus pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new letter instead offers reflections on a Catholic spiritual practice promoted by a 17th century French nun. Sr. Margaret Mary Alacoque, who reportedly experienced several visions of Jesus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Christians should emulate Jesus' love by also caring for those in need, the pope says. "There is no greater way for us to return love for love," he states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Release of the papal document comes as Francis is leading a month-long summit of global Catholic leaders at the Vatican, which is expected to release its own text on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Discussions around most of the divisive issues originally part of the summit's considerations, such as the possibility of letting women be ordained as Catholic clergy, have now been put on hold. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   At least 1.1 million people on India's eastern coast hunkered down in storm shelters ahead of a powerful cyclone set to hammer the low-lying region early Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cyclone Dana is likely to hit the coasts of West Bengal and Odisha states -- home to around 150 million people -- as a "severe cyclonic storm", India's weather bureau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It predicts winds gusting up to 120 kilometres per hour to cause "major damage" to thatch-roofed houses, which are common on the coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Downpours began lashing areas of neighbouring West Bengal state, prompting officials there to be on high alert, while Odisha already saw strong winds and rain on Thursday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have closed schools, cancelled more than 200 trains, suspended flights and warned fishermen not to venture out to sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India's navy said two ships were "standing by with supplies and rescue and diving teams".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The eye of the storm is predicted to make landfall early Friday, near the coal-exporting port of Dhamra.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Government disaster response teams drove the streets, broadcasting warnings from loudspeakers urging people to take shelter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Crashing waves are expected to inundate swathes of coastal areas, with water predicted to surge up to two metres above usual tide levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India’s eastern coasts have long been prone to cyclones, but the number of intense storms is increasing along the country’s coast, with global warming driven by planet-heating gases causing them to become more extreme and unpredictable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year was India’s deadliest cyclone season in recent years, killing 523 people and costing an estimated US$2.5 billion in damage. (AP/AFP)

    Jailed British nurse Lucy Letby loses appeal

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former British nurse and convicted child serial killer Lucy Letby on Thursday lost an attempt to appeal against her conviction for trying to murder a newborn baby, amid questions over the fairness of her trials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby, 34, was found guilty of murdering seven children and attempting to murder seven more between June 2015 and June 2016 while working in the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital in Chester, northern England, making her Britain's worst serial child killer of modern times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was convicted of an eighth count of attempted murder at a retrial earlier this year, after the original jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge that Letby tried to kill a baby girl by removing her breathing tube.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prosecutor Nick Johnson told Manchester Crown Court that, little more than an hour after the child was born, a senior doctor found the baby's breathing tube dislodged and Letby standing there "doing nothing".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby's lawyer Benjamin Myers told London's Court of Appeal on Thursday that Letby "maintains and has maintained she is not guilty of the offences".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He argued that the retrial was an abuse of process as Letby could not have a fair trial because of extensive coverage of her convictions, which featured "intense hostility towards her" and comments made by the Crown Prosecution Service and police.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There was no way in which the jury in trial two were going to have the publicity and the comment and the hostility ameliorated," Myers said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge William Davis refused Letby's application for leave to appeal against the conviction from her retrial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby attended the hearing by videolink from prison and sat impassively as the judge stated the court's reasons for refusing her application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The outcome of the first trial undoubtedly led to an unusually large amount of publicity and online debate," Davis said. "That is because, on its face, the case was extraordinary."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby's attempt to overturn her convictions from the first trial was refused in May. She can now only challenge those convictions if the Criminal Cases Review Commission refer those cases back to the Court of Appeal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since her trials, Letby's conviction has come under a spotlight, following criticism by some experts of medical and statistical evidence presented by the prosecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some media have questioned whether she might be the victim of a miscarriage of justice, while a public inquiry into her crimes continues.  (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping on Thursday told the Brics summit in the Russian city of Kazan that world peace and development are still facing formidable challenges and urged the group to be a "stabiliser" to ensure global security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Addressing other leaders of Brics nations on the final day of the summit, Xi noted that China is doing what it can to prevent the conflict in the Middle East from spreading.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will continue to advance the ceasefire efforts in Gaza and to start new initiatives to make sure that the war will not extend to Lebanon," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also said that the "common march of the Global South towards modernity is a major event in world history".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to show collective wisdom and strength to make our contribution and show the responsibilities to build a community of shared future for mankind. We have to uphold peace and achieve common security," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be the stabiliser to ensure security and also to continue our efforts to solve problems to ensure global security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brics grew out of meetings between China, Russia, and India, who then began to meet more formally, eventually adding Brazil, then South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. (Additional reporting by AFP, Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tropical Storm Trami has killed at least 26 people and forced more than 150,000 to flee their homes in the Philippines, officials said on Thursday, as it made landfall on the northeastern coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, locally known as severe tropical storm Kristine, dumped heavy to torrential rain on the main island of Luzon, triggering widespread flooding and landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With maximum sustained winds of 95 kph (59 mph), the storm was moving westward across the mountainous northern region of Cordillera towards the South China Sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters warned of heavy to intense rainfall, flooding, landslides and storm surges for some northern provinces.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the deaths from the storm over the past few days were due to drowning and landslides in the central Bicol region, including Naga city where 14 were reported dead on Thursday, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami made landfall in the northeastern town of Divilacan in Isabela province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government ordered businesses and schools in the path of the storm to close in anticipation of heavy rain and floods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 163,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centres, the civil defence office said, most of whom were in Bicol as residents fled their homes after floodwaters reached as high as the roofs of bungalow houses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, a powerful cyclone is expected to barrel into India's eastern coast early on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dana is expected to cross the coasts of the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal between midnight Thursday and Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The states expect to evacuate around 300,000 people each, and Odisha has already moved 50,000 people to relief shelters. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korea "won't sit idle" over the North's deployment of thousands of troops to help Russia fight Ukraine, President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Thursday, slamming it as a "provocation".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency has claimed that about 3,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia training, likely to deploy to the frontlines against Ukraine soon, with thousands more troops to be sent by December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato and Washington have confirmed that Pyongyang's soldiers are now training in Russia, warning that if they were to join the fight against Kyiv, it could mark a dangerous escalation of the grinding war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "South Korea won't sit idle over this," Yoon said after talks with visiting Polish President Andrzej Duda, adding that the two countries agreed North Korea's deployment was "a provocation that threatens global security beyond the Korean Peninsula and Europe".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Poland's Duda spoke to Yoon on Thursday, after which the two leaders "strongly condemned North Korea's nuclear and missile development and provocations“.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korea has previously denied deploying forces to Russia, while Moscow has not confirmed it, but has defended its military cooperation with Pyongyang. (AFP)

    Boeing workers reject contract, extend strike: union

  <img alt="The strike has halted activity at two Seattle-area factories that assemble the Boeing 737 MAX and 777. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776000_1_20241024133808.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Boeing workers in the Seattle region decisively rejected the US aerospace giant's latest contract offer on Wednesday, extending their nearly six-week strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Almost two-thirds – 64 percent – of the members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 rejected the contract, the union said on social media platform X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest Boeing offer had included a 35 percent wage hike, but did not reinstate a pension plan sought by many employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 33,000 hourly workers with the IAM have been on the picket line since September 13, when workers overwhelmingly rejected a Boeing proposal for a new four-year contract to replace the expiring pact.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike has halted activity at two Seattle-area factories that assemble the 737 MAX and 777.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Workers had sought a 40 percent wage increase to make up for years of tepid salary growth that have not kept pace with inflation and that employees complain leave them unable to afford living in one of the most costly regions of the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After 10 years of sacrifices, we still have ground to make up, and we're hopeful to do so by resuming negotiations promptly," Jon Holden, president of the Seattle union, said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is workplace democracy – and also clear evidence that there are consequences when a company mistreats its workers year after year," Holden said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ten years of holding workers back unfortunately cannot be undone quickly or easily, but we will continue to negotiate in good faith until we have made gains that workers feel adequately make up for what the company took from them in the past," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A Boeing spokeswoman said Wednesday night the company had no comment on the vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extension of the strike adds to the troubles facing Boeing and its new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who earlier Wednesday expressed measured optimism the latest contract would be ratified. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping has urged China and India to strengthen communication and cooperation during talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Kazan, Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first bilateral meeting in five years between the two leaders on Wednesday came days after the countries reached a deal on their contested border.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi said the two sides should resolve conflicts and differences and realise each other's development dreams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   State media also quoted the president as saying China and India should "shoulder international responsibilities, set an example for developing countries to seek strength through unity, and contribute to a multi-polar world and democratisation of international relations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Modi, for his part, said mutual trust will guide ties with China, welcoming the consensus over the border issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "India-China relations are important for the people of our countries, and for regional and global peace and stability," Modi said on X. "Mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity will guide bilateral relations."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi and Modi last held formal bilateral talks in October 2019 in the southern Indian town of Mamallapuram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The president also met other leaders on the sidelines of the Brics summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his meeting with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, Xi said an early ceasefire and ending the war in Gaza are key to easing regional tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And in talks with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Xi said Beijing stands ready to work with Cairo to push for an early end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and ease tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also welcomed Egypt's participation in the Brics summit for the first time as a full member.
   <br/>

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Turkey said it launched strikes on Kurdish militants in Iraq and Syria on Wednesday after blaming them for an attack that killed five people at a defence firm near Ankara.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A further 22 people were wounded in the attack, which the government said was "very likely" carried out by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hours later, "an air operation was carried out against terrorist targets in the north of Iraq and Syria," the defence ministry said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A total of 32 targets belonging to the terrorists were successfully destroyed," it said, adding that operations were continuing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Listed as a terror group by Turkey and its Western allies, the PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. It has a number of bases in Kurdish regions of Iraq and Syria.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the attack that sparked the strikes, a huge explosion rocked the headquarters of state-run Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) some 40 kilometres north of Ankara shortly after 3:30 pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It sent clouds of smoke into the air as the sound of gunfire rang out, Turkish media reported, with the incident quickly denounced by Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya as a "terror attack."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was in Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin, called it a "heinous" attack on Turkey's defence industry "targeting the survival of our country," in a message on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yerlikaya said three of the injured were in critical condition and that the two attackers, "a woman and a man," had been "neutralised."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no immediate claim for the attack but Yerlikaya said: "The way in which this action was carried out is very probably linked to the PKK."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said efforts to identify the perpetrators of the attack were ongoing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Defence Minister Yasar Guler also pointed the finger at "PKK villains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As they always do, they tried to disturb our nation's peace through a despicable and dishonourable attack... we will make them suffer for what they have done," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkey's vice president Cevdet Yilmaz said four of the victims were TAI employees while the fifth was a taxi driver. Media reports earlier said the assailants had killed him and taken his taxi to carry out the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An unconfirmed report by private channel NTV said a "group of terrorists" had burst into the building, one of whom "blew himself up" while other outlets reported exchanges of fire for more than an hour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haberturk TV said there was a "hostage situation," with another media pundit saying "a number of hostages" had been rescued.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkish authorities imposed a blackout of live images from the scene.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabah newspaper published what it said was a CCTV image from the entrance showing a black-clad young man with a moustache carrying a rucksack and what appeared to be an assault rifle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As night fell, dozens of ambulances could be seen waiting in convoy near the site, their blue lights flashing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of Turkey's top defence firms and a major arms producer, TAI employs 15,500 people and has a vast production site covering an area of five million square metres, its website says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack drew condemnation from across Turkey and beyond, with Putin offering Erdogan his "condolences in connection with the terror attack" at the start of their meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Statements of condemnation and condolences to the families of the victims also poured in from Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Tehran and Washington and Nato leadership.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack came as Turkey's political establishment appeared to be leaning towards a political, negotiated solution to the decades-long conflict with the Kurdish militants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The timing was not lost on the main pro-Kurdish party, Dem, the third largest force in parliament, which said it was "noteworthy that the attack took place just as Turkish society was talking about a solution and the possibility of dialogue."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It took place a day after the head of the far-right MHP, which belongs to Erdogan's ruling coalition, invited jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to address parliament to announce his movement's dissolution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984, claiming tens of thousands of lives, with Ocalan held in solitary confinement on a prison island since 1999. (AFP)

    Pelicot trial calls for rape law changes in France

  <div class="itemFullText">
   France may introduce changes to its rape law to include consent for the first time, after a mass rape trial shook the country, challenging the limits of existing legislation and prompting some leading politicians to call for change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dominique Pelicot has admitted to drugging his wife and recruiting dozens of men online to rape her while she was unconscious and 50 men are facing trial alongside him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They are accused of taking turns on the drugged and inert body of Gisèle Pelicot while her husband recorded the horror for his swelling private video library.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite video evidence against them, at least 35 of the defendants have denied the rape charges, claiming that Dominique Pelicot tricked them into believing they were taking part in a sex game, or that Gisele Pelicot was feigning sleep.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dominique Pelicot denied this, telling the court his co-defendants knew exactly what the situation was.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case has prompted deep soul-searching in France, with consent at the heart of the matter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am determined that things change in this society," Gisele Pelicot told the Avignon court on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gisele Pelicot insisted from the start that the trial should be open to the public, and has encouraged other women who have been sexually assaulted to come forward.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wanted all women who are rape victims to say to themselves 'Mrs Pelicot did it, so we can do it too'," she said. "It's not us who should feel shame, but them (the perpetrators).”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   France’s new Justice Minister Didier Migaud recently said he is in favour of updating the law, as has President Emmanuel Macron, after France blocked the inclusion of a consent-based rape definition in a European directive in 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I believe it is beyond understanding for our fellow citizens to refuse to include consent in the definition of rape," Migaud told lawmakers earlier this month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 2023 survey by one of France's main polling institutes, IFOP, found that nine out of 10 people polled wanted France to support the EU directive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Consent-based rape law already exists in Sweden, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and more than a dozen other European countries, with the rise of the feminist #MeToo movement prompting legislative reform in some jurisdictions since 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, French criminal law defines rape as a penetrative act or oral sex act committed on someone using "violence, coercion, threat or surprise." It makes no clear mention of the need for a partner's consent and prosecutors must prove the intention to rape to secure a guilty verdict, five legal experts said. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping on Wednesday called on member countries to build Brics for peace and act as guardians of common security in an address at their summit in Kazan, Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also spoke about three principles to help defuse the Ukraine crisis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his speech, the president urged Brics countries to advocate peaceful co-existence and harmony between civilizations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said Brics members should support sustainable development, and that China is willing to leverage its advantages to expand cooperation with the bloc in green industries, clean energy and green minerals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Ukraine, Xi urged Brics nations to uphold the three principles of no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party, with an aim towards de-escalating the crisis as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin has welcomed offers by Brics leaders to mediate in the conflict, his spokesman said Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many countries "expressed a desire to contribute more actively" to resolving the conflict, state media cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters on the sidelines of the summit. (Xinhua & agencies)

    Tokyo Metro shares rocket higher on debut

  <img alt="Proceeds from the Tokyo Metro IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775777_1_20241023103553.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tokyo Metro shares soared more than 40 percent on their debut on Wednesday after its government owners raised US$2.3 billion in Japan's biggest initial public offering since 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In early trade Tokyo Metro shares were at 1,745 yen (US$11.5), up 45 percent from their issue price of 1,200 yen, with reports saying the issue was 15 times oversubscribed among investors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Proceeds from the IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan that killed 18,000 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The listing reduces government ownership, split between the country and Tokyo city, to around 50 percent. Many Japanese rail operators are already privatised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To attract investors, perks for buying more than 200 shares included tickets to the Tokyo Metro museum and golf range, as well as free tempura toppings at its noodle stands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The IPO is Japan's largest since tycoon Masayoshi Son's tech and telecoms conglomerate SoftBank Group raised a national record of US$23.5 billion by listing its mobile unit in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   London built the first public underground railway, but in 1927 Tokyo became the first Asian city with a subway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each day around 6.5 million people ride the Metro's nine lines, which are part of a vast transport network serving the capital and its sprawling suburbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four other subway lines are run separately by the Tokyo government, alongside private services and East Japan Railway's overground routes such as the Yamanote Line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The network's cleanliness and efficiency contrasts with the often creaking infrastructure of other big cities like London, Paris and New York, where many operators are deep in debt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tokyo Metro posted a net profit of 46.3 billion yen for the fiscal year that ended in March 2024, up 67 percent from a year earlier. This year it is aiming to increase this to 52.3 billion yen. (AFP)
