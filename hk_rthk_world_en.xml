<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from the massive earthquake in Myanmar has passed 1,000, the ruling junta there said on Saturday, with more than 2,000 injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the junta's information team said 1,002 people are known to have died in Friday's shallow 7.7-magnitude quake, with 2,376 injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has extended condolences to Myanmar's leader, and a rescue team from Yunnan Province – that borders Myanmar – arrived on Saturday morning at Yangon in Myanmar to provide assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said the only highway linking Myanmar's Yangon in the south and central Naypyidaw and Mandalay was severely damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar in the early afternoon on Friday, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake destroyed buildings, downed bridges, and buckled roads across swathes of Myanmar, with severe damage reported in the second-biggest city, Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 10 more deaths have so far been confirmed in Bangkok, where rescuers laboured through the night searching for workers trapped when a 30-storey skyscraper under construction collapsed, reduced in seconds to a pile of rubble and twisted metal by the force of the shaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the biggest quake to hit Myanmar in over a century, according to US geologists, and the tremors were powerful enough to severely damage buildings across Bangkok, hundreds of kilometres away from the epicentre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to 100 workers were still unaccounted for at the building, close to the Chatuchak weekend market that is a magnet for tourists. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An original animatronic model of the iconic alien created for Steven Spielberg's classic 1982 film "ET the Extra-Terrestrial" is for sale at Sotheby's and is estimated to fetch as much as US$900,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Created by Oscar-winning special effects artist Carlo Rambaldi, the model is one of three used in the film and is specifically the one featured in the closet scene when ET is hiding among loads of stuffed animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The model - which stands 91.4 centimetres tall, according to Sotheby's listing - is from the personal collection of Rambaldi, an animatronics pioneer who died in 2012.
  <br>
  <br>
  The starting bid is US$500,000 in the online sale, which closes on April 3. The estimated price is from US$600,000 to US$900,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This model embodies the artistry of an era before CGI took hold, a nostalgic and iconic piece of Hollywood history as captivating as the stories themselves," said Cassandra Hatton, a Sotheby's vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ET model was able to perform 150 different movements, such as frowning or stretching his neck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rambaldi collaborated on other blockbuster sci-fi films including Spielberg's "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (1977), Ridley Scott's "Alien" (1979) and John Guillermin's "King Kong" (1976).
  <br>
  <br>
  The auction includes other objects from the Italian artist's collection, including two of the model sandworms used in David Lynch's "Dune." (AFP)

    Trump, Carney hail 'extremely productive' call

<img alt="During the call, Carney told Trump his government would impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods from April 2. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797975_1_20250329071156.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said he had an "extremely productive" first call Friday with Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney, after soaring tensions over tariffs and Trump's wish to annex his northern neighbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump added that the two planned to meet soon after Canada's April 28 general election in which Carney - who took office two weeks ago - has made standing up to the US president the focus of his campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just finished speaking with Prime Minister Mark Carney, of Canada. It was an extremely productive call, we agree on many things," Trump said on his Truth Social network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Typically, a new Canadian leader makes a phone call with the US president an immediate priority, but this was Trump and Carney's first contact since the Canadian was sworn in on March 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's office said the pair had a "very constructive conversation" and agreed to begin "comprehensive negotiations about a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added, however, that Carney told Trump his government would impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods from April 2, when sweeping US levies are set to come into place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're not going to back down, we're going to respond with force," Carney said at an afternoon press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What is clear is that the relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. And we're not the one's who changed," he added, confirming that Canada needed to look to Europe "to strengthen ties with reliable partners."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the coming weeks, months and years, we must fundamentally reimagine our economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's glowing post was still a dramatic change in tone from recent rhetoric between Washington and Ottawa, who are Nato allies and long-standing economic partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has sparked fury in Canada by repeatedly insisting it should become the 51st US state and by slapping or threatening tariffs on the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  His post on Friday was notable for its diplomacy, as Trump gave Carney his official title of prime minister and made no reference to his annexation drive. (AFP)

    Vance accuses Denmark of underinvesting in Greenland

<img alt="US Vice President JD Vance demanded Denmark change its approach as President Trump pushes to take over the Danish territory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797969_1_20250329062730.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance accused Denmark on Friday of not having done enough to protect Greenland when he visited the resource-rich Danish territory coveted by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vance made his comment during a trip to the Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, a visit viewed by Copenhagen and Nuuk as a provocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our message to Denmark is basic: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland," Vance told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump argues that the United States needs the vast Arctic island for national and international security and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not talking about peace for the United States. We are talking about world peace. We are talking about international security," Trump claimed to reporters at the White House on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the potential use of force, Vance stressed that the US administration did not think it was "ever going to be necessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen hit back at Vance in a statement to Danish media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For many years, we have stood by the Americans in very difficult situations," she said, referring to Danish combat deployments alongside American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Vice President's reference to Denmark is not accurate," she said, expressing her readiness to "cooperate day and night with the Americans" on Arctic security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance was accompanied by his wife, Usha; National Security Advisor Mike Waltz; Energy Secretary Chris Wright; Utah Senator Mike Lee; and former Homeland Security Advisor Julia Nesheiwat, who is Waltz's wife.
  <br>
  <br>
  A majority of Greenlanders oppose US annexation, according to a January poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's desire to take over the ice-covered territory, which is seeking independence from Denmark, has been categorically rejected by Greenlanders, their politicians and Danish officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  While all of Greenland's political parties favour independence, none of them support the idea of becoming part of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new broad four-party coalition government was announced in Greenland just hours before the US delegation's arrival, following elections earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Incoming prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said the territory needed unity at this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is critical that we put aside our disagreements and differences... because only in this way will we be able to cope with the heavy pressure we are exposed to from outside," he said when he unveiled his government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nielsen said that by visiting Greenland when there was no government in office there, the US administration was "not showing respect to an ally". (AFP)

 The earthquake in Myanmar was felt in China's Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and caused injuries and damage to houses in the city of Ruili on the border with northern Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Videos that one outlet said it had received from a person in Ruili showed building debris littering a street and a person being wheeled on a stretcher toward an ambulance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shaking in Mangshi, a Chinese city about 100 kilometres northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people couldn’t stand, one resident told The Paper, an online media outlet. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A major hospital in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw is a "mass casualty area" after the country was rocked by a huge earthquake, an official at the facility said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rows of wounded were treated outside the emergency department of the 1,000-bed general hospital, some writhing in pain, others lying still as relatives sought to comfort them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The entrance of the emergency department at the city's main hospital pancaked onto a car.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hospital official said that "this is a mass casualty area."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another official said hundreds of injured people had arrived at the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't seen [anything] like this before," a doctor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are trying to handle the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so exhausted now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The route to the hospital was jammed with vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ambulance tried to make its way through, a paramedic shouting "cars, move aside so the ambulance can get through."
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake damaged religious shrines, sending parts and some homes toppling to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the National Museum in Yangon, pieces fell from the ceiling as the building began shaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uniformed staff ran outside, some trembling and tearful, others grabbing cellphones to try to contact loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of the former royal palace and buildings were damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the area is prone to earthquakes, it is generally sparsely populated, and most houses are low-rise structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Sagaing region just southwest of Mandalay, the 90-year-old Ava Bridge collapsed, and some sections of the highway connecting Mandalay and Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, were also damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents in Yangon rushed out of their homes when the quake struck. There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths. (Agencies)

 A strong 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit central Myanmar on Friday, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said, buckling roads in the capital Naypyidaw and with tremors felt in China and Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok police say a 30-storey building under construction for government offices collapsed when the earthquake hit around midday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medics say at least 43 workers are trapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic video circulating on social media showed the multi-storey building with a crane on top collapsing into a cloud of dust, while onlookers screamed and ran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were responding to the collapse, which happened near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak Market, but had no immediate information on how many workers were on the site at the time of the collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tremor's epicentre was located 16 kilometres northwest of the city of Sagaing at a depth of 10 kilometres around 12:50 pm, the USGS said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some metro and light rail services were suspended in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's stock exchange said on it is on "full halt."
  <br>
  <br>
  The midday temblor was followed by a strong 6.4 magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roads were buckled by the force of the tremors and chunks of ceilings fell from buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt through northern Thailand and down to the capital Bangkok, where residents ran into the streets as buildings shook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I heard it and I was sleeping in the house, I ran as far as I could in my pyjamas out of the building," said Duangjai, a resident of the popular northern tourist city Chiang Mai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt in Yunnan province, according to Beijing's quake agency, which said the jolt measured 7.9 in magnitude. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's junta chief Min Aung Hlaing will join a regional leaders' summit in Thailand next week where he is seeking high-level bilateral meetings, said three sources with direct knowledge, in a rare visit to a Southeast Asian country since seizing power in coup that led to a civil war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Min Aung Hlaing is the subject of widespread western sanctions and is barred from attending summits of the Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN due to the Myanmar military's failure to implement an agreed peace plan with the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will join the April 3-4 summit in Bangkok of the BIMSTEC grouping of mostly South Asian countries, where the Myanmar delegation is seeking bilateral meetings with leaders and top officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meetings being sought include ones with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of Bangladesh’s interim government, Muhammed Yunus, the sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have been reaching out asking for meetings," one of the sources said, referring to Myanmar officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar has been in crisis since the military overthrew the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking mass protests that escalated into an armed rebellion against the junta.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a third of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta chief said on Thursday said an election would be held in December, promising a free and fair vote and to transfer state power to the winning party. (Reuters)

    Rallies set as Duterte marks 80th birthday in prison

<img alt="Relatives of drug war and extrajudicial killing victims in Quezon City watch a live telecast of the initial appearance of Rodrigo Duterte at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797846_1_20250328130849.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Family and supporters of former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte will rally on Friday to mark his 80th birthday and protest his detention in The Hague on a charge of crimes against humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Duterte could spend the rest of his life in jail if convicted at the International Criminal Court (ICC) of the charge tied to his "war on drugs" in which thousands were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters are planning more than 200 simultaneous birthday rallies demanding his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, his eldest daughter, has been in the Dutch city for more than two weeks helping assemble his legal team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another of the ex-president's daughters, 20-year-old Veronica as well as her mother, Cielito Avancena, said they failed to get inside the prison to see him on Wednesday – but remained hopeful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will make sure I get to see him," Veronica told a Philippine television network outside the ICC detention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another of the ex-president's sons is expected, as well as his ex-wife Elizabeth Zimmerman, according to Sara Duterte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC chief prosecutor's application for his arrest said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population" in the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's arrest on March 11 and rapid handover to the international tribunal came on the heels of his family's bitter falling out with his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cracks began to appear in their alliance soon after Marcos teamed up with Sara Duterte to sweep the presidential and vice presidential elections in May 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president quit her cabinet post as education secretary after being denied the defence portfolio, while Duterte himself began calling Marcos a drug addict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Sara Duterte was impeached by a pro-Marcos House of Representatives on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outcome of her Senate trial will likely depend on the number of seats her allies win in May 12 mid-term elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of her party's candidates, former Philippine police chief and drug war enforcer Ronald Dela Rosa, says he expects to be arrested by the ICC next.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ex-president faces a six-month wait inside the United Nations' Scheveningen prison before his next scheduled court appearance on September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is only allowed two visits per day – a lawyer and a family member, said the vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I urged him to write a book and then when you get out, we'll sell it and make money out of it," she said. (AFP)

    Rubio says too early for high-level Russia talks

<img alt="Marco Rubio says US President Donald Trump's administration would hold consultations to discuss the outcome of the meetings with Russia. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797827_1_20250328115755.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned on Thursday it was premature to expect high-level talks with Russia, while the United States weighs Moscow's response to Washington's efforts to end the Ukraine war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Asked by a reporter if it was time for higher-level talks after indirect US negotiations with the two sides in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said: "I think you have to make more progress on a technical level."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of work to be done with both sides, particularly with the Russian side, which we haven't talked to for years," Rubio said on his plane to his home city of Miami from a three-nation Caribbean tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  On how long it would take to make progress, Rubio said, "I just can't put a timeframe on that because it doesn't depend on us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said US President Donald Trump's administration would hold consultations to discuss the outcome of the meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has repeatedly said he hopes to meet soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin, likely in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States announced on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine had agreed to hold fire in strikes on the Black Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Russia later said it had conditions, as it seeks relief from the sweeping sanctions imposed by the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio had earlier called on Russia to accept unconditionally a Ukrainian-backed proposal for a 30-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron has rejected Russian calls for an easing of Western sanctions, saying it was far too early and more progress was needed. (AFP)

    Rubio warns Venezuela against Guyana attacks

<img alt="Guyanese President Mohamed Irfaan Ali, left, with Marco Rubio in Georgetown, Guyana. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797818_1_20250328105815.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Marco Rubio bluntly warned Venezuela against attacking its oil-rich neighbour Guyana, brandishing the power of the US military to protect the small South American nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela, whose leftist leader Nicolas Maduro is despised by the Cuban-American Rubio, has increasingly pushed its claim to the disputed Essequibo region controlled by Guyana, and was accused this month of making an incursion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have full confidence saying it now as secretary of state – there will be consequences for adventurism. There will be consequences for aggressive action," Rubio said in Guyana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what the United States would do if Venezuela attacked ExxonMobil oil projects in Guyana, Rubio said: "It would be a very bad day -- a very bad week for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stopping short of spelling out a military response, Rubio said: "We have a big navy, and it can get almost anywhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Maduro responded angrily to the threat, calling Rubio an "imbecile" and saying "no one threatens Venezuela."
  <br>
  <br>
  While in Guyana, Rubio signed an agreement to boost security cooperation with the country including through greater information sharing. It comes years after Guyana and the United States agreed to joint maritime patrols.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyanese President Irfaan Ali welcomed the stance of Rubio, who called Venezuela's claims "illegitimate."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very pleased at the reassurance of the US, ensuring the safeguard of our territorial integrity and sovereignty," Ali said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement on Telegram, said his country did "not need nor seek conflicts, but neither will we allow foreign interests to try to rewrite the reality about our Essequibo."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get your noses out of this dispute!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyana, an English-speaking former British and Dutch colony where the majority of the 800,000 people still live in poverty, has for years had a long-shot movement that has sought to join the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such formal accession was not on the agenda, but Trump has made no secret of his passion for expansionism in the Western Hemisphere, even at the expense of traditional alliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Exxon has dominated the oil industry, China has made rapid inroads in Guyana with infrastructure projects including an expansion of the international airport where Rubio landed. (AFP)

    Trump pulls UN envoy nomination amid Congress fears

<img alt="Donald Trump with US Representative Elise Stefanik last year. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797812_1_20250328104043.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump withdrew right-wing firebrand Elise Stefanik as his nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations as Republicans fear for their narrow majority in Congress.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New York congresswoman is just the second Trump cabinet pick not to go through, after Matt Gaetz pulled out of the running to be attorney general following allegations of sexual misconduct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik is a vocal Trump ally and pro-Israel stalwart.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat" in the House of Representatives, Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said it was "essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had asked Stefanik to stay in Congress and "rejoin the House leadership team," although he did not say in what capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans won both the House and Senate in the November 2024 election that returned Trump to the White House, but they have a very tight lead in the lower chamber.
  <br>
  <br>
  They control the House by 218 seats to 213, giving them just a tiny margin and making it difficult to pass key legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two crucial special elections will be held in Florida on April 1 to fill the seats vacated by Mike Waltz, who is now Trump's national security advisor, and Gaetz.
  <br>
  <br>
  While both Republicans comfortably won the seats in November, polling in one of the districts has shown the Democratic candidate closing the gap considerably.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump himself has leaned into the races, with an appearance Thursday at a candidate's online event seen as evidence that Republicans are worried.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those concerns were further heightened on Tuesday, when a special election for Pennsylvania's state senate saw Democrats flip a district that Trump won handily last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik has effectively been in limbo since Trump's nomination, keeping her place in the House for a number of key votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A firebrand who was considered a moderate before the Trump era, Stefanik is seen as one of the most vocal supporters in Congress of both Israel and US Jewish causes. (AFP)

    Light rain aids firefighters in South Korea

<div class="itemFullText">
 Light rain offered some relief to South Korean authorities tackling the country's worst wildfires on record, with exhausted firefighters making another push on Friday to contain blazes stretching 70 km.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 28 people have died and more than 45,000 hectares of largely forest land in the country's southeast have been charred or are burning, as strong winds have driven blazes from central Uiseong county to coastal regions over the past week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uiseong reported fires had been put out in 95 percent of the area as of early Friday, and flames in 85 percent of the neighbouring Andong city, which is home to UNESCO World Heritage sites, have been doused, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeongdeok county on the east coast, where the fire spread from the initial blaze more than 70 km away in under 12 hours, was still fighting to contain the flames, with nearly a third of the area still ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rain of less than 3 mm fell in some parts of the regions on Thursday and had offered "a little help," forest service spokesman Kim Jong-gun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters and helicopters were taking advantage of more favourable weather and better visibility to make a push to make more progress before winds are expected to pick up later on Friday, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blazes that began in Uiseong have become the biggest single forest fire in South Korea's history, destroying an area equivalent to about two-thirds of the island of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 80 helicopters started flying at daybreak on Friday to dump water, the safety ministry said. A helicopter pilot died on Wednesday after crashing while trying to tackle a blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wildfires have displaced more than 30,000 residents, many of whom are elderly, and ravaged everything in their path, including historic temples and homes, in the mountainous forest regions of North Gyeongsang province. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arctic sea ice had its weakest winter buildup since record-keeping began 47 years ago, a symptom of climate change that will have repercussions globally, scientists said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Arctic reaches its maximum sea ice in March each year and then starts a six-month melt season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Snow and Ice Data Centre said the peak measurement taken on Saturday was 14.33 million square kilometres - about 80,000 square kilometres smaller than the lowest previous peak in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Warming temperatures are what’s causing the ice to decline,'' ice data scientist Walt Meier said. “You know, sea ice in particular is very sensitive... 31 degrees is ice skating and 33 degrees it’s swimming.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists said warming conditions in the Arctic - the region is warming four times faster than the rest of the world - affect weather elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The warming winter atmosphere above the Arctic Circle does impact large-scale weather patterns that do influence those of us outside the Arctic,” said Julienne Stroeve, an ice scientist at the University of Manitoba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the smaller sea ice, Stroeve noted that not only was there less of it, the remaining ice was thin enough for more of it to melt quickly this summer. She cautioned that a record low area in the winter didn't guarantee a record small area in the summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Melting Arctic sea ice - mostly in the summer - is making the polar bear population smaller, weaker and hungrier because they rely on the sea ice to hunt from, scientists said. And winter sea ice is especially important for fisheries and seal pups, Meier said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arctic sea ice's biggest year since record-keeping began was 1979, at 16.64 million square kilometres. That means since satellites began tracking it, Arctic sea ice's winter peak has shrunk by about the size of Pakistan. (AP)

    Australian PM calls general election for May 3

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia will hold a general election on May 3, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday, locking in a showdown over climate action, nuclear power and a runaway housing market.
 <br>
  <br>
  Albanese's centre-left Labour party took office in May 2022, turfing out a conservative government deeply unpopular after almost a decade in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  But initial enthusiasm for Albanese, 62, has evaporated in recent months as the government nears the end of its three-year term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls show him neck-and-neck with right-leaning Peter Dutton, 54, a hard-nosed former detective who wants to cut back on immigration and reverse a ban on nuclear power.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the last few years, the world has thrown a lot at Australia in uncertain times," the prime minister told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because of the strength and resilience that our people have shown, Australia is turning the corner. Now, on May 3, you choose the way forward."
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese declared he was "born ready" to deal with climate challenges, tariff turmoil and the long tail of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he warned any foreign foes intent on meddling in the election campaign to "back off".
  <br>
  <br>
  Coal mining-superpower Australia will choose between two candidates with sharply contrasting ideas on climate change and emissions reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese's government has embraced the global push towards decarbonisation, warning of a future in which iron ore and polluting coal exports no longer prop up the economy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday he would call a general election "imminently," with local media reporting the poll would be held on May 3.
 <br>
  <br>
  Albanese's left-leaning Labor government is nearing the end of its three-year term and must hold an election by May 17 at the latest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recent polls show the government is neck-and-neck with its conservative rivals, who were turfed out in 2022 after almost a decade in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  As speculation mounted on Thursday, Albanese said he was preparing to call the election "soon."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be called pretty imminently," he told a local radio station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Multiple media outlets – including national broadcaster ABC – reported Albanese would announce the official start of campaigning on Friday, setting an election date of May 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 62-year-old's government released its annual budget this week, courting votes with surprise tax cuts and a raft of other sweeteners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conservative leader Peter Dutton, 54, has pilloried Albanese, accusing him of "weak" leadership and stoking inflation through government largesse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutton's signature policy is a US$200 billion scheme to construct seven industrial-scale nuclear reactors, putting the brakes on the growth of renewable energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polling shows economic concerns and the high cost of housing will dominate the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although inflation has eased under Albanese – from 7.8 percent in 2022 to 2.4 percent in December – many households are still struggling with high food, fuel, and power prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major cities Sydney and Melbourne now rank among the 10 least-affordable housing markets in the world, according to the annual Demographia affordability index. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China warned on Thursday a trade war would have "no winners" after US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent import tariffs on foreign-made cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariffs won't help Washington solve its own problems, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China also rebuffed a suggestion from Trump that he might offer to reduce tariffs on the country to get Beijing's approval for the sale of popular social media platform TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said its position on the tariff issue is consistent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said China is willing to engage with Washington on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok's parent ByteDance has to find a non-Chinese buyer of the short video app used by 170 million Americans by April 5 or face a US ban on national security grounds. (AFP/Reuters)

 Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said it plans to set incentives for London's Heathrow to invest in its operations and provide high-quality service as part of the regulator's periodic review, days after a closure at the airport rocked airlines.
 <br>
  <br>
  The review and guidance look into several aspects of how Heathrow, a major global travel hub, functions and develops: from investments, to airline charges, to environmental impact, and preparedness to handle a crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said on Thursday that under its latest regulatory review that would look into operations from 2027 to 2031, the CAA would also "carefully consider the rules on resilience after the closure of Heathrow Airport on 21 March 2025."
  <br>
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's auto sector is expected to face "considerable difficulties" when US import tariffs on cars announced by President Donald Trump take effect and the government plans an emergency response by April, the industry minister said.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea will also actively engage the US government to explore measures to minimise the negative impact on South Korea's auto companies and suppliers, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun said in a meeting with industry officials on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Global uncertainties are growing but South Korean auto companies will not be fighting alone," Ahn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will consider financial assistance, investment support, and help with market diversification, he said, adding that parts suppliers are expected to be hit particularly hard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles sparked criticism and threats of retaliation from countries affected by the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in South Korea's Hyundai Motor shed more than 4 percent and sister automaker Kia Corp fell more than 3 percent. Hyundai Motor shares are set to post their biggest daily drop since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai together with affiliate Kia is the world's third-largest automaker by sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, South Korea's exports of automobiles to the United States stood at US$34.7 billion, accounting for 49 percent of its total auto exports. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's cabinet on Thursday approved a draft law for casinos and entertainment complexes, as the government looks to attract more tourists and build a major gaming industry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gambling is mostly banned in Thailand apart from state-controlled horse racing, the lottery and on some sports but successive governments have pressed the case for allowing casinos to draw in more foreign visitors and create more jobs and state revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the latest draft approved by cabinet will significantly limit how many Thai punters can go to casinos, with an entry fee of 5,000 baht and proof of at least 50 million baht in bank deposits, effectively blocking large swathes of the population, where per capita gross domestic product is about US$7,300.
  <br>
  <br>
  A deputy finance minister said this month the assets requirement for Thai nationals would be dropped because it would exclude too many people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another restriction is that the casino area may only occupy up to 10 percent of the entire space of an entertainment complex, according to a government statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draft law will be sent to parliament, and if passed, will also need approval from the Senate and the king.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said details of the law were not final as parliament would have the final say.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Citi report late last year estimated that about half of people aged 20 and more in Thailand could be casino players, providing a base for the country to potentially become the world's third-largest gambling destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government, led by the populist Pheu Thai party, hopes to attract at least 100 billion baht in new investment in casinos and entertainment complexes and see an annual boost to foreign arrivals of 5 to 10 percent, while generating revenue of more than 12 billion baht a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite most betting and gambling being outlawed in Thailand, illicit operations have operated for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  A January opinion poll in Thailand indicated there was opposition to the plan, however, and some political parties have argued that building a gambling industry would worsen social problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several countries in Southeast Asia have legalised casinos, but only a few like Singapore has been successful in drawing global giants such as Las Vegas Sands Corp on the back of robust regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism is a key driver of Thailand, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the government expects 38 million foreign arrivals, closing in on its pre-pandemic record of nearly 40 million tourists. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's government on Thursday warned of a "significant impact" on its economic ties with the United States -- and on global trade -- after US President Donald Trump announced import tariffs on cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo is a close economic and strategic US ally, with its firms the biggest investors in the United States and one in 10 Japanese jobs are connected to the auto sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced on Wednesday 25 percent tariffs "on all cars that are not made in the United States" effective 12.01am eastern time on April 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who last month held friendly talks with Trump at the White House, said Japan was reviewing an "appropriate" response.

  "Japan has made significant investments and significant job creation, which doesn't apply to all countries... we are the number one (country) in investment in the United States," Ishiba added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US president's understanding on this is significantly deepening. However, various things are happening, so we are considering all kinds of countermeasures," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi went further, calling the tariffs "extremely regrettable" and warning of major effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that the current measures and other broad-based trade restrictions by the US government could have a significant impact on the economic relationship between Japan and the US, as well as on the global economy and the multilateral trading system," Hayashi told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response to this announcement, we have again told the US government that this measure was extremely regrettable and we strongly urged the US government to exclude Japan from the scope of this measure," Hayashi said.

  Trump's announcement hammered carmakers in Asia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildfires raging in South Korea doubled in size on Thursday from a day earlier, as authorities called the blazes the country's worst natural fire disaster with at least 26 people killed and historic temples incinerated.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 33,000 hectares has been charred or were still burning in the largest of the fires that began in the central Uiseong county, making it the biggest single forest fire in South Korea's history. The previous record was 24,000 hectares in a March 2000 fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are nationally in a critical situation with numerous casualties because of the unprecedented rapid spread of forest fires," Acting President Han Duck-soo told a government response meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military has released stocks of aviation fuel to help keep firefighting helicopters flying to douse flames across mountainous regions in the southeast of the country where fires have been burning now for nearly a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 120 helicopters have been deployed in three regions battling the blazes, the safety ministry said. South Korea relies on helicopters to fight forest fires because of its mountainous terrain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wildfires that originated in Uiseong have been moving rapidly eastward, spreading almost to the coast, carried by gusty winds and with dry conditions aggravating the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the meteorological agency has forecast some rain for the southwest, precipitation is expected to be under five millimetres for most of the affected areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount of rain is going to be small so it doesn't look like it'll be big help in trying to extinguish the fire," Korea Forest Service Minister Lim Sang-seop told a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have said the Uiseong fire showed extremely unusual spread in terms of its scale and speed, and that climate change is expected to make wildfires more frequent and deadly globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Higher temperatures amplified by human-caused climate change contributed to the existing seasonally dry conditions, "turning dry landscapes into dangerous fire fuel" in the region, the Climate Central group, an independent body made up of scientists and researchers, said in a report. (Reuters)

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet top French diplomat Jean-Noel Barrot on Thursday for talks on topics like the war in Ukraine and trade between China and the European Union.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has said it hopes this week's visit by the French foreign minister would see the countries deepen cooperation in a world facing "turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also said the two sides will discuss ways to "jointly resist unilateralism and the resurgence of the law of the jungle".
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris expects the talks will focus on a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, as well as the Middle East and trade tensions between China and the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his meeting Wang, Barrot will then head to Shanghai, where he will on Friday inaugurate a hydrogen production plant built by the Air Liquide group and participate in a Franco-Chinese business forum. (AFP)

    Canada PM dubs US auto tariffs 'direct attack'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reacted with anger on Wednesday to US President Donald Trump's imposition of import tariffs on cars, branding it a "direct attack" on his country.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will defend our workers. We'll defend our companies. We'll defend our country. And we'll defend it together," said Carney.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will hurt us, but through this period, by being together, we will emerge stronger."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said earlier Wednesday that he was placing 25 percent tariffs on auto imports and, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney said he needs to see the details of Trump's executive order before taking retaliatory measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called it unjustified and said he would leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday to chair his special Cabinet committee on US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion (US$1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that would protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump’s tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Carney noted it employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said. (Agencies)

    Trump hints at lower tariffs for China over TikTok

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to reduce tariffs to get a deal done with TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the short video app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  ByteDance has an April 5 deadline to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok or face a US ban on national security grounds that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he was willing to extend the deadline if an agreement over the social media app was not reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok did not immediately comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has used tariffs as a bargaining chip in the TikTok negotiations in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 20, his first day in office, he warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a US deal with TikTok. Earlier this month, Trump hiked his additional tariffs on all imports from China to 20 percent up from 10 percent issued in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President JD Vance has said he expects the general terms of an agreement that resolves the ownership of the social media platform to be reached by April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law, passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, required ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app briefly went dark in January after the US Supreme Court upheld the ban, but flickered back to life days later once Trump took office. Trump quickly issued an executive order postponing enforcement of the law to April 5 and said last month that he could further extend that deadline to give himself time to shepherd a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been involved to an unprecedented level in the closely watched deal talks, effectively playing the role of investment bank. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denmark welcomed on Wednesday Washington's decision to limit an American delegation's visit to Greenland to a US military base, after previous plans for the unexpected trip sparked criticism.
 <br>
  <br>
  US Vice President JD Vance announced on Tuesday that he would accompany his wife Usha on Friday to the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the Danish self-governing island coveted by President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to power in January, Trump has insisted he wants to take over Greenland for national security purposes, refusing to rule out the use of force to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance's announcement came just hours after Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland's outgoing Prime Minister Mute Egede harshly criticised plans by a US delegation to visit the Arctic island uninvited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egede had qualified the initial plans as "foreign interference", noting the outgoing government had not "sent out any invitations for visits, private or official".
  <br>
  <br>
  Following March 11 elections, Greenland has only a transitional government, with parties still in negotiations to form a new coalition government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have asked all countries to respect this process," Egede had said in a Facebook post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the White House announced on Sunday that Usha Vance would travel to Greenland from Thursday to Saturday, while Egede had said US national security adviser Mike Waltz was also expected to take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  US media had reported that Energy Secretary Chris Wright would be part of the visit as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Usha Vance had been scheduled to view "historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage and watch the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race," in the southwestern town of Sisimiut, the White House had said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frederiksen denounced that visit as "unacceptable pressure" being put on Greenland and Denmark, and vowed "to resist". (AFP)

    Netanyahu threatens to seize parts of Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened on Wednesday to seize parts of Gaza if Hamas does not release hostages, while the militant group warned they would return "in coffins" if Israel does not stop bombing the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Just over a week since the military resumed operations following a January truce, Israel said two projectiles were fired from the Gaza Strip, with one intercepted and the other landing near the border, and with no immediate reports of any casualties or damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rocket fire came a day after hundreds of Palestinians staged a rare protest against Hamas, chanting slogans against the Islamist movement and calling for an end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shattering weeks of relative calm in the war brought by the fragile ceasefire, Israel last week resumed intense bombardment and ground operations across Gaza, while militants returned to launching rocket attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, 830 people have been killed in the territory since Israel resumed its strikes on March 18. No deaths have been reported on the Israeli side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli officials say the resumption of operations was meant to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages, after a stalemate in talks with mediators on extending the truce – which saw 33 Israeli captives freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel wanted an extension of the truce's initial phase, while Hamas demanded talks on a second stage that was meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu told parliament that "the more Hamas persists in its refusal to release our hostages, the stronger the pressure we will exert".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This includes the seizure of territories, along with other measures I will not elaborate here," he added, days after his Defence Minister Israel Katz had warned: "The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel".
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which triggered the war, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. (AFP)

    Trump announces 25pc tariff on non-US-built cars

<img alt="US President Donald Trump announces tariffs on auto imports in the Oval Office. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797599_1_20250327060802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on auto imports Wednesday, in a move set to fuel tensions with trading partners ahead of further promised levies next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States. If they're made in the United States, it is absolutely no tariff," he said at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is set to take effect April 2 -- with duties to be collected from April 3 -- and impact foreign-made cars and light trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies will be in addition to those already in place for the goods, and Trump added that "this is permanent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has imposed fresh tariffs on imports from major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China -- as well as a 25 percent duty on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he previously offered automakers temporary reprieve from the levies affecting North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uncertainty over Trump's trade plans and worries they could trigger a downturn have roiled financial markets, with consumer confidence also falling in recent months amid fears of the tariffs' effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street slumped ahead of Trump's announcement, with the tech-focused Nasdaq plunging 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in automaker General Motors closed 3.1 percent down, while Ford eked out a 0.1 percent gain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has referred to levies as a way to raise government revenue, revitalize American industry and press countries on US priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But targeting imported cars could strain ties with countries like Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico and Germany -- which are close US partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Center for Automotive Research has previously estimated that US tariffs -- including those on metals and imported autos -- could increase the price of a car by thousands of dollars and weigh on the jobs market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the automobile industry, Trump is also eyeing sector-specific tariffs on industries like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intent to impose tariffs on lumber and pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's announcement on autos comes ahead of April 2, which Trump has dubbed "Liberation Day" for the world's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has promised reciprocal levies on the date, tailored to different trading partners in an attempt to remedy practices that Washington deemed unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday he said these duties will impact all countries but that they would be "very lenient."
  <br>
  <br>
  It is unclear if further sector-specific tariffs would be announced on April 2, with the White House noting this week that the situation remained fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters Monday that he might "give a lot of countries breaks" eventually, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added Tuesday that he did not want too many exceptions.

  <br>
  Hopes of a narrower tariff rollout had given financial markets a boost, but investors remain jittery over rapid policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump has invoked emergency economic powers for some recent tariffs, his auto levies may build on a previous government investigation completed in 2019, former US trade official Ryan Majerus told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe found that excessive imports were weakening the internal economy and might impair national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time, one recommendation was to institute tariffs of up to 25 percent to bolster US production of autos and parts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advantage with autos," said Majerus, now a partner at the King & Spalding law firm, is that the administration "can act a lot quicker if they want, as opposed to, say in lumber or copper, where they had to launch investigations."
  <br>
  <br>
  US trade partners have been furthering talks with Washington as Trump's reciprocal tariff deadline looms.
  <br>

  EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic met his American counterparts Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sefcovic said on social media that "the EU's priority is a fair, balanced deal instead of unjustified tariffs." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Atlantic magazine on Wednesday published what it said was the entire text of a chat group mistakenly shared with a journalist by top US national security officials, laying out plans for an imminent attack on Yemen.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stunning details, including the times of strikes and types of planes being used, were all laid out in screenshots of the chat, which the officials had conducted on a commercial Signal messaging app, rather than a secure government platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  The magazine, which initially only published the broad outlines of the chat, said it was now publishing the details after the Trump administration repeatedly denied that any classified information had been included.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scandal has rocked President Donald Trump's administration, which for now is reacting defiantly – attacking The Atlantic and denying any wrongdoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt quickly responded to say The Atlantic was conceding "these were NOT 'war plans.' The entire story was another hoax."
  <br>
  <br>
  National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes had said on Monday the chain cited by The Atlantic appeared to be "authentic."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg said Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sent information in the Signal chat – also including Vice President JD Vance and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe – right ahead of strikes against the Houthi rebels on March 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  For reasons unknown, Goldberg's phone number had been added to the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldberg also revealed disparaging comments by the top US officials about European allies during their chat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic initially did not publish the precise details of the chat, saying it wanted to avoid revealing classified material and information that could endanger American troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Tuesday, Ratcliff and other officials involved in the chat played down the scandal, testifying before Congress that nothing critical had been shared or laws broken – and that nothing discussed was classified.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic said on Wednesday that it had asked the government whether in that case there would be any problem in publishing the rest of the material.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt responded, The Atlantic said, telling the magazine again that "there was no classified information transmitted in the group chat."
  <br>
  <br>
  And a CIA spokesperson asked only that one of the agency's officials referenced in the chain not be identified by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic said its publication on Wednesday included everything in the Signal chain other than that one CIA name.
  <br>
  <br>
  It includes Hegseth laying out the weather conditions, times of attacks and types of aircraft being used.
  <br>
  <br>
  The texting was done barely half an hour before the first US warplanes took off and two hours before the first target, described as "Target Terrorist," was expected to be bombed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The details are shockingly precise for the kind of operation that the public usually only learns about later – and in vaguer terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)," Hegseth writes at one stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier 'Trigger Based' targets)."
  <br>
  <br>
  A short time later, Trump's National Security Advisor Mike Waltz sent real-time intelligence on the aftermath of an attack, writing "Building collapsed. Had multiple positive ID" and "amazing job."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthi rebels, who have controlled much of Yemen for more than a decade, are part of the "axis of resistance" of pro-Iran groups staunchly opposed to Israel and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has stepped up attacks on the group in response to constant Houthi attempts to sink and disrupt shipping through the strategic Red Sea. (AFP)

    UK slashes growth forecast, cuts public spending

<img alt="UK finance minister Rachel Reeves delivers the Spring Statement spending update. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797575_1_20250326221849.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK government halved its 2025 growth forecast on Wednesday as it made billions of pounds of spendings cuts to shore up the public purse in the face of economic headwinds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spring Statement spending update came as the Labour government, elected in July after a landslide election win, faces sluggish economic growth and rising borrowing costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's economy is expected to grow by just one percent this year, revised down from an estimate of two percent made in late October when Labour gave its inaugural budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the UK's spending watchdog, upgraded the country's growth forecast for the three following years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our task is to secure Britain's future in a world that is changing before our eyes," finance minister Rachel Reeves told parliament in the highly-anticipated update.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns over US tariffs and the war in Ukraine have added to the UK's economic woes, chipping away the government's fiscal cushion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The threat facing our continent was transformed when [Russian President Vladimir] Putin invaded Ukraine," Reeves said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that "the job of a responsible government is not simply to watch this change, this moment requires an active government".
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recently pledged to hike spending on defence, with the government confirming Wednesday a £2.2 billion boost next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  To avoid slipping into a deficit, Reeves has cut disability welfare payments and government departmental budgets, blaming a period of heightened uncertainty in global markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Wednesday's update, the centre-left government announced it would slash the cost of running the civil service by 15 percent over the next five years, targeting annual savings of around £2 billion. (AFP)

    Seoul found responsible for abuse of adoptions process

<img alt="International adoptions from South Korea began after the Korean War as a way to remove mixed-race children. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797520_2_20250326170321.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean official enquiry said on Wednesday the government was responsible for abuse in international adoptions of local children, including record fabrication and inadequate consent, and recommended an official state apology.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It was determined that the state neglected its duty ... resulting in the violation of the human rights of adoptees protected by the constitution and international agreements during the process of sending a lot of children abroad," South Korea's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country remains one of the biggest ever exporters of babies in the world, having sent more than 140,000 children overseas between 1955 and 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  International adoptions began after the Korean War as a way to remove mixed-race children, born to local mothers and American GI fathers, from a country that emphasised ethnic homogeneity.
  <br>
  <br>
  It became big business in the 1970s to 1980s, bringing international adoption agencies millions of dollars as the country overcame post-war poverty and faced rapid and aggressive economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, the main driver has been babies born to unmarried women, who still face ostracism in a patriarchal society, and according to academics, are often forced to give up their children.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a landmark announcement, the country's truth commission concluded after a two-year and seven-month investigation that human rights violations occurred in international adoptions of South Korean children, including "fraudulent orphan registrations, identity tampering, and inadequate vetting of adoptive parents."
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said "numerous cases were identified where proper legal consent procedures" for South Korean birth parents were "not followed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission also said Seoul failed to regulate adoption fees, allowing agencies to set them through "internal agreements," effectively turning it into a profit-driven industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  And despite regulations requiring verification of adoptive parents' eligibility, an overwhelming majority, 99 percent, of intercountry adoption approvals in 1984 alone were granted on the same day or the following day, the commission said, citing its investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These violations should never have occurred," the commission's chairperson Park Sun-young said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a shameful part of our history," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For years, Korean adoptees have advocated for their rights, many reporting that their birth mothers were forced to give up their children, leading to the fabrication of records to make them legally adoptable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some South Korean birth parents and adoptees even claimed that their children were kidnapped – by agents who sought out unattended children in poor neighbourhoods – or that authorities directed lost children towards adoption without trying to reunite them with their families, in some cases intentionally changing the child's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some adoptees – such as Adam Crapser – were deported to South Korea as adults because their American parents never secured their US citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission confirmed human rights violations in only 56 out of 367 complaints, saying there was an overwhelming amount of data to try to verify, and said it would "make efforts" to review the remaining cases before its investigation expires on May 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some adoptees were dissatisfied with this outcome, urging the commission to fully recognise violations in all 367 cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without the truth, our lives rests upon guesses, estimations and creative narratives," Boonyoung Han, a Danish Korean adoptee, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are victims to state violence but without a trace! Literally. Destruction and withholding of our documents must not leave us open to eternal uncertainty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hanna Johansson, a Korean adoptee in Sweden, said she considers the commission's announcement a "victory" for her adoptee community regardless.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also hope that more and more South Korean [birth] parents who lost their child without their consent will come forward and demand justice," she said. (AFP)

    Seoul court clears opposition leader for top job run

<img alt="Lee Jae-myung appeals for patience outside the court in Seoul. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797498_1_20250326152240.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean appeals court reversed on Wednesday a lower court's ruling and found main opposition leader Lee Jae-myung not guilty of violating the election law, removing a barrier that could have blocked him from running for president.
 <br>
  <br>
  Following the ruling, Lee said the decision by the Seoul High Court completely vindicated him and proved the case was politically motivated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is truly outrageous that all this energy and national resources were spent for what is an obvious outcome," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was handed a one-year prison term suspended for two years by the Seoul Central District Court last year, a penalty that if it had been upheld would have jeopardised his bid to run in the next presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appeals court reversed the earlier ruling that had found Lee guilty of making a false claim during a parliamentary audit in 2021 while running as a presidential candidate about a land development project in Seongnam where he served as mayor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court cases have shone a spotlight on Lee since opinion polls show he is the frontrunner to replace President Yoon Suk yeol if the embattled leader's impeachment is upheld.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea will hold a snap election within 60 days if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment of Yoon over his short-lived declaration of martial law in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party is regarded as by far the top contender for the next presidential election but faces legal challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was unclear if the prosecution would decide to appeal Wednesday's court decision at the Supreme Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the election law violation case, he also faces several other trials on matters ranging from bribery to charges mostly linked to a US$1-billion property development scandal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In South Korea, if lawmakers are convicted of violating the election law and given a fine of one million won or more or even a suspended sentence and the conviction becomes finalised, they are barred from running for elections for at least five years and stripped of their parliament seat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, 61, ran against Yoon in the 2022 presidential election and lost by the slimmest margin in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, he survived a knife attack when he was stabbed in the neck by a man during an event and underwent surgery. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday, defeating a challenge from opposition parties who accused her of being a puppet of her father, billionaire ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a two-day censure debate in which the opposition attacked 38-year-old Paetongtarn's management of the country and her inexperience, MPs voted down the no-confidence motion by 319 votes to 162, with seven abstentions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn thanked her supporters after winning the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All votes, both for and against, will be a force driving me and the cabinet to carry on working hard for the people," she wrote on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thaksin, the most influential but controversial politician of modern Thai history, returned to the kingdom in 2023 after 15 years of self-exile.
  <br>
  <br>
  He served a few months of an eight-year jail sentence for historic graft and abuse of power charges in a police hospital before being pardoned by the king, fuelling rumours of a backroom deal to treat him leniently.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 75-year-old remains popular among millions of poorer Thais who prospered under his 2001-2006 rule but is despised by the kingdom's conservative elite who regard him as corrupt and manipulative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn became prime minister last year at the head of a coalition government led by the Pheu Thai party – the latest incarnation of the political movement founded by Thaksin – after the incumbent Srettha Thavisin was thrown out by a court order.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the censure debate Rangsiman Rome, an outspoken lawmaker with the main opposition People's Party, accused Paetongtarn of engineering preferential treatment for her father.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You made a deal, a demon deal, to get your father better conditions than other prisoners," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The condition was your father will not be in jail for a single day."
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn denied the allegation, pointing out that she only became prime minister several months after her father's royal pardon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition MPs also accused Paetongtarn of avoiding tax. (AFP)

<img alt="About 20 of 30 buildings and structures in the Gounsa temple complex, including two of South Korea's three state-designated 'treasures,' in Uiseong were burned to the ground. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797453_1_20250326115256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildfires in South Korea have killed 24 people, officials said on Wednesday, warning that the toll in one of South Korea's worst wildfire outbreaks could rise further, with more people injured and the blaze still not under control.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Twenty four people are confirmed dead in the wildfires so far," and 12 seriously injured, a ministry of interior and safety official said, adding that these were "preliminary figures" and the toll could rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blazes are causing "unprecedented damage," acting president Han Duck-soo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen different blazes broke out over the weekend, with the death toll jumping overnight as one major fire tore through villages and burned a historical temple to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has raised the crisis alert to its highest level and declared a "a full-scale national response" to bring the fires under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dry, windy weather has hampered efforts to contain the fires, with the government taking the rare step of evacuating thousands of prisoners out of detention centres in affected counties.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, authorities issued an emergency alert for Hahoe Folk Village – a Unesco-listed world heritage site popular with tourists – as the blaze drew closer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wildfires burning for a fifth-consecutive day in Ulsan and the Gyeongsang region are causing unprecedented damage," Han said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told an emergency safety and disaster meeting that the blazes were "developing in a way that is exceeding both existing prediction models and earlier expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities launched emergency evacuations on Tuesday afternoon "but sadly, casualties could not be prevented," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Throughout the night, chaos continued as power and communication lines were cut in several areas and roads were blocked," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of firefighters have been deployed, but "strong winds reaching speeds of 25 metres per second persisted from yesterday afternoon through the night, forcing the suspension of helicopter and drone operations," Han said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Constantly shifting wind directions and ongoing dry weather advisories have revealed the limitations of conventional firefighting methods," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said the government has launched a "full-scale national response".
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuees sheltering in the gym of Sinsung elementary school said the fire had hit their villages so quickly they did not have time to take anything with them as they fled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The wind was so strong," Kwon So-han, a 79-year-old resident in Andong said, adding that as soon as he got the evacuation order he fled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fire came from the mountain and fell on my house," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those who haven't experienced it won't know. I could only bring my body."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain is forecast for late Wednesday, with authorities hoping to capitalise on even a light sprinkling to help extinguish the fires. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A months-long investigation into the mysterious death of a French toddler took a surprise turn on Tuesday when police arrested four people including the boy's grandparents on suspicion of murder and concealment of a body.
 <br>
  <br>
  The death of Emile Soleil, a boy of two-and-a-half who went missing in a French Alpine village in July 2023, had remained unexplained even after some of his remains were discovered nine months later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors at the time said the cause of his death could have been "a fall, manslaughter or murder".
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile had been staying at the summer home of his maternal grandparents in the tiny hamlet of Le Haut-Vernet when he vanished. Emile's mother and father were absent on the day he disappeared.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a sharp turn of events on Tuesday, the boy's 59-year-old grandfather, Philippe Vedovini, and his wife were arrested on suspicion of voluntary homicide and concealment of a corpse, said Aix-en-Provence public prosecutor Jean-Luc Blachon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two adult children of the couple were also arrested, Blachon added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's arrests were the result of fact-finding "over recent months", the prosecutor told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month investigators had returned to the village, sparking talk of a development in the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  A large flowerpot with traces of blood had been seized by the investigators in front of a local church, a source close to the case told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several years ago the boy's grandfather had been questioned over alleged violence and sexual assault at a private school in the 1990s where he was a scout leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had initially considered his possible involvement in Emile's death as only one of many hypotheses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Perhaps what is happening is not what we had expected," said Philippe Vedovini's lawyer, Isabelle Colombani, when questioned by police in Marseille.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she added that "being placed in police custody means nothing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Julien Pinelli, who represents Emile's grandmother, Anne Vedovini, said that she wanted nothing more than to learn "the truth about this tragedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And if this measure is necessary to find the truth, of course she will submit to it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the southern village of La Bouilladisse, an AFP reporter saw police conduct a search of the couple's main home, an affluent farmhouse. They have seized an SUV and a horse trailer.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the neighbours, who did not wish to give his name, saw the police detain Vedovini, who is an osteopath, and his wife at 7 am in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, they're quiet neighbours," he said. "They've been under pressure for the past two years, that's for sure. They have lived in a reclusive manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile was last seen walking alone on a street in Le Vernet, 1,200 metres (4,000 feet) up in the French Alps, in the late afternoon of July 8, 2023. He was wearing a yellow T-shirt, white shorts and tiny hiking shoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A massive search failed to find any sign of the boy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nine months later, a walker discovered his skull and teeth 1.7 kilometres from the village.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later found more bones and items of the boy's clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February, a traditional Catholic funeral mass for the toddler was held in the Basilica of Sainte-Marie-Madeleine, a Unesco-listed medieval Gothic cathedral said to house relics of Mary Magdalene, a follower of Jesus Christ.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several hundred mourners were in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile's grandparents and parents are devout Catholics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Within hours of the ceremony, the grandparents published a statement saying "the period of silence must yield to the period of truth."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to understand. We need to know," they said. (AFP)

    Deals reached on Ukraine maritime and energy truce

<img alt="Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov talks to reporters after US-Russia talks on a Ukraine ceasefire. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797401_1_20250326063126.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States reached deals on Tuesday with Ukraine and Russia to pause attacks at sea and against energy targets, with Washington agreeing to push to lift some sanctions against Moscow in its latest step towards endorsing Russia's positions.
 <br>
  <br>
  The separate agreements are the first formal commitments by the warring sides since the inauguration of Donald Trump, who is pushing for an end to the war and a rapid rapprochement with Moscow that has alarmed Kyiv and European countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US agreement with Russia goes further than the agreement with Ukraine, with Washington committing to help seek the lifting of international sanctions on Russian agriculture and fertiliser exports, long a persistent Russian demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said the Black Sea agreements would not come into effect unless links between some Russian banks and the international financial system were restored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said this was untrue, and there was no requirement of sanctions relief for the deals to come into force.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, even now, even today, on the very day of negotiations, we see how the Russians have already begun to manipulate," Zelensky said in his nightly video address. "They are already trying to distort agreements and, in fact, deceive both our intermediaries and the entire world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv and Moscow both said they would rely on Washington to enforce the deals, while expressing scepticism that the other side would abide by them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: "We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelensky and his team to do one thing and not the other."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said the truce agreements would take effect immediately, and that if Russia violated them he would ask Trump to impose additional sanctions on Moscow and provide more weapons for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have no faith in the Russians, but we will be constructive," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deals were reached after parallel talks in Saudi Arabia that followed separate phone calls last week between Trump and the two presidents, Zelensky and Vladimir Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin rejected Trump's proposal for a full ceasefire lasting 30 days, which Ukraine had previously endorsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Washington has nevertheless softened its rhetoric towards Russia in recent days, with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff saying he did not "regard Putin as a bad guy", alarming European officials who consider the Russian leader a dangerous enemy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said Kyiv would regard any movement of Russian military vessels outside the eastern part of the Black Sea as a violation and a threat, in which case Ukraine would have the full right to self-defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has attacked Ukraine's power grid with missiles and drones throughout the war, arguing that civil energy infrastructure is a legitimate target because it helps Ukraine's warfighting capability.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, Ukraine has been launching long-range strikes on Russian oil and gas targets, which it says provide fuel for Russia's troops and income to fund its war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said the pause in attacks on energy would last for 30 days from March 18, when Putin first discussed it with Trump. Ukraine had said last week that it would accept such a pause only after a formal agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement on a truce at sea addresses an issue that was critical early in the war, when Russia imposed a de facto naval blockade on Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain exporters, worsening a global food crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, maritime battles have been only a comparatively small part of the war since Russia withdrew its naval forces from the eastern Black Sea after a number of successful Ukrainian attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv has been able to reopen its ports and resume exports at around pre-war levels, despite the collapse of a previous UN-brokered Black Sea shipping agreement, but its ports have come under regular air attack. Zelensky said the agreement would bar such strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow said the agreement would require sanctions relief including restoring links between Russia's agricultural export bank and the Swift international payments system. That and other steps could require agreement from European countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has been pressing Moscow and Kyiv to bring a rapid end to the war, a goal he promised to achieve when he ran for president last year. At the same time he is pursuing a rapid rapprochement with Russia that Washington and Moscow say could lead to lucrative business opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine and its European allies fear Trump could strike a hasty deal with Putin that undermines their security and caves in to Russian demands, including for Kyiv to abandon its Nato ambitions and give up land claimed by Moscow. (Reuters)

<img alt="Gerard Depardieu, 76, has been accused of improper behaviour by around 20 women but this is the first case to come to trial. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797392_1_20250326035129.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 French star actor Gerard Depardieu, on trial for sexual assault, told the Paris court on Tuesday that he was not in the habit of "groping" women, and called the #MeToo movement a "reign of terror".
 <br>
  <br>
  "I don't see why I would go around groping a woman, her buttocks, her breasts," Depardieu said in his first statement at the trial, in which he is charged with sexual assault on two women during the shooting of a film in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not somebody who rubs himself against others on the metro," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu said he was "not like that" in response to the accusations, adding that "there are vices that are alien to me".
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu, 76, who has acted in more than 200 films and television series, has been accused of improper behaviour by around 20 women but this is the first case to come to trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I deny all of it," the actor, dressed in black, said in the packed courtroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's response to the #MeToo movement, which he told the court on Tuesday "will become a reign of terror".
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial relates to charges of sexual assault during the filming in 2021 of "Les Volets Verts" ("The Green Shutters") by director Jean Becker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anouk Grinberg, a prominent actor who appeared in the film, has backed the two plaintiffs – a set dresser, 54, identified only as Amelie, and a 34-year-old assistant director. Both women allege sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another prominent actor Fanny Ardant is expected to testify in favour of Depardieu later this week. (AFP)

    Trump, intel chiefs dismiss chat breach

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump and his top intelligence officials raced on Tuesday to stem a growing scandal after a journalist was accidentally added to a group chat about air strikes on Yemen's Houthi rebels in a security breach.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump brushed off the leak as a "glitch," while the CIA director and the White House intelligence chief both claimed during a Senate hearing that no classified information was divulged in the conversation on the Signal messaging app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also defended his National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who added Atlantic's magazine's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the chat by mistake ahead of the air strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told broadcaster NBC that the breach was "the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one". Waltz "has learned a lesson, and he's a good man," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe – who were both reported to be in the chat – both endured a stormy Senate Intelligence Committee hearing over the leak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was no classified material that was shared," Gabbard, who has previously caused controversy with comments sympathetic to Russia and Syria, told the committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  She refused however to comment on whether Signal had been installed on her personal phone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ratcliffe confirmed he was involved in the Signal group and had the app installed on his work computer, but said the communications were "entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information".
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats on the committee called on Waltz and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to resign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senator Mark Warner blasted what he called "sloppy, careless, incompetent behaviour". (AFP)

    Vietnam death row tycoon begins appeal

<img alt="Vietnamese property tycoon Truong My Lan (centre) looks on at a court in Ho Chi Minh City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797356_1_20250325193707.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The appeal of a Vietnamese property tycoon convicted of money laundering began on Tuesday, three months after she lost a challenge against the death penalty in a separate case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Property developer Truong My Lan was found guilty in April 2024 of stealing money from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) and sentenced to death for fraud amounting to US$27 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan appealed against that verdict and the court said there was no basis to reduce her sentence, but ruled that she could still escape the death penalty if she returned three quarters of the stolen assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now she is appealing against the verdict from a second trial in October, in which she was sentenced to life in prison for three crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday Lan, now accustomed to high-profile hearings, chatted with police officers and looked relatively relaxed as she waited for the court to start in Ho Chi Minh City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her niece, who was handed a five-year prison term in October for fraudulent appropriation of property, sat behind her, flanked by officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 68-year-old was found guilty of laundering US$17.7 billion and illegal cross-border trafficking of US$4.5 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was also found guilty of bond fraud to the tune of US$1.2 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court determined that Lan was "the mastermind, committed the crime with sophisticated methods, many times, causing especially serious consequences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-three other defendants were also sentenced at the court in Ho Chi Minh City and given terms ranging from two to 23 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-seven of them are appealing against their sentences, state media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During her first trial in April, Lan was found guilty of embezzling US$12.5 billion but prosecutors said the total damages caused by the scam totalled US$27 billion - equivalent to around six percent of the country's 2023 GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan owned just five percent of shares in SCB on paper but at her trial the court concluded that she effectively controlled more than 90 percent through family, friends and staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tens of thousands of people who had invested their savings in the bank lost money, shocking the communist nation and prompting rare protests from the victims. (AFP)

    Microplastics fear for those who chew gum

<img alt="Researchers say a gram of gum releases an average of 100 microplastic fragments and that some shed more than 600. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797333_1_20250325172205.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chewing gum releases hundreds of tiny plastic pieces straight into people's mouths, researchers said on Tuesday, also warning of the pollution created by the rubber-based sweet.
 <br>
  <br>
  The small study comes as researchers have increasingly been discovering small shards of plastic called microplastics throughout the world, from the tops of mountains to the bottom of the ocean – and even in the air we breathe.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also been discovered microplastics riddled throughout human bodies – including inside our lungs, blood and brains – sparking fears about the potential effect this could be having on health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want to alarm people," said Sanjay Mohanty, the lead researcher behind the new study.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is no evidence directly showing that microplastics are harmful to human health, said Mohanty of the University of California, Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new pilot study instead sought to illustrate yet another little-researched way that these mostly invisible plastic pieces enter our bodies  – chewing gum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lisa Lowe, a PhD student at UCLA, chewed seven pieces each of 10 brands of gum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then the researchers ran a chemical analysis on her saliva.
  <br>
  <br>
  They found that a gram of gum released an average of 100 microplastic fragments, though some shed more than 600.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average weight of a stick of gum is around 1.5 grams.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who chew around 180 pieces of gum a year could be ingesting roughly 30,000 microplastics, the researchers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This pales in comparison to the many other ways that humans ingest microplastics, Mohanty emphasised.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, other researchers estimated last year that a litre of water in a plastic bottle contained an average of 240,000 microplastics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most common chewing gum sold in supermarkets is called synthetic gum, which contains petroleum-based polymers to get that chewy effect, the researchers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, packaging does not list any plastics in the ingredients, simply using the words "gum-based."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohanty said that "nobody will tell you the ingredients."
  <br>
  <br>
  The researchers tested five brands of synthetic gum and five of natural gum, which use plant-based polymers such as tree sap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was surprising that we found microplastics were abundant in both," Lowe said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gum shed almost all of the microplastics during the first eight minutes of chewing, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Jones, a researcher at the UK's University of Portsmouth not involved in the study, said manufacturers should be forced to give more specific ingredients than just "gum-based."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones said he was surprised that the researchers found certain plastics not known to be in gum, suggesting they could have possibly come from another source.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the overall findings were "not at all surprising", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  People tend to "freak out a little bit" when told that the building blocks of chewing gum were similar to what is found "in car tyres, plastic bags and bottles", Jones said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowe also warned about the plastic pollution from chewing gum – particularly when people "spit it out onto the sidewalk".
  <br>
  <br>
  The study, which has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal but not yet published, was presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former member of Germany's far-left Baader-Meinhof gang who was arrested last year after more than 30 years on the run will face trial on Tuesday for a series of armed robberies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Daniela Klette, 66, was part of the radical anti-capitalist group also known as the Red Army Faction, which carried out a series of bombings, kidnappings and killings in the 1970s and 1980s.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was arrested in February 2024 at her Berlin flat, where police found a Kalashnikov assault rifle, explosives and large sums of cash, after apparently hiding there in plain sight for two decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks earlier, the creators of a German "most wanted" podcast had stumbled across photos of Klette on Facebook attending capoeira classes in Berlin, though it is unclear whether this led to her arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial starting on Tuesday in the northern city of Celle relates to robberies Klette allegedly committed with two other gang members to finance their life on the run after the RAF disbanded in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  After she was detained, prosecutors also had Klette formally arrested on suspicion of involvement in three attacks in the 1990s, while the gang was still active.
  <br>
  <br>
  Named after two of its early leaders, Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, the Baader-Meinhof gang emerged out of the radical fringe of the 1960s student protest movement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's members took up arms against what they saw as US imperialism and a "fascist" German state that was still riddled with former Nazis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the height of its notoriety in 1977, the group shot dead a German bank chief and kidnapped and killed industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, a former SS officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the so-called German Autumn of 1977 marked the beginning of a long period of decline for the RAF, the group continued to operate for another two decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette was part of a notorious trio – along with fellow gang members Ernst-Volker Staub and Burkhard Garweg – who were active as part of the RAF's "third generation" in the 1980s and 1990s.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the RAF disbanded, Klette and the two men are believed to have financed their lives in hiding through armed robberies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are still searching for Staub and Garweg, who would now be 71 and 56 if they are still alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial in Celle relates to four attacks on money transporters and nine cash heists from shops in which the suspects got away with a total of 2.7 million euros, according to prosecutors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette is said to have acted mainly as the getaway driver but also faces one charge of attempted murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said she carried a "realistic-looking" dummy bazooka during some of the heists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial is set to last around two years and will hear from 12 witnesses, according to the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette reportedly put up no resistance when she was arrested at her apartment in Berlin's bohemian Kreuzberg neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to German media reports, she had been using a fake Italian passport and going by the name of Claudia Ivone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neighbours told the Bild daily she had a partner about the same age as her and always said "hello" when she went out walking with her dog.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette had no bank account and likely paid her rent in cash, possibly for several months or years at a time, according to Der Spiegel magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attacks Klette is accused of committing in the 1990s, which are being dealt with in separate proceedings, include an attempted assault on a Deutsche Bank building in Eschborn, near Frankfurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is also accused of playing a role in a 1991 RAF attack on the US embassy in Bonn, which was the German capital at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third accusation relates to a 1993 explosives attack against a prison then still under construction in Germany's Hesse state. (AFP)

    Abe assassination probe leads to church's dissolution

<img alt="The Unification Church's Tokyo headquarters in Shibuya. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797307_1_20250325151020.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A court ordered the dissolution of the Unification Church in Japan, upholding a government request for a revocation spurred by the investigation into the 2022 assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Tokyo District Court’s revocation of the church’s legal status means it will lose its tax-exempt privilege and must liquidate its assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the church can still appeal the decision to higher courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order follows a request by Japan’s Education Ministry in 2023 to dissolve the influential South Korea-based sect, citing manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese branch of the church had criticized the request as a serious threat to religious freedom and the human rights of its followers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation into the 2022 assassination of Abe revealed decades of cozy ties between the South Korea-based church and Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The church obtained legal status as a religious organization in Japan in 1968 amid an anti-communist movement supported by Abe’s grandfather, former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man accused of killing Abe resented the church and blamed it for his family's financial troubles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The church, which officially calls itself the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, is the first religious group to face a revocation order under Japan’s civil code.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two earlier case involved criminal charges – the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan has in place hurdles for restraining religious activities due to lessons from the prewar and wartime oppression of freedom of religion and thought.

    Giant sinkhole swallows motorcyclist in Seoul

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One person has been killed after a massive sinkhole opened up in Seoul, the fire department said on Tuesday, with harrowing video footage showing the moment his vehicle was swallowed by the hole.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vast hole opened up at an intersection in the southeast of the South Korean capital during the evening rush hour around 6.30 pm on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dashcam footage by a local lawmaker shows the hole appearing abruptly in the middle of a busy street, with a motorbike being swallowed up instantly as a car narrowly escapes the same fate, sliding into the hole before somehow bouncing out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire department conducted a major search, with rescue workers wearing wetsuits and "digging with their hands" alongside a rescue dog, in a frantic 17-hour hunt for the motorcyclist.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, on Tuesday "the missing person who is in his thirties, was discovered in cardiac arrest, approximately 50 metres from the centerline of the sinkhole," said Kim Chang-seop, an official from the Gangdong Fire Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was buried at a depth of approximately 90 centimeters and was found intact, still wearing his helmet and motorcycle boots," said Kim, adding they "regret that we are unable to deliver better news."
  <br>
  <br>
  The driver of the car suffered minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hole is now around 20 metres wide and 20 metres deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of schools nearby closed on Tuesday, citing safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the sinkhole will be investigated, but the accident occurred at a site where extension work for a metro line was underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul city official said it was clear the construction could have been one of "several possible contributing factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were several factors at play. Once the surrounding soil and debris are cleared, we will conduct a full investigation into the cause of the accident with a team of experts," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinkhole accidents are rare in South Korea, with fewer than 200 reported cases every year on average – significantly less than the number recorded in Japan. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land", Hamdan Ballal, was attacked by settlers and arrested by the Israeli army on Monday in the occupied West Bank, according to his co-director Yuval Abraham.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a post on X, Abraham said a "group of settlers" had set upon Ballal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They beat him and he has injuries in his head and stomach, bleeding. Soldiers invaded the ambulance he called, and took him. No sign of him since," Abraham wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident took place in the southern West Bank village of Susiya, according to the anti-occupation NGO Center for Jewish Nonviolence, whose members said they filmed the events first-hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army said it was verifying the information when questioned by AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No Other Land", which was directed by Israeli-Palestinian activists, won best documentary at this year's Academy Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shot in nearby Masafer Yatta, the documentary follows a young Palestinian struggling with forced displacement as the Israeli army tears down his community's homes to make space for a firing zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The West Bank, excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, is home to around three million Palestinians as well as nearly half a million Israelis who live in settlements that are illegal under international law. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European sales of Tesla electric cars dropped 49 percent in January and February compared with the same period a year earlier, the ACEA manufacturers' association said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ageing models are one factor behind the plunge, but electric vehicle clients may also be refusing to buy in protest of Tesla's billionaire owner Elon Musk since he became a key supporter of US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has been leading a vocal and divisive cost-cutting drive at the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Tesla dealerships around the United States have been vandalised in recent weeks and the company's stock price has plummeted over the past month.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Tesla registrations in the European Union fell to 19,046 in the first two months of the year, giving the company a market share of just 1.1 percent, the ACEA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February alone, Tesla registrations were down 47 percent at 11,743.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sales drop came even as overall electric vehicle sales jumped 28.4 percent over the first two months of this year to 255,489 – for an EU market share of 15.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But for ACEA director general Sigrid de Vries, "The latest new car registration figures confirm that market demand for battery electric vehicles remains below the level needed for the transition to zero-emission mobility to progress."
  <br>
  <br>
  She cited a need for tax and purchasing incentives for clients and investments in recharging stations, at a time when the EU is preparing to ease emission reduction targets for struggling European automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hybrid-electric vehicles continued to be the biggest market segment in the first two months of the year, rising to 594,059 registrations – for a 35.2 percent market share.
  <br>
  <br>
  That outpaced both petrol and diesel models, with market shares of 29.1 percent and 9.7 percent in February. (AFP)

 Chinese authorities have released all employees of a US corporate due diligence firm detained in Beijing two years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The detained Beijing employees at Mintz Group, all Chinese nationals, have been freed, a company official said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of their release came on the heels of the just-concluded China Development Forum in Beijing attended by dozens of foreign chief executives, a platform that Chinese officials had used to bring home the message that China is open to foreign capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are grateful to the Chinese authorities that our former colleagues can now be home with their families," the Mintz official said in an email.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mintz has 12 offices around the world and more than 280 investigators, according to its website. (Reuters)

 Boeing is seeking to withdraw an agreement to plead guilty in a criminal case that blamed the company for deceiving regulators before two deadly crashes of 737 MAX jets, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A US judge in December rejected the deal, faulting a diversity and inclusion provision, and Boeing and the Justice Department have been negotiating a new agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump took over on January 20, giving his administration a chance to weigh in on the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing declined comment. The Justice Department did not immediately comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge in the wake of two fatal 737 MAX crashes. The planemaker also agreed to pay a fine of up to US$487.2 million and spend US$455 million to improve safety and compliance practices over three years of court-supervised probation as part of the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives of the victims of the two 737 MAX crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019 and killed 346 people, have called the plea agreement a "sweetheart" deal that failed to adequately hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of their loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  An accepted plea deal would brand Boeing a convicted felon for conspiring to defraud the US Federal Aviation Administration about problematic software affecting the flight control systems in the planes that crashed.
  <br>
  <br>
  In May, the Justice Department found Boeing had violated the terms of a 2021 agreement that had shielded it from prosecution over the crashes. Prosecutors then decided to criminally charge Boeing and negotiate the current plea deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision followed a January 5, 2024, in-flight blowout of a door panel on an Alaska Airlines' jet that exposed ongoing safety and quality issues at Boeing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth, Texas in 2023 said "Boeing's crime may properly be considered the deadliest corporate crime in US history."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump administration officials have said regulators must be firm with Boeing after a series of missteps.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to be tougher on Boeing. We need to be tougher on the industry," said Steve Bradbury, who was confirmed as deputy transportation secretary this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing on Friday won a contract to build the US Air Force's most sophisticated fighter jet yet. (Reuters)

 The United Nations said Monday it would “reduce its footprint” in Gaza after an Israeli tank strike hit one of its compounds last week, killing one staff member from Bulgaria and wounding five other employees.
 <br>
  <br>
  UN Secretary-General spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said the world body would temporarily remove about a third of its approximately 100 international staffers working in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed to the increased danger after Israel relaunched its military campaign last week with bombardment that has since killed hundreds of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has also cut off all food, medicine, aid and other supplies to Gaza's population for the past three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujarric's statement was the UN's first to point the finger at Israel in the March 19 explosion at the UN guesthouse in central Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that “based on the information currently available,” the strikes on the site “were caused by an Israeli tank.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military repeated its denial that it was responsible for the strike, which took place a day after Israel shattered Gaza's two-month-old ceasefire with a surprise bombardment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujarric said the UN had "taken the difficult decision to reduce the Organization’s footprint in Gaza, even as humanitarian needs soar.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the UN was “not leaving Gaza,” pointing out that it still had about 13,000 national staff in Gaza, mainly working for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. (AP)

    'Trump's fees on Chinese ships will backfire'

<img alt="A container ship sails beneath the Golden Gate Bridge as it makes its way into port in San Francisco. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797249_1_20250325083906.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump's plan to revitalise the US shipbuilding industry is likely to backfire because it relies on proposed fees on China-linked vessels that will hurt domestic ship operators, seaports, exporters and jobs, industry executives said at US Trade Representative (USTR) hearings on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At issue are proposed stacking fees on China-built vessels that could top US$3 million per US port call.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration says the fees would curb China's growing commercial and military dominance on the high seas and promote domestically built vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  US steelworker unions, US steel producers and Democratic lawmakers support the effort, saying it will boost domestic industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the idea has sent a shockwave through the domestic maritime industry because it threatens the survival of the same shipping companies and customers that would drive demand for orders from the US shipyards Trump wants to rebuild.
  <br>
  <br>
  "National interest will not be served if the effort to boost American shipbuilding unintentionally destroys American-owned carriers," Edward Gonzalez, CEO of Florida-based Seaboard Marine, the largest US-owned international ocean cargo carrier, testified on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like many US operators, Seaboard relies on vessels made in China. It has 16 China-built ships in its fleet of 24 vessels, according to maritime data provider Alphaliner.
  <br>
  <br>
  US vessel operators said the fees on Chinese-linked vessels also would push more US cargo to foreign-owned ocean shipping companies that have resources to better weather the change.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the USTR, China's share of the shipbuilding market grew from less than five percent in 1999 to more than 50 percent in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  US shipyards turn out fewer than 10 ships annually while China's produce 1,000, speakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, industry executives said shipbuilders in Japan and South Korea would struggle to meet demand in the years it would take US shipyards to build up capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Replacing existing China-built vessels is not like flipping a light switch, said Kathy Metcalf, CEO of the Chamber of Shipping of America. "Penalising China and the US marine transportation system is not an acceptable result." (Reuters)

    Procedural matters cloud first day of Depardieu trial

<div class="itemFullText">
 The tense first day of the trial of French actor Gerard Depardieu over sexual assault allegations ended on Monday, with both sides trading jabs on their approach to the legal procedure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu is on trial over alleged sexual assaults on a film set, in a case that placed one of France's best-known movie stars at the heart of the country's broader reckoning over sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  A towering figure of French cinema, Depardieu has faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations in recent years. Depardieu, 76, has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and this is the first case for which he would be standing trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu's lawyer Jeremie Assous said the plaintiffs' refusal to conduct legal examination procedures, including a medical expertise, show that they "fear the truth, because once again, the truth is on our side."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, the lawyer of one of the plaintiffs, said Depardieu's camp had been avoiding debate on the substance and is trying to prolong the legal process as much as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The procedural incidents that are stalling, those can cause stress among the victims," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial, expected to last at least two days, and possibly more, was initially due to be held in October but was postponed due to Depardieu's ill health. It will resume on Tuesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  If found guilty, Depardieu could face a sentence of up to five years in jail and a 75,000-euro (US$81,000) fine. (Reuters)

    Venezuelan oil tariffs condemned as 'illegal'
   </title>

<img alt="An oil tanker near the Venezuelan port of La Salina. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797246_1_20250325082707.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Tuesday called on the United States to stop interfering in Venezuela's internal affairs and abolish the "illegal" unilateral sanctions on the South American country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The call came soon after US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas, a punitive measure that could hit China and India, among others, and sow fresh global trade uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has unleashed tariffs on US allies and foes alike, attempting to strong-arm both economic and diplomatic policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest across-the-board 25 percent levies targeting direct and indirect buyers of Venezuelan oil can take effect as soon as April 2, according to an order signed on Monday by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary of state, in consultation with other US agencies, is authorised to determine if the levy will be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  These could hit China and India, with experts noting that Venezuela exports oil to both those countries, and to the United States and Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters on Monday that the 25 percent tariff would be on top of existing rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February, Venezuela exported some 500,000 barrels of oil per day to China and this figure was 240,000 barrels for the United States, experts told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has dubbed April 2 "Liberation Day" for the world's biggest economy, already promising reciprocal tariffs tailored to each trading partner in an effort to remedy practices that Washington deem unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  He earlier signaled sector-specific duties coming around the same day -- but the White House said on Monday it might take a narrower approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his Monday announcement on Truth Social involving Venezuela, the president cited "numerous reasons" for what he called a "secondary tariff."
  <br>
  <br>
  He accused Venezuela of "purposefully and deceitfully" sending "undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals" to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added in his post that "Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Trump's order, the 25 percent tariff expires a year after the last date that a country has imported Venezuelan oil -- or sooner if Washington decides so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's announcement comes as the deportation pipeline between the United States and Venezuela was suspended last month when he claimed Caracas had not lived up to a deal to quickly receive deported migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela subsequently said it would no longer accept the flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Caracas said on Saturday it had reached agreement with Washington to resume repatriations after which nearly 200 Venezuelan citizens were deported from the United States via Honduras.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately on Monday, the Trump administration extended US oil giant Chevron's deadline to halt its operations in Venezuela through May 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company had been operating in Venezuela under a sanctions waiver.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's latest move adds to tariffs he has vowed would start on or around April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides reciprocal tariffs, he has promised sweeping sector-specific duties hitting imported automobiles, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  As things stand, however, his plans for the day might become more targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sector-specific tariffs "may or may not happen April 2," a White House official told AFP, adding that the situation is "still fluid."
  <br>
  <br>
  The official reaffirmed that reciprocal tariffs would take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump told reporters on Monday he might "give a lot of countries breaks" eventually, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  He separately added that he would announce car tariffs "very shortly" and those on pharmaceuticals sometime down the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  US partners are furthering talks with Washington as deadlines loom, with EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic heading to the country on Tuesday to meet his American counterparts -- Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of a narrower tariff rollout gave financial markets a boost.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo last week that Washington would go to trading partners with an indication of where tariff levels and non-tariff barriers are.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stopped their practices, Bessent added, they could potentially avoid levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same interview, Bessent noted that levies would be focused on about 15 percent of countries who have trade imbalances with the United States, dubbing these a "dirty 15." (AFP/Xinhua)

    Journalist included in Houthi strike messaging group

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top Trump administration officials, including US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, mistakenly included a journalist in a messaging group discussing strikes against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis, according to a firsthand account by The Atlantic magazine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg said in a report on Monday that he was inadvertently invited on March 13 to an encrypted chat group on the Signal messaging app called the "Houthi PC small group." In the group, national security adviser Mike Waltz tasked his deputy Alex Wong with setting up a "tiger team" to coordinate US action against the Houthis.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump launched an ongoing campaign of large-scale military strikes against Yemen's Houthis on March 15 over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping, and he has warned Iran, the Houthis' main backer, that it needed to immediately halt support for the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours before those attacks started, Hegseth posted operational details about the plan, "including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing," Goldberg said, declining to disclose the details of what he termed the "shockingly reckless" use of the Signal chat to coordinate the strike.

  , RTHK's US correspondent Simon Marks said the extent of the leak was astonishing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is absolutely breathtaking. It is jaw dropping. It breaches every single national security protocol that not only this government in the United States would traditionally follow, but that governments all over the world would follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Marks said it was more likely a mistake rather than a deliberate leak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It certainly appears to have been a monumental accident, but also it raises massive questions about how many more sensitive government national security conversations have been taking place across commercially available apps."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Defence Department referred a Reuters request for comment to the National Security Council, and NSC spokesman Brian Hughes said the chat group appeared to be authentic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security," Hughes said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Monday faced a no-confidence motion in parliament as the opposition alleged she was being unduly influenced by her father, a former prime minister, and is mismanaging the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn, who took office last year, is expected to survive her first no-confidence vote on Wednesday with the backing of her ruling coalition that makes up the majority of the House of Representatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the opposition in parliament, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, said Paetongtarn had failed to address many of the country’s chronic problems including the slumping economy, air pollution, crimes and corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said her administration was serving the interests of her family and her father, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a popular but highly controversial political figure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn heads the Pheu Thai Party, the latest in a string of populist parties affiliated with Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup, fled into exile and recently returned to Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thaksin has been at the heart of nearly two decades of deep political divisions pitting a mostly poor, rural majority that supported him against royalists, the military and their urban backers, who accuse him of threatening their status and that of the revered monarchy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Natthapong is the leader of the People’s Party , a resurrection of the progressive, reformist Move Forward Party, which took the most seats in the general election in 2023 but failed to take power due to strong opposition from the conservative establishment, and was ordered dissolved.
  <br>

  Natthapong said the formation of the ruling coalition, which saw Pheu Thai partner with its former conservative rivals, was part of the political bargain to bring Thaksin home .

<img alt="The National Grid's boss, John Pettigrew, says either of the two other substations could have supplied the power to keep Heathrow open on Friday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the UK's national grid has said there was "enough power" to keep Heathrow Airport running on Friday, after an electrical substation fire shuttered Europe's busiest air hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shutdown, which lasted most of the day, affected thousands of passengers around the world and raised questions about the reliability of one of the UK's key pieces of infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Grid chief executive John Pettigrew told the Financial Times on Sunday that power had remained available to the airport in west London through two other substations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was no lack of capacity from the substations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Losing a substation is a unique event – but there were two others available."
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport officials said the closure was due to the time it took to switch to the other substations and make safety checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted," a Heathrow Airport official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given Heathrow's size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge."
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye had said a back-up transformer failed, meaning systems had to be closed so power supplies could be restructured from the two other substations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has ordered a six-week investigation into the shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 1,350 flights were affected by Friday's closure, according to the Flightradar24 tracking website. Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced and had to be diverted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire officials have said the blaze, which broke out on Thursday night, was "believed to be non-suspicious" and that enquiries would "focus on the electrical distribution equipment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked on Monday about the way airport bosses handled the events, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: "I'm not going to justify decisions that Heathrow leadership did or didn't take."  (AFP)

    US-Russia talks on Ukraine begin in Saudi Arabia

<img alt="Different plans for temporary ceasefires in the Ukraine war have been proposed, but attacks have continued unabated. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797165_1_20250324162833.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US and Russian officials opened talks in Saudi Arabia on Monday on a partial ceasefire in the Ukraine war, a day after delegates from Washington and Kyiv had their own discussions.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump is pushing for a rapid end to the three-year war and hopes talks in Riyadh could pave the way for a breakthrough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides have proposed different plans for temporary ceasefires, but cross-border attacks have meanwhile continued unabated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally planned to take place simultaneously to enable shuttle diplomacy – with the United States going back and forth between the delegations – the talks are now taking place one after the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting between the Ukrainian team, led by defence minister Rustem Umerov, and the Americans finished up late on Sunday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The discussion was productive and focused – we addressed key points including energy," Umerov said on social media, adding Ukraine was working to make its goal of a "just and lasting peace" a reality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump envoy Steve Witkoff voiced optimism that any agreement struck would pave the way for a "full-on" ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think you're going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. And from that you'll naturally gravitate to a full-on shooting ceasefire," he told Fox News.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Kremlin on Sunday downplayed expectations of a rapid resolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are only at the beginning of this path," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there were many outstanding questions over how a potential ceasefire might be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected a joint US-Ukrainian call for a full and immediate 30-day pause, proposing instead a halt in attacks only on energy facilities. (AFP)

 South Korean authorities said on Monday they would deploy dozens of helicopters and thousands of firefighters and soldiers as they struggle to control multiple wildfires in the southeast, which have been burning for days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Four people have been killed so far, with officials warning that high winds and rising temperatures were hindering efforts to put out the blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Uiseong, nearly 7,000 hectares of land has been affected and around 600 people evacuated, said Lim Sang-seop, head of the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A total of 57 wildfire fighting helicopters are to be deployed to extinguish the fire," he said, adding that more than 2,600 fire fighting personnel – including soldiers – would be mobilised "to respond with all their might."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire had been partly contained but was still burning as of Monday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forest agency has issued "severe" fire warnings, its highest level, in multiple locations, including North and South Gyeongsang provinces, Busan and Daejeon.
  <br>
  <br>
  A major wildfire claimed four lives over the weekend in Sancheong county, in South Gyeongsang province, about 250 kilometres southeast of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  That fire was also partly contained by Monday – but still burning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government declared a state of emergency in the affected regions, citing "the extensive damage caused by simultaneous wildfires across the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was reinstated as acting president on Monday, visited the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters, urging authorities to work together "until the wildfires are completely extinguished."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a truly heartbreaking incident," he said, adding that he would meet people affected by the fires later on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, Lee Jae-myung, urged authorities to "mobilise all means at their disposal to quickly and safely suppress the fires" and take further measures to prevent any additional wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some types of extreme weather have a well-established link with climate change, such as heatwaves or heavy rainfall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other phenomena such as forest fires, droughts, snowstorms and tropical storms can result from a combination of complex factors. (AFP)

 China has not received any application for asylum from Philippines' former President Rodrigo Duterte and his family, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's trip to Hong Kong was for his personal holidays, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president was arrested on March 11 at Manila's main airport on his arrival from Hong Kong at the request of the International Criminal Court (ICC) as part of its probe into a "war on drugs" that defined his presidency. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildfires have hit several regions in western Japan, injuring at least two people, forcing dozens of residents to evacuate and damaging a number of homes as hundreds of firefighters battled the widening blazes in the mountainous areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fires in the western towns of Okayama, Imabari and Aso broke out on Sunday, quickly burning hundreds of hectares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six homes have been damaged in city of Okayama, where a fire started on Mount Kaigara and burned 250 hectares of the forest. In Imabari, in the Ehime prefecture on the main island of Shikoku, the fire left a firefighter slightly injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters and defense helicopters sprayed water but the blazes in the two prefectures had not been extinguished as of Monday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts blamed dry weather and dried-up fallen leaves on the ground in the forest as likely causes of the wildfires in Okayama and Imabari.
  <br>
  <br>
  A smaller fire was detected in the mountainous village of Aso in the Kumamoto prefecture on the southern main island of Kyushu on Sunday, but it was extinguished early on Monday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. One person was injured slightly. Local media said the fire started while residents were burning trash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires came just weeks after extensive wildfires in the northern Japanese city of Ofunato left one person dead and damaged more than 200 houses and other buildings as the blaze burned 2,900 hectares, nearly one tenth of the land in the city. (AP)
