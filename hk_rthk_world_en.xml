<div class="itemFullText">
 A 26-year-old man was arrested Monday over the targeted killing of a health insurance executive on the streets of New York, with investigators charging him with possession of fake IDs and a gun.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investigators continued to interrogate Luigi Mangione in connection with last week's brazen murder, which triggered a nationwide manhunt and global headlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  He arrived at a Pennsylvania court wearing a dark sweatshirt on Monday evening and was led inside by Altoona police flanked by NYPD detectives where he was arraigned, broadcasters showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione is next due to appear in court on December 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said that murder charges in New York state would follow, telling a media briefing "we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have not confirmed reports the words "delay" and "deny" – language used by insurers to reject claims – were written on casings found at the scene, hinting at a possible political motive for the crime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione was apprehended by officers following a tip from staff at an Altoona McDonald's branch, where he was found wearing a mask and a beanie while using a laptop, and gave officers a fake ID, charging documents show.
  <br>
  <br>
  They then searched him and found what police called a "ghost gun" capable of firing 9MM rounds and equipped with a suppressor that could have been made on a 3D printer.
  <br>
  <br>
  When officers asked if he had been to New York recently, Mangione "became quiet and started to shake," according to the criminal complaint.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the fake IDs found was that used to check in to a Manhattan hostel ahead of the attack, discovered alongside a document that spoke to Mangione's "motivation and mindset", New York police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, studied at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania, and had been living in Hawaii ahead of the killing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He matches the description of the identification we've been looking for. He's also in possession of several items that we believe will connect him to this incident," said New York mayor Eric Adams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police told reporters that Mangione possessed material that suggested he had "ill-will towards corporate America". (AFP)

    2024 the hottest year on record: EU monitor

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 This year will be the world's warmest since records began, with extraordinarily high temperatures expected to persist into at least the first few months of 2025, European Union scientists said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) comes two weeks after UN climate talks yielded a US$300 billion deal to tackle climate change, a package that poorer countries blasted as insufficient to cover the soaring cost of climate-related disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  C3S said data from January to November had confirmed 2024 is now certain to be the hottest year on record, and the first in which average global temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous hottest year on record was 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Extreme weather has swept around the world in 2024, with severe drought hitting Italy and South America, fatal floods in Nepal, Sudan and Europe, heatwaves in Mexico, Mali and Saudi Arabia that killed thousands, and disastrous cyclones in the US and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientific studies have confirmed the fingerprints of human-caused climate change on all of these disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month ranked as the second-warmest November on record after November 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still in near-record high territory for global temperatures, and that's likely to stay at least for the next few months," Copernicus climate researcher Julien Nicolas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cutting emissions to net zero – as many governments have pledged to eventually do – will stop global warming from getting worse. Yet despite these green pledges, global CO2 emissions are set to hit a record high this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  C3S' records go back to 1940, and are cross-checked with global temperature records going back to 1850. (Reuters)

    Transition talks under way in post-Assad Syria

<img alt="People queue to buy bread in Damascus, now under the control of rebels who toppled the Assad regime. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782769_1_20241209221346.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Damascus stirred back to life on Monday at the start of a hopeful but uncertain era after rebels seized the capital and President Bashar al-Assad fled, following 13 years of civil war and more than 50 years of his family's rule.
 <br>
  <br>
  Heavy traffic returned to the streets and people ventured out after a nighttime curfew, but most shops remained shut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebels milled about in the centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main rebel commander Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, met overnight with Assad's Prime Minister Mohammed Jalali and Vice President Faisal Mekdad to discuss arrangements for a transitional government, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Jazeera television reported that the transitional authority would be headed by Mohamed Al-Bashir, who ran the administration in a small pocket of rebel-held territory before the 12-day lightning offensive that swept into Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's banks would reopen on Tuesday and staff had been asked to return to offices, according to a Syrian central bank source and two commercial bankers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's currency would continue to be used, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighters from the remote countryside milled about in the capital, clustering in the central Umayyad Square before Damascus's great eight-century mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a purpose and a goal and now we are done with it. We want the state and security forces to be in charge," said Firdous Omar, who said he had been battling the Assad government since 2011 and was now looking forward to laying down his weapon and returning to his job as a farmer in provincial Idlib.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advance of a militia alliance spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al Qaeda affiliate, was a generational turning point for the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ends a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble, swathes of countryside depopulated and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions. Millions of refugees could finally go home from camps across Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's fall wipes out one of the main bastions from which Iran and Russia wielded power across the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkey, long aligned with Assad's foes, emerges strengthened, while Israel hailed it as an outcome of its blows to Assad's Iran-backed allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arab world faces the challenge of reintegrating one of the Middle East's central states, while containing the militant Sunni Islam that underpinned the anti-Assad revolt but has also metastasised into the horrific sectarian violence of Islamic State.
  <br>
  <br>
  HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations, but has spent years trying to soften its image to reassure foreign states and minority groups within Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's leader Golani, who spent years in US custody as an insurgent in Iraq but broke with al Qaeda and Islamic State to align his movement with more mainstream anti-Assad groups, has vowed to rebuild Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new history, my brothers, is being written in the entire region after this great victory," he told a huge crowd at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus on Sunday. With hard work Syria would be "a beacon for the Islamic nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's prime minister Jalali told Sky New Arabia he was ready to provide documents and assistance for the transfer of power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fate of Syria's army would be "left to the brothers who will take over the management of the country's affairs", Jalali said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What concerns us today is the continuation of services for Syrians." (Reuters)

    SKorean justice ministry imposes travel ban on Yoon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s Justice Ministry on Monday imposed an overseas travel ban on President Yoon Suk-yeol as authorities investigate allegations of rebellion and other charges in connection with his short-lived declaration of martial law last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s martial law decree last Tuesday, which brought special forces troops into Seoul streets, plunged South Korea into political turmoil and caused worry among its key diplomatic partners and neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Yoon avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him, with most governing party lawmakers boycotting a parliamentary vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the opposition parties vowed to submit a new impeachment motion against him this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bae Sang-up, a Justice Ministry official, told a parliamentary hearing that it banned Yoon from leaving the country following requests by police, prosecutors and an anti-corruption agency as they expand their probes into the circumstances surrounding Yoon’s power grab.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a senior National Police Agency officer told local reporters in a background briefing that police can also detain Yoon if conditions are met.
  <br>
  <br>
  While a sitting South Korean president has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.
  <br>
  <br>
  This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by police over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that police will forcefully detain him or search his office because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. (AP)

    Australia launches special task force on antisemitism

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia on Monday launched an anti-semitism task force following an arson attack at a synagogue in Melbourne last week which police say was likely terrorism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire early on Friday at the Adass Israel synagogue injured one and caused widespread damage, and has strained relations between Australia and its ally Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the third anti-semitic attack in Australia this year, following the vandalism of a Jewish MP's office in Melbourne in June and anti-semitic graffiti daubed on cars in Sydney's eastern suburbs, an area with a high Jewish population, last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australian Federal Police (AFP) task force will be known as Abalight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special Operation Abalight will be an agile and experienced squad of counter-terrorism investigators who will focus on threats, violence, and hatred towards the Australian Jewish community and parliamentarians," the head of the AFP Reece Kershaw told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In essence, they will be a flying squad to deploy nationally to incidents."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the attacks on the Jewish community were concerning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Antisemitism is a major threat, and antisemitism has been on the rise," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Monday, Australian police transferred the investigation into Friday's blaze to a joint counter-terrorism unit, saying the blaze was likely a terrorist attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  State and federal police along with the country's domestic intelligence service will work in tandem to identify three suspects wanted in connection with the attack, Shane Patton, Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have the best resources, best-skilled investigators, people who are expert in this field, and we will throw everything we can at this investigation to resolve it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police initially said on Friday it did not believe the fire met the threshold of a terror attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Designating it a suspected terror incident gives investigators additional resources and powers that include preventative detention, Patton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have also stepped up patrols of Jewish areas in Melbourne in order to reassure the community there, he added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's former president Bashar al-Assad is in Moscow with his family after Russia granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds, a Kremlin source told Russian news agencies on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Foreign Ministry said that Assad had left Syria and had given orders for a peaceful transfer of power, after rebel fighters raced into Damascus unopposed on Sunday, ending nearly six decades of his family's rule and a brutal 13-year civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syrian President Assad of Syria and members of his family have arrived in Moscow. Russia has granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds," state media quoted the unnamed Kremlin source as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Syrians awakened on Monday to a hopeful if uncertain future, after rebels seized the capital Damascus, forcing Assad to flee the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lightning advance of a militia alliance spearheaded by Hayat al-Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaeda affiliate, marked one of the biggest turning points for the Middle East in generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's fall wiped out a bastion from which Iran and Russia exercised influence across the Arab world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in the international community sought to take stock of a new-look Middle East following the end of Assad's autocratic rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden said Syria is in a period of risk and uncertainty, and it is the first time in years that neither Russia, Iran nor Hezbollah held an influential role there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebels face a monumental task of rebuilding and running a country after a war that left hundreds of thousands dead, cities pounded to dust and an economy hollowed by global sanctions. Syria will need billions of dollars in aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new history, my brothers, is being written in the entire region after this great victory," said Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the head of HTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to a huge crowd on Sunday at Damascus' Umayyad Mosque, a place of enormous religious significance, Golani said with hard work Syria would be "a beacon for the Islamic nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the US, Turkey and the United Nations, although it has spent years trying to soften its image to reassure international governments and minority groups within Syria. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An architect in Hong Kong says laser scanning of Paris' famous Notre Dame Cathedral, carried out by late art historian Andrew Tallon, played a crucial role in the restoration of the Gothic gem.
 <br>
  <br>
  The more than 850-year-old cathedral has finally reopened its doors after it was partially destroyed by a fire in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the timber roof and the structure's spire were ravaged by the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu Ka-sing, Associate Professor of Practice at the Faculty of Architecture from the University of Hong Kong told RTHK that Tallon's scans of the interior and exterior of the cathedral conducted before the blaze provided basic information for the restoration team to start with.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically, it is the process that can allow the site to create a digital twin of the historic building by collecting a range of geospatial information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu noted that the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum in China cooperated with France on the restoration, and its deputy director Zhou Ping paid a visit to France earlier this year to gain a better understanding of the restoration process.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the international heritage conservation aspect, both France and China are of the highest levels," said Yu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also given the fact that the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum [Site Museum] has also got many burned timber debris, so sharing some similarity with Notre Dame, the two sites have some good knowledge for exchange."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite rolling out the red carpet to the public, the 700-million euro restoration project has yet to be completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tasks, such as the restoration of the chevet and sacristy, as well as the installation of stained glass windows will continue.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's main opposition party said on Sunday it would try again to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol after his declaration of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, police arrested the defence minister in charge of the martial law operation, and the interior minister resigned. Both they and Yoon are being investigated for alleged insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon averted impeachment late on Saturday as huge crowds braved freezing temperatures in another night of protests outside parliament to demand the president's ouster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties proposed the impeachment motion, which needed 200 votes in the 300-member parliament to pass, but a near-total boycott by Yoon's People Power Party doomed it to failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jae-myung, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, said on Sunday that they will try again on December 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yoon, the principal culprit behind the insurrection and military coup that destroyed South Korea's constitutional order, must either resign immediately or be impeached without delay," Lee told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On December 14, our Democratic Party will impeach Yoon in the name of the people." (AFP)

 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said on Sunday it hoped Syria would return "to stability as soon as possible", after rebels said they had taken Damascus and sent President Bashar al-Assad fleeing.

  Beijing "is closely following the development of the situation in Syria and hopes that Syria returns to stability as soon as possible", a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.

  "The Chinese government has actively assisted Chinese citizens who are willing to leave Syria in a safe and orderly way, and has maintained contact with... Chinese citizens who remain in Syria," the ministry said.

    Notre Dame holds its first Sunday mass since fire

<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly restored Notre Dame cathedral held its first service for the public on Sunday after a historic re-opening ceremony that saw firefighters, builders and artists celebrated for their work saving the 12th-century masterpiece.
 <br>
  <br>
  The beloved Paris monument nearly burned down in 2019, but has been renovated inside and fitted with a new roof and spire during a frenzied reconstruction effort since then.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a re-opening service on Saturday, attended by world leaders including incoming US president Donald Trump, French leader Emmanuel Macron expressed the "gratitude of the French nation" for the work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have rediscovered what great nations can do -- achieve the impossible," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the most moving moments came when firefighters in their protective gear walked through the congregation to thunderous applause as the word "Merci" ("Thank you") was beamed on the intricate facade and famous belltowers of the Gothic masterpiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  The architectural wonder had been in danger of collapsing during the April 2019 blaze and was saved only by the heroic intervention of teams of firefighters pumping water from the nearby River Seine.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the morning service, a second mass in the evening at 6.30pm will be open to the public, with roughly 2,500 people who secured free tickets this week expected to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cathedral will open fully to visitors on December 16 via an online reservation system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact cause of the 2019 blaze has never been identified despite a forensic investigation by prosecutors, who believe an accident such as an electrical fault was the most likely reason.
  <br>
  <br>
  Notre Dame welcomed around 12 million visitors a year before the fire, but expects to receive an even higher figure of "14 to 15 million" after the reopening, according to the church authorities. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday that Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky was keen for a deal to end his country's conflict with Russia, after the pair met in Paris to celebrate the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral.
 <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron hosted three-way talks with Zelensky and Trump at the Elysee Palace on Saturday, almost three years into the war and ahead of the US president-elect taking office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Zelenskyy and Ukraine would like to make a deal and stop the madness," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's meeting with Trump was his first face-to-face encounter with the tycoon-turned-politician since his November election victory. (AFP)

    Syrian rebels say they have toppled Assad

<div class="itemFullText">
 Syrian rebels announced on state television they had ousted President Bashar al-Assad, eliminating a 50-year family dynasty in a lightning offensive that raises the spectre of a new wave of instability in a Middle East gripped by war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Syria's army command notified officers on Sunday that Assad's regime had ended, a Syrian officer who was informed of the move told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Syrian army later said it was continuing operations against "terrorist groups" in the key cities of Hama and Homs and in Deraa countryside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad, who had crushed all forms of dissent, flew out of Damascus for an unknown destination earlier on Sunday, two senior army officers told international media, as rebels said they had entered the capital with no sign of army deployments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We celebrate with the Syrian people the news of freeing our prisoners and releasing their chains and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Sednaya prison," the rebels said, referring to a large military prison on the outskirts of Damascus where the Syrian government detained thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said the government was ready to “extend its hand” to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am in my house and I have not left, and this is because of my belonging to this country,” Jalili said in a video statement. He said he would go to his office to continue work in the morning and called on Syrian citizens not to deface public property.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not address reports that Assad had left the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed to reporters that Assad took a flight from Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  State television in Iran, Assad’s main backer in the years of war in Syria, reported that Assad had left the capital. It cited Qatar’s Al Jazeera news network for the information and did not elaborate.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate statement from the Syrian government on the reports of Assad's departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the leader of Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, ordered forces on Sunday not to approach official institutions in Damascus, saying they would remain under the prime minister until they are "officially" handed over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To all military forces in the city of Damascus, it is strictly forbidden to approach public institutions, which will remain under the supervision of the former prime minister until they are officially handed over," Jolani said in a statement on Telegram, using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa instead of his nom de guerre, and adding: "It is forbidden to shoot into the air."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol will not be involved in foreign and other state affairs before his early departure, the leader of Yoon's ruling party said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  People Power Party leader Han Dong-hoon made the comments during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, after Yoon survived an impeachment vote in the opposition-led parliament late on Saturday over his brief imposition of martial law last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's future remained uncertain on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A boycott by Yoon's party killed off the impeachment motion late on Saturday even as huge crowds braved freezing temperatures outside parliament to demand his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the deeply unpopular president's survival may be short-lived, with Yoon's People Power Party saying it had "effectively obtained (Yoon's) promise to step down".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until the president steps down, the president will be effectively excluded from his duties," it said in a statement. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syrian rebels said they have seized control of the capital Damascus with reports suggesting that President Bashar al-Assad had boarded a plane and left the country for an unknown destination on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands in cars and on foot congregated at a main square in Damascus waving and chanting "Freedom", witnesses said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We celebrate with the Syrian people the news of freeing our prisoners and releasing their chains and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Sednaya prison," said the rebels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sednaya is a large military prison on the outskirts Damascus where the Syrian government detained thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just hours earlier, rebels announced they had gained full control of the key city of Homs after only a day of fighting, leaving Assad's 24-year rule dangling by a thread.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intense sounds of shooting were heard in the centre of the Damascus, residents said on Sunday, although it was not immediately clear what the source of the shooting was.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rural areas southwest of the capital, local youths and former rebels took advantage of the loss of authority to come to the streets in acts of defiance against Assad's rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Homs residents poured onto the streets after the army withdrew from the central city, dancing and chanting "Assad is gone, Homs is free" and "Long live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebels fired into the air in celebration, and youths tore down posters of the Syrian president, whose territorial control has collapsed in a dizzying week-long retreat by the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fall of Homs gives the insurgents control over Syria's strategic heartland and a key highway crossroads, severing Damascus from the coastal region that is the stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect and where his Russian allies have a naval base and air base.
  <br>
  <br>
  Homs' capture is also a powerful symbol of the rebel movement's dramatic comeback in the 13-year-old conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swathes of Homs were destroyed by gruelling siege warfare between the rebels and the army years ago. The fighting ground down the insurgents, who were forced out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the main rebel leader, called the capture of Homs a historic moment and urged fighters not to harm "those who drop their arms".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebels freed thousands of detainees from the city prison. Security forces left in haste after burning their documents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents of numerous Damascus districts turned out to protest Assad on Saturday evening, and security forces were either unwilling or unable to clamp down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrian rebel commander Hassan Abdul Ghani said in a statement early on Sunday that operations were ongoing to "completely liberate" the countryside around Damascus and rebel forces were looking toward the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Syrian army said it was reinforcing around Damascus, and state television reported on Saturday that Assad remained in the city. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's former defence minister was arrested on Sunday, local media reported, a day after President Yoon Suk Yeol survived an impeachment vote over his calamitous attempt to impose martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  The motion failed due to a boycott of the vote by Yoon's party, even though huge crowds braved freezing temperatures in another night of protests outside parliament in Seoul to demand the president's ouster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Yong-hyun had already resigned as defence minister after the brief suspension of civilian rule late on Tuesday by Yoon that saw soldiers and helicopters sent to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was forced to rescind the order hours later and parliament voted down his decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim had already been slapped with a travel ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have launched an investigation into Yoon, Kim and others for alleged insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutors' office was not immediately available for comment on Kim's arrest, reported by the Yonhap news agency and other local media outlets on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties proposed the impeachment motion, which needed 200 votes in the 300-member parliament to pass, but a near-total boycott by Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) doomed it to failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PPP said after the vote that it had blocked the impeachment to avoid "severe division and chaos", adding that it would "resolve this crisis in a more orderly and responsible manner".
  <br>
  <br>
  Party leader Han Dong-hoon said that the party had "effectively obtained" Yoon's promise to step down, and said until this happened he would "be effectively excluded from his duties", leaving the prime minister and party to manage state affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The failure of the impeachment motion came as a huge blow to the massive crowds -- numbering 150,000 according to police, one million according to organisers -- demonstrating outside parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik called the PPP's walkout "a failure to engage in the democratic process" on the part of the ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though we didn't get the outcome we wanted today, I am neither discouraged nor disappointed because we will get it eventually," protester Jo Ah-gyeong, 30, said on Saturday.

    Notre Dame re-opens five years after fire

 The archbishop of Paris re-opened Notre Dame cathedral on Saturday by symbolically knocking on the doors and entering the 12th-century landmark which has been restored after a devastating fire in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wearing new designer vestments and carrying a staff cut from one of the roof beams that survived the inferno, Laurent Ulrich joined hundreds of VIPs inside the Gothic masterpiece for a two-hour ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ulrich commanded the cathedral to "open your doors" and he entered the magnificently-restored edifice.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump sat on the front row as guest of honour next to French President Emmanuel Macron, with invitees marvelling at the freshly cleaned walls, new furniture and state-of-the-art lightening installed as part of the cathedral's overhaul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other dignitaries in attendance included outgoing US first lady Jill Biden and Prince William.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside, small crowds of Parisians and tourists braved wet weather and high winds to witness the renaissance of a beloved monument which came close to being totally destroyed by the inferno that toppled its roof and spire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reconstruction effort has cost around US$750 million, financed from donations, with the re-opening achieved within a five-year deadline set by Macron despite predictions it could take decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Workers had to overcome problems with lead pollution, the Covid-19 epidemic, and the army general overseeing the project falling to his death while hiking in the Pyrenees last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is "a cathedral like we have never seen before," Philippe Jost, who took over as project manager last year, told Franceinfo radio, adding that he was proud to "show the whole world" a "great collective success and a source of pride for all of France".
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's service featured prayer, organ music and hymns from the cathedral's choir.
  <br>
  <br>
  A public concert planned in front of the cathedral featuring Chinese piano virtuoso Lang Lang and possibly US singer and fashion designer Pharrell Williams had to be pre-recorded on Friday night because of the stormy weather. (AFP)

 US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday said that the world was "a little crazy" as he met President Emmanuel Macron in Paris ahead of the re-opening of Notre Dame cathedral on his first international trip since his re-election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two men embraced and shook hands several times on the steps of the French presidential palace, with Trump given a full guard of honour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems like the world is going a little crazy right now and we will be talking about that," Trump told reporters as he prepared to sit down for talks with Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite tensions between the two men during his first term, Trump hailed his ties with the centrist French leader, saying, "We had a great relationship as everyone knows. We accomplished a lot."
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron told Trump it was "a great honour for French people to welcome you" for the re-opening ceremony at Notre Dame, which was devastated by a blaze in 2019 during Trump's first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You were president at that time and I remember the solidarity and the immediate reaction," Macron added, speaking in English.
  <br>
  <br>
  When he first took office in 2017, Trump's ties with Macron, then also a fresh face on the world stage, began warmly despite some political differences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the Elysee Palace soon after and the trio posed for pictures before commencing talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  They held trilateral talks on topics including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as trade. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An opposition-led motion to impeach South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol over his brief declaration of martial law failed on Saturday as it did not meet the required quorum after his party boycotted the vote.
 <br>
  <br>
  "With a total of 195 votes, the number of members who voted did not reach the required two-thirds majority of the total members. Therefore, I declare that the vote on this matter is not valid," National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties, which hold 192 seats in the 300-seat parliament, earlier filed the impeachment motion, which needed 200 votes to pass and went to the vote on Saturday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  But almost all 108 members of Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) filed out of the chamber before the vote, prompting critical shouts from the opposition -- with one yelling "Where are you going?" and others calling them "accomplices to insurrection".
  <br>
  <br>
  Only three PPP members cast ballots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, nearly 150,000 people were estimated by police to have filled the streets around the National Assembly, demanding that lawmakers impeach Yoon for his sudden imposition of martial law four days earlier, which plunged South Korea into turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  For hours, people poured into the area around parliament where on Tuesday night soldiers were helicoptered in as part of Yoon's short-lived bid to subvert civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the vote, Yoon, 63, apologised for the turmoil but said he would leave it to his party to decide his fate. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Many of the tens of thousands of protesters outside South Korea's parliament were overcome with emotion on Saturday, as a presidential impeachment motion against President Yoon Suk Yeol looked set to fail.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the plenary session got under way in South Korea’s national assembly, some members of the ruling People Power Party (PPP) walked out of the chamber after voting on the special counsel appointment in the first lady’s case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours later, some ruling PPP lawmakers returned to cast their votes, telling reporters they voted against the impeachment and that they returned to vote because it was "important".
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 150,000 people were estimated by police to have filled the streets around the National Assembly on Saturday, demanding that lawmakers impeach Yoon for his sudden imposition of martial law four days earlier, which plunged South Korea into turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  For hours, people poured into the area around parliament where on Tuesday night soldiers were helicoptered in as part of Yoon's short-lived bid to subvert civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the vote on the opposition-led impeachment motion, giant screens to show parliament livefeeds were set up across the eight-lane road by the National Assembly, which had been closed off to serve as a rally site.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the event that the impeachment vote is passed, Yoon would be immediately suspended and replaced as president by the prime minister, Han Duck-soo. It would then be left to the Constitutional court to decide whether to uphold the national assembly’s vote. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of people across the UK were left without power on Saturday morning after Storm Darragh hit the country with strong winds and caused pre-Christmas travel disruption.
 <br>
  <br>
  The UK's Met Office had issued a rare red alert for high winds overnight to Saturday morning (0300 to 1100 GMT) covering parts of Wales and southwest England.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government warned three million people living in the area with a siren-like alert on their phones to stay at home on Friday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the storm posed a "challenging situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  "About three million homes will have had the emergency alert system on their mobile phone. I would just encourage anyone who has had that to follow the advice," Reynolds told Sky News on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darragh, the fourth named storm of the season, is also expected to bring heavy rain through the weekend, with more than 100 flood warnings and alerts in place across the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Wales, the Met Office estimated gusts of up to 150 kmh, which knocked out power for over 50,000 people, according to the PA news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Power cuts affected 86,000 homes in England, Scotland and Wales, according to the Energy Networks Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  Network Rail Wales suspended trains on the Welsh northern coast due to a "fallen tree blocking the line," and several bridges in southern England and Wales were closed for safety reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate amber warning, which is less serious than the red alert but still poses a "potential risk to life and property," covering a larger stretch of the UK and Northern Ireland is in place until Saturday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Northern Ireland, thousands were left without power, and several bus and train services were suspended or delayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christmas markets and sporting events were postponed, including the Merseyside derby between Premier League leaders Liverpool and Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Ireland, which issued an "orange" wind warning, 400,000 people were left without electricity, according to the RTE news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dublin Airport said "A number of flights scheduled for Saturday morning have been cancelled by airlines" due to the storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darragh comes two weeks after Storm Bert battered much of Britain, causing "devastating" flooding in parts of Wales and knocking out power to thousands of homes in Ireland. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A three-storey apartment block in The Hague partially collapsed on Saturday after a fire and explosion, firefighters said, with first responders searching for people under the rubble.
 <br>
  <br>
  Auhtorities said at least three people have died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several people have already been pulled out of the debris and taken to hospital, as elite teams with sniffer dogs deployed to rescue others trapped by the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not known how many people were still missing nor what caused the explosion in the block of flats not far from the centre of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still don't know how many people might be under the rubble," said a police officer on-site.
  <br>
  <br>
  A witness at the scene saw dozens of fire trucks as firefighters battled the blaze from the ground and from higher positions. Police helicopters circled overhead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Debris was strewn across the street and several windows had been blown out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huge plumes of smoke were billowing from a large hole where the building stood, with an acrid smell in the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was asleep and suddenly there was this huge bang," Adam Muller, said one 14-year-old local resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I looked out of the window and just saw flames. It's a massive shock," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities warned locals to keep their windows shut and shut off ventilation systems due to the smoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forensic investigators arrived on the scene to begin to probe a potential cause for the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several homes appeared to have been destroyed by the fire, which broke out around 6:15 am (0515 GMT), according to the emergency services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three floors of the building consisted of shops on the ground floors and five two-storey apartments, authorities said, with living rooms on the second floor and bedrooms on the top. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol stopped short of resigning on Saturday over his declaration of martial law, with a vote to impeach him hours away and mass street protests planned in Seoul.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon stunned the nation and the international community on Tuesday night by imposing martial law for the first time since the 1980s and deploying troops and helicopters to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  But lawmakers managed to vote down the decree, forcing Yoon to rescind the order in the early hours of Wednesday in a night of extraordinary drama for a country assumed to be a stable democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The declaration of martial law arose from my urgency as the president," he said in a televised address, the first time he has appeared before the public since plunging the country into political chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, in the process, I caused anxiety and inconvenience to the public. I sincerely apologize to the citizens who were greatly distressed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition and even key members of his own party have called for him to step down, and parliament is set to vote later Saturday on his impeachment, although the opposition leader has said it's not clear if the motion can pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have said they expect tens of thousands of anti-Yoon protestors to take to the streets ahead of the vote, with organisers hoping 200,000 people will attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon did not offer to resign in his brief address, saying only that he would "entrust the party with measures to stabilise the political situation, including my term in office."
  <br>
  <br>
  His party is divided on the issue, with lawmakers on Friday sticking to the official line that they would block impeachment, even after party head Han Dong-hoon said Yoon must go or Seoul risked more political chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The normal performance of the president's duties is impossible under the (current) circumstances, and an early resignation of the president is inevitable," Han Dong-hoon told reporters early on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition bloc holds 192 seats in the 300-strong parliament, while Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) has 108.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just eight ruling party lawmakers need to defect for the vote to get the two-thirds majority it needs to pass. One PPP lawmaker has already publicly said they will vote with the opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  A successful vote would suspend Yoon from office pending a ruling by the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have begun investigating Yoon and others for alleged insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will not shy away from the issue of legal and political responsibility regarding the declaration of martial law," Yoon said during his address.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday night, at least 15,000 anti-Yoon protesters braved the cold weather to gather in Seoul's Yeouido district, where the National Assembly is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some camped out all night despite freezing temperatures while opposition MPs remained in parliament, fearing Yoon might try some desperate measure to remain in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  An opinion poll released Friday put backing for the 63-year-old president at a record low of 13 percent. (AFP)

<img alt="Mary Jane Veloso had been set to face the firing squad in 2015. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782442_1_20241206205203.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Filipina on death row in Indonesia could be home before Christmas after Manila and Jakarta signed an agreement to repatriate her, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mother of two Mary Jane Veloso was arrested in 2010 after the suitcase she was carrying was found to be lined with 2.6 kilogrammes of heroin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her supporters claim she was duped by an international drug syndicate, and in 2015, she narrowly escaped execution after her suspected recruiter was arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agree to return the person concerned to the Philippines," Indonesia's senior law and human rights minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra told reporters after signing a "practical arrangement" for Veloso's repatriation in Jakarta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mary Jane Veloso becomes the responsibility of the Philippines," he said, adding that he had heard that the death penalty would be changed to life imprisonment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yusril said the transfer could be carried out "before Christmas."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe around December 20 it can be realised."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso's mother said she was "elated and surprised" to hear of her daughter's homecoming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can finally be together this Christmas," Celia Veloso, 65, said. "This might be the happiest Christmas we will ever have as a family."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso's case sparked uproar in the Philippines, with rallies of support and world boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao pleading for her life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her supporters said she was headed to work as a maid when she was arrested in Indonesia.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was due to face the firing squad in 2015 but the Philippine government won a last-minute reprieve for her after a woman suspected of recruiting her was arrested and put on trial for human trafficking and Veloso was named as a prosecution witness.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines' Department of Justice Undersecretary Raul Vasquez expressed "heartfelt gratitude" over Veloso's repatriation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are hopeful that we will be able to do this before Christmas so that it will be a happier Christmas for everyone," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Velosos have "long been wanting to see their family back and hold her in their arms."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vasquez said Veloso would serve her sentence "as agreed upon, in accordance with Philippine laws."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do understand and we respect the decision of the Indonesian courts with respect to the sentence that was meted out to our citizen Mary Jane Veloso," he said. (AFP)

 Air strikes targeted a bridge on the highway linking the Syrian cities of Homs and Hama, a war monitor said on Friday, as government forces scramble to secure Homs after Islamist-led rebels captured Hama and commercial hub Aleppo.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Fighter jets executed several airstrikes, targeting Al-Rastan bridge on (the) Homs-Hama highway... as well as attacking positions around the bridge, attempting to cut off the road between Hama and Homs and secure Homs," the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebels led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched their offensive a little more than a week ago, just as a ceasefire in neighbouring Lebanon took hold between Israel and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's ally Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  To slow the rebel advance, the Observatory said Assad's forces erected soil barriers on the highway north of Homs, Syria's third-largest city which lies just 40 kilometres south of Hama.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tens of thousands of members of Assad's Alawite minority community were fleeing Homs on Thursday, for fear that the rebels would keep up their advance, the Observatory said earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebels captured Hama on Thursday following street battles with government forces, announcing "the complete liberation of the city" in a message on their Telegram channel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebel fighters kissed the ground and let off volleys of celebratory gunfire as they entered Syria's fourth-largest city. (AFP)

<img alt="Lieutenant General Chun In-bum says the South Korean army were not aware why martial law was being declared on Tuesday evening. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782382_1_20241206144213.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean retired military official said on Friday that the resignation of the country's defence minister, Kim Yong-hyun, implies that the ministry is taking full responsibility for the short-lived imposition of martial law earlier this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law on Tuesday evening, before agreeing to lift it just several hours later after the National Assembly voted against the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK, Lieutenant General Chun In-bum, who retired in 2016, said the army did not have advance knowledge of Yoon's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The army were not aware why martial law was being declared and what their mission was in detail. They were told just a couple of hours before their mission was to occupy certain government buildings to include the National Assembly. Many of them even did not know where they were going until they arrived there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chun added that the army's reputation is unharmed, but morale has been affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reputation of the army is intact because the soldiers involved knew that something was wrong and did not pursue the given mission very proactively, thereby allowing the democratic system to work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that the Korean people understand that the army had nothing to do with it. They were under orders from their commander-in-chief, who was the president of Korea. They probably thought that he was giving them a bona fide task."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chun said the country has to come up with arrangements to maintain law and order and avoid similar events from happening again.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that South Korea requires martial law to be an available option, so as to counter threats from North Korea.

    South Korean ruling party demands Yoon step down

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's ruling party chief demanded on Friday that President Yoon Suk Yeol stand down over his martial law attempt, warning he posed a great danger to the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han Dong-hoon said in televised remarks that credible evidence suggests that Yoon ordered the arrest of key politicians on the night he declared martial law this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was confirmed last night (Thursday) through credible evidence that on the day martial law was declared, President Yoon Suk Yeol instructed the chief of the Counterintelligence Command, his junior from university, to arrest key politicians, [labelling] them as anti-state forces, and mobilised intelligence agencies to arrest them," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stunning comments from the head of Yoon's People Power Party (PPP), almost guarantees enough lawmakers will vote to impeach the president on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han's comments were also a U-turn from Thursday, when he said he would block the impeachment, and another party leader insisted all 108 members of the PPP would unite to support Yoon in Saturday's vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Han said on Friday that Yoon's refusal to acknowledge he had done anything wrong in declaring martial law on Tuesday night had prompted his change of position.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Considering the newly emerging facts, I believe that a swift suspension of President Yoon Suk Yeol's duties is necessary to safeguard the Republic of Korea and its people," Han said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said Yoon had not taken any personnel actions against military officials who had "illegally intervened". "Furthermore, he does not acknowledge that this illegal martial law is wrong," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, if President Yoon continues to hold the office of the presidency, there is a significant risk that extreme actions similar to the current state of emergency could be repeated, which could put the Republic of Korea and its citizens in great danger."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suspended civilian rule late Tuesday and deployed troops and helicopters to parliament only for lawmakers to vote down the measure and force him into a U-turn in a night of protests and drama.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's allies were alarmed and the opposition quickly filed an impeachment motion, saying Yoon "gravely violated the constitution and the law". A vote is set for Saturday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition holds a large majority in the 300-member legislature and requires only a handful of defections from the PPP to secure the two-thirds majority needed for impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the impeachment motion passes, Yoon will be suspended pending a verdict by the Constitutional Court. If the judges give the nod, Yoon will be impeached and new elections must take place within 60 days. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian authorities have arrested a Chinese man sought by Beijing for allegedly helping transfer and laundering almost US$18 million from a criminal online gambling group in China, officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yan Zhenxing was detained on Monday by immigration officers at a cross-border ferry terminal on Batam island, next to Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuldi Yusman, the Director of Immigration Supervision and Enforcement, said Yan was arrested following an Interpol red notice for him. The notices request law enforcement agencies worldwide to detain or arrest a suspect wanted by a specific country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yusman said Yan, a Chinese national and permanent resident of Singapore, was arriving in Batam for holiday with his family when he was detained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesian authorities brought the suspect, wearing a detainee’s orange shirt and a facemask, to a news conference on Thursday in the capital of Jakarta. The suspect did not make any statements and was not asked any questions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yusman said that Yan was named as a suspect by police in China’s Inner Mongolia region who allege he was involved in transferring and laundering more than 130 million yuan (US$17.8 million) from a criminal online gambling group.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Yan was handed to Indonesia's National Central Bureau Interpol in Jakarta on Thursday and a decision to deport or to extradite him to China will take some time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrest came just two months after immigration officers on the tourist island of Bali arrested a Chinese suspect sought by Beijing who allegedly helped to run investment scams that brought in over US$14 billion from clients in China. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police have begun investigating President Yoon Suk-yeol for alleged "insurrection" over his declaration of martial law, a senior police officer said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Woo Jong-soo, head of the National Investigation Headquarters of the National Police Agency, told lawmakers that "the case has been assigned," footage showed
  <br>
  <br>
  President Yoon's office said there would be no public statements on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Yoon will not make any statements today," a presidential official told reporters, as the opposition set an impeachment vote for 7pm on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Yoon accepted the resignation of his defense minister as opposition parties moved to impeach both men over the stunning yet short-lived imposition of martial law that brought armed troops into Seoul streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted a joint motion to impeach President Yoon on Wednesday over his martial law declaration the previous night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martial law lasted about six hours, as the National Assembly quickly voted to overrule the president, forcing his Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Yoon’s office said he replaced Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun with Choi Byung-hyuk, a retired four-star general who is South Korea’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Defence Minister Kim Seon-ho will be the acting minister until Choi assumes the job after a parliamentary hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing is seen as a formality as the president holds the power to appoint ministers outside of the prime minister without the approval of lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon hasn’t made any public appearances since he announced in a televised address that his government was lifting the martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition parties earlier submitted a separate motion to impeach Kim, alleging he recommended Yoon impose martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Kim offered to resign and apologised for causing disruption and concern to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim said “all troops who performed duties related to martial law were acting on my instructions, and all responsibility lies with me,” according to the Defence Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The impeachment motion on Yoon was introduced at a parliamentary plenary session early Thursday, meaning it can be put to a vote between Friday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, the motion will be scrapped if it isn’t voted within 72 hours of its parliamentary introduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties can submit a new impeachment motion if the current one is scrapped or voted down, according to National Assembly officials. (Agencies)

 Police in New York City have launched a manhunt for a gunman who killed UnitedHealthcare’s CEO on Wednesday outside a Manhattan hotel where the health insurer was holding its investor conference.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brian Thompson, 50, was shot around 6.45am as he walked alone to the New York Hilton Midtown from a nearby hotel, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooter appeared to be “lying in wait for several minutes” before approaching Thompson from behind and opening fire, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had not yet established a motive.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Many people passed the suspect, but he appeared to wait for his intended target,” Tisch said, adding that the shooting "does not appear to be a random act of violence.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Surveillance video reviewed by investigators shows someone emerging from behind a parked car, pointing a gun at Thompson’s back, then firing multiple times from several feet away.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gunman continues firing, interrupted by a brief gun jam, as Thompson stumbles forward and falls to the pavement. He then walks past Thompson and out of the frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From watching the video, it does seem that he’s proficient in the use of firearms as he was able to clear the malfunctions pretty quickly,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thompson was shot at least once in the back and once in the calf, Tisch said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooter, who wore a jacket, face mask and large backpack, fled through midtown on foot before pedalling an electric bike into Central Park a few blocks away, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assailant remained at large Wednesday afternoon, sparking a search that included police drones, helicopters and dogs. (AP)

<img alt="Prime minister Michel Barnier will now have to submit his resignation to President Emmanuel Macron. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782146_1_20241205051654.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French lawmakers on Wednesday voted to oust the government of Prime Minister Michel Barnier after just three months in office, an historic move which hurled the country further into political uncertainty.
 <br>
  <br>
  For the first time in over sixty years, the National Assembly lower house toppled the incumbent government, approving a no-confidence motion that had been proposed by the hard left but which crucially was backed by the far-right headed by Marine Le Pen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barnier's rapid ejection from office comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer which resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the government's survival.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Emmanuel Macron now has the unenviable choice of picking a viable successor with more than two years of his presidential term left.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is to address the nation at 1900 GMT on Thursday, the Elysee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Assembly debated a motion brought by the hard left in a standoff over next year's austerity budget, after the prime minister on Monday forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet confirmed Barnier would now have to "submit his resignation" to Macron and declared the session closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up his three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, an apparent world away from the domestic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  He strolled earlier on Wednesday through the desert sands of the Al-Ula oasis, an iconic tourist project of the kingdom, marvelling at ancient landmarks. After landing, he headed direct to the Elysee Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now calling on Macron to go," Mathilde Panot, the head of the parliamentary faction of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party told reporters, urging "early presidential elections" to solve the deepening political crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  But taking care not to crow over the fall of the government, Le Pen said in a television interview that her party – once a new premier is appointed – "would let them work" and help create a "budget that is acceptable for everyone."
  <br>
  <br>
  Laurent Wauquiez, the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far-right and hard-left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote that will "plunge the country into instability."
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron on Tuesday had rejected calls to resign, saying such a scenario amounted to "political fiction."
  <br>
  <br>
  With markets nervous and France bracing for public-sector strikes against the threat of cutbacks, action that will shut schools and hit air and rail traffic, there is a growing sense of crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unions have called for civil servants, including teachers and air traffic controllers, to strike on Thursday over separate cost-cutting measures proposed by their respective ministries this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Macron is due to host a major international event on Saturday, with the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral after the 2019 fire, with guests including Donald Trump on his first foreign trip since he was elected to be the next US president. (AFP)

    South Korean lawmakers begin Yoon impeachment push

<img alt="Thousands of protestors call for the resignation of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782131_2_20241204224300.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean lawmakers on Wednesday accused President Yoon Suk Yeol of declaring martial law to stop criminal investigations into himself and his family, as they kick-started a push to impeach him.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's declaration of South Korea's first martial law in over four decades was swiftly overturned by lawmakers in a night of drama, but has plunged the country into political turmoil and alarmed its close allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future of Yoon, a conservative politician and former star public prosecutor who was elected president in 2022, now looks highly uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  After jumping fences and tussling with security forces to get into parliament and vote down the martial law overnight, South Korea's opposition lawmakers have filed a motion to impeach Yoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motion says Yoon "gravely and extensively violated the constitution and the law" and accuses him of imposing martial law "with the unconstitutional and illegal intent to evade imminent investigations... into alleged illegal acts involving himself and his family".
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers could vote on the motion as soon as the early hours of Friday morning and Yoon's prospects look bleak.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition holds a large majority in the 300-member parliament and needs only a handful of defections from the president's party to secure the two-thirds majority needed to pass the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main opposition Democratic Party has also filed a complaint of "insurrection" against the president, some of his ministers and top military and police officials - which can carry a penalty of life imprisonment or even death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even the leader of Yoon's own ruling party described the attempt as "tragic" while calling for those involved to be held accountable.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a show of public anger with the president, thousands of protesters converged around his office in central Seoul on Wednesday evening after staging a rally in Gwanghwamun Square, demanding Yoon quit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his late-night television announcement imposing martial law on Tuesday, Yoon cited the threat of North Korea and "anti-state forces".
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 280 troops, some flown in by helicopters, arrived at parliament to lock down the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  But 190 lawmakers defied rifle-carrying soldiers to force their way into parliament to vote against the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  The constitution says martial law must be lifted when a parliamentary majority demands it, leaving Yoon with little choice but to retract his decision and call off the military in another television address six hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  By evening, Yoon had yet to publicly reappear. (AFP)

    China urges the Philippines to stop its provocations

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The China Coast Guard (CCG) on Wednesday warned Manila to stop its infringements, provocations and actions, saying that a Philippine vessel intentionally rammed into a CCG ship around the Huangyan Dao, also known as the Scarborough Shoal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Otherwise, the Philippines will be held accountable for all consequences arising from this," CCG spokesperson Liu Dejun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the CCG said the Philippines deployed coast guard vessels, official ships and fishing boats into waters around Huangyan Dao in the South China Sea as the Chinese fleet responded in accordance with the law and regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CCG said that Philippine ships "came dangerously close", adding that a Philippine vessel ignored multiple warnings, made a sharp turn, reversed and deliberately rammed into a CCG ship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu added the Philippine side was the party at fault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines said the CCG had fired water cannon and "sideswiped" a government vessel during a maritime patrol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manila also released a video appearing to show a Chinese coast guard ship firing a jet of water at the Philippines fisheries department vessel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CCG accused Manila of making "bogus accusations in an attempt to mislead international understanding".
  <br>
  <br>
  China said Huangyan Dao has always been its territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions between Manila and Beijing escalated last month when Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos signed two laws defining the country's sea waters and imposing fixed lanes for foreign ships, prompting China to summon the Philippine ambassador.
  <br>
  <br>
  And ties frayed further when the Philippines and the United States signed a security deal allowing both sides to share classified information. (Xinhua/AFP)

 South Korea's opposition parties on Wednesday said they had tabled a motion to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol.
 <br>
  <br>
  A member of the opposition told reporters the vote to impeach President Yoon could happen as early as Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is facing mounting legislative and public pressure to leave office or be forced out, hours after he ended a short-lived martial law that prompted troops to encircle parliament overnight before lawmakers voted to lift it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s senior advisers and secretaries offered to resign collectively and his Cabinet members, including Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun, were also facing calls to step down, as the nation struggled to make sense of what appeared to be a poorly-thought-out stunt. (Agencies)

    Bank of Korea to provide liquidity to support markets

<img alt="The Bank of Korea reassured investors it would take all necessary steps to stabilise the markets. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782037_1_20241204122024.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea said it would provide "sufficient liquidity" to support its financial markets on Wednesday after the country was rocked by President Yoon Suk-yeol's brief imposition of martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  Equities sank more than two percent in Seoul and the won initially plunged to a two-year low against the US dollar after the dramatic move, which stunned traders already concerned about the state of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a bid to limit the fallout from the crisis, the country's central bank and finance ministry moved to reassure markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As announced together with the government, it has been decided to temporarily supply sufficient liquidity until the financial and foreign exchange markets stabilise," the Bank of Korea said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that "the range of securities eligible for (repo) transactions and the target institutions will be expanded".
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who is also the Minister of Economy and Finance, said financial authorities will keep international partners informed about developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to ease concerns about our economic situation, we will closely communicate with international credit rating agencies, major countries such as the US, domestic economic organisations and financial markets, and share the situation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In addition, we will operate a 24-hour economic and financial situation inspection task force to operate a real-time monitoring system to prevent a real-time economic shock, and we will thoroughly monitor with relevant organisations to prevent any disruptions in exports."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added "the government will also do its best to ensure that the uncertainty facing our economy is quickly resolved".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he had made the shock decision, which took Seoul's global allies by off guard, "to safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness".
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he backed down hours later when lawmakers voted to oppose the declaration, while thousands of protesters took to the streets and the nation's largest umbrella labour union called an "indefinite general strike" until Yoon resigned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts warned that while the U-turn meant the impact of the night's extraordinary events would be tempered, the country could still face further turmoil in the economy, with worries about US President-elect Donald Trump trade policy also causing concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a macro perspective, South Korea was already one of the more vulnerable countries to the impact of Trump's proposed tariffs," said MUFG's senior currency analyst Michael Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This recent development could raise some further risk premium on the currency at least until we get clarity on political stability." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday said it would initiate impeachment proceedings against President Yoon Suk-yeol unless he immediately resigned, after his short-lived declaration of martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon "does not resign immediately, the Democratic Party will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings in line with the will of the people," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A coalition of lawmakers from opposition parties said they planned to propose a bill to impeach Yoon on Wednesday which should be voted within 72 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The parliament should focus on immediately suspending the president’s business to pass an impeachment bill soonest,” Hwang Un-ha, one of the MPs in the coalition, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's chief of staff and senior secretaries offered to resign en masse, a presidential official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon told the nation in a TV address that martial law was needed to defend the country from nuclear-armed North Korea and pro-North anti-state forces, and protect its free constitutional order, although he cited no specific threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chaotic scenes ensued as helmeted troops climbed into the parliament building through smashed windows and military helicopters hovered overhead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliamentary aides sprayed fire extinguishers to push the soldiers back, and protesters scuffled with police outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military said activities by parliament and political parties would be banned, and that media and publishers would be under the control of the martial law command.
  <br>
  <br>
  But within hours of the declaration, South Korea's parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, unanimously passed a motion requiring martial law be lifted, including all 18 members present from Yoon's party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president then rescinded the declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters outside the National Assembly shouted and clapped. “We won!” they chanted, and one demonstrator banged on a drum.
  <br>
  <br>
  More protests are expected on Wednesday with South Korea's largest union coalition, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, planning to hold a rally in Seoul and vowing to strike until Yoon resigns. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Wednesday he would lift martial law, just hours after imposing it in a bid to quell what he called "anti-state forces."
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon backed down after lawmakers voted to oppose the unexpected declaration, which caught even South Korea's closest allies around the world off guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier the National Assembly was sealed and troops entered the building for a short time, while hundreds of protesters gathered outside and faced off with security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just a moment ago, there was a demand from the National Assembly to lift the state of emergency, and we have withdrawn the military that was deployed for martial law operations," Yoon said in a televised address around 4:30 am (1930 GMT Tuesday).
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will accept the National Assembly's request and lift the martial law through the Cabinet meeting."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap news agency reported that Yoon's cabinet approved the motion to lift the order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The U-turn prompted jubilation among protesters outside parliament who had braved freezing temperatures to keep vigil through the night in defiance of Yoon's martial law order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators waving banners and South Korean flags and chanting "Arrest Yoon Sul Yeol" outside the National Assembly erupted in cheers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lim Myeong-pan, 55, said that Yoon's decision to rescind martial law did not absolve him of wrongdoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yoon's act of imposing it in the first place without legitimate cause is a serious crime in itself," said Lim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has paved his own path to impeachment with this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 190 lawmakers had managed to get into the assembly in the early hours of Wednesday, where they unanimously voted in favour of a motion to block the martial law declaration and call for its lifting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the constitution, martial law must be lifted when a majority in parliament demands it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon had given a range of reasons to justify martial law – South Korea's first in more than 40 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness, I hereby declare emergency martial law," Yoon said in a live televised address late on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon did not give details of the North's threats, but the South remains technically at war with nuclear-armed Pyongyang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, a den of legislative dictatorship that seeks to paralyse the judicial and administrative systems and overturn our liberal democratic order," Yoon said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon described the imposition of martial law as "inevitable to guarantee the continuity of a liberal South Korea," adding that it would not impact the country's foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the current situation as South Korea "on the verge of collapse, with the National Assembly acting as a monster intent on bringing down liberal democracy." (AFP)

 South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol on Tuesday declared emergency martial law, saying the measure was necessary to protect the country from "communist forces".
 <br>
  <br>
  "To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements... I hereby declare emergency martial law," Yoon said in a live televised address to the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He declared the step as critical for defending the country's constitutional order. It wasn't immediately clear how the steps would affect the country's governance and democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon since taking office in 2022 had struggled to push his agendas against an opposition-controlled parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's conservative People Power Party had been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition Democratic Party over next year’s budget bill. He has also been dismissing calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon's announcement. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 King Charles and Keir Starmer welcomed Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, for a state visit to Britain on Tuesday that the prime minister hopes will help build on the Gulf state's investment in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The emir and wife Sheikha Jawaher bint Hamad bin Suhaim Al Thani arrived by car at Horse Guards Parade in London with Prince William and his wife Kate, who was marking her return to formal state visit duties after undergoing preventative chemotherapy for cancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charles, who is continuing his own treatment for cancer, and the emir inspected the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards while a military band played.
  <br>
  <br>
  The morning of pageantry was to be followed by a trip to Westminster where the emir will address both chambers of the Houses of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain is seeking deeper ties with the wealthy Gulf state, and Starmer hopes to use the visit to secure "tangible benefits" for the country on security and the economy, his spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer was elected in July on a promise to lift economic growth and is looking to potential wealthy investors such as Qatar to help fund his plans for new infrastructure and energy developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatar is already a big investor in Britain through the Qatar Investment Authority which owns the Canary Wharf business and entertainment district in east London, the Shard landmark skyscraper in central London, and stakes in bluechip names such as Barclays and Heathrow Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can expect them to discuss how we can build further on our two countries' thriving trade and investment partnership," the prime minister's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two royal families departed by horse-drawn carriage for Buckingham Palace where they were due to have lunch with Queen Camilla, who was absent from the outdoor event as she continues to recover from a chest infection. (Reuters)

    EU pushes for outdoor vaping and smoking ban

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU countries agreed on Tuesday on a push for stricter anti-smoking rules, backing bans on smoking and vaping in many outdoor areas including playgrounds and cafe patios.
 <br>
  <br>
  A recommendation inviting member states to crack down on second-hand smoke and vapour was adopted by health ministers from the bloc's 27 nations meeting in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's agreement is a crucial step towards our goal of a tobacco-free generation in Europe, and is critical in protecting our children and young people from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke," said the EU's health commissioner, Oliver Varhelyi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recommendation is non-binding, as health is a competence of individual member states.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it gives an indication of the policies governments could pursue in the future as they seek to reduce smoke-related deaths and ailments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It passed with all countries voting in favour apart from Germany and Greece, which abstained, underscoring some political divisions on the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the European Parliament voted against a similar text.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document approved on Tuesday calls on EU countries to extend restrictions in place for cigarettes to cover "emerging products", such as heated tobacco devices and electronic cigarettes that are increasingly popular with young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Governments should "provide effective protection" from aerosols emitted by these in indoor environments such as offices and public buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following an initial proposal put forward by the European Commission in September, the text says such protection should also be granted in some outdoor areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  This in practice entails that all smoking should be banned in locations including swimming pools, beaches, zoos, rooftop bars and restaurant terraces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The push comes as the EU is aiming to reduce its smoking population from around 25 percent now to less than five percent of the total by 2040, as part of its "Beating Cancer Plan".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tobacco use is estimated to kill more than eight million people globally each year, including about 1.3 million non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke, World Health Organization (WHO) statistics show.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emissions from electronic cigarettes also typically contain nicotine and other toxic substances that are harmful including to second-hand smokers, according to the WHO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But treating smoking and vaping the same way is contentious.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint declaration ahead of the vote, Italy and Romania said calls for a ban on outdoor vaping lacked scientific basis and should have not been included in the recommendation. The two countries nevertheless backed the text.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany abstained saying that the issue fell within the competences of its regions -- not the central government -- and some opposed a ban on smoking in outdoor terraces and patios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece similarly voiced scepticism about the effect of such rules, saying more scientific data was needed on the effects of e-cigarettes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Parliament last week voted against a resolution on the same subject, after lawmakers on the right passed amendments to differentiate between traditional tobacco products and electronic devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  This drew the ire of the left, which had supported the original text but rejected its watered down version.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see the outdoor smoking ban as a violation of individual freedom," Pietro Fiocchi, a lawmaker with the hard-right ECR group, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parliamentary resolution, which would have had only symbolic value, was turned down with 378 votes against and only 152 in favour. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from flooding in southern Thailand has risen to 25, officials said on Tuesday, with days more heavy rain forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  Twelve provinces in southern Thailand have been hit by flooding since late November, affecting more than 410,000 people, the country's disaster agency said on its Facebook page.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency's announcement raises a previous death toll of nine reported on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 22,000 people have been displaced from their homes due to flooding in Pattani, Narathiwat, Songkhla and Yala provinces, the Thai government's public relations department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Suwas Bin-Uma, a chicken farm owner in Songkhla, told state broadcaster Thai PBS that the floods had wiped out his entire flock of more than 10,000 chickens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've lost at least three million baht (US$87,000)," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai weather agency on Tuesday warned of continued heavy rain until December 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has deployed rescue teams to assist affected residents and designated 50 million baht in flood relief for each province.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday the Thai cabinet approved a 9,000 baht payment per family to support those affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring Malaysia, south of the Thai border, disaster officials said on Tuesday that more than 94,000 people were yet to return to their homes after being evacuated to shelters due to the floods, with at least five people reported dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said five days of heavier-than-expected rain that battered the country's east coast last week was equal to the rainfall over the past six months, wreaking havoc in the northeastern state of Kelantan and neighbouring Terengganu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heavy downpours damaged roads and houses in Kelantan and other parts of Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue workers used boats to distribute food to victims trapped in their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anwar said it would cost the government an estimated 1 billion ringgit (US$224 million) to repair infrastructure damaged by the floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rain eased over the weekend, but the Meteorological Department forecast heavy rains later on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anwar said the government is bracing for another monsoon surge that is expected to hit on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say climate change is causing more intense weather patterns that can make destructive floods more likely. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China lifted trade restrictions on two Australian meat processing facilities, allowing the full resumption of red meat exports to the country, the Australian government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has now removed restrictions from all 10 Australian abattoirs it banned between 2020 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bans were imposed around the time that China blocked imports of commodities including coal, barley and wine from Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all those restrictions have been removed since a new government won power in Canberra in 2022, with trade in lobster, the final banned product, set to restart by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is great news for Australian exporters, producers and farmers," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since we were elected we've worked tirelessly to resume trade and that's exactly what we are seeing. It's a win for trade and a win for Australian jobs."
  <br>
  <br>
  China is the second largest market for Australian beef and veal after the United States, receiving around 200,000 metric tonnes a year worth around US$1.5 billion in recent years, Australian trade data showed. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A court in Vietnam on Tuesday upheld a death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan after rejecting her appeal against a conviction for embezzlement and bribery in a high-profile US$12 billion fraud case, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lan, the chairwoman of real estate developer Van Thinh Phat Holdings Group, was sentenced to death in April for her role in what was Vietnam's biggest financial fraud case on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High People's Court in Ho Chi Minh City determined there was no basis to reduce Lan's death sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Lan is able to return three-quarters of the money embezzled while on death row, it is possible the sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment, local media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is one of the most famous business executives and state officials jailed in the country's lengthy anti-graft campaign known as "Blazing Furnace".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The consequences Lan caused are unprecedented in the history of litigation and the amount of money embezzled is unprecedentedly large and unrecoverable," the prosecution was quoted as saying at the appeal hearing by state-run online newspaper VietnamNet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The defendant's actions have affected many aspects of society, the financial market, the economy," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media cited Lan's lawyer as saying she had many mitigating circumstances, including "having admitted guilt, showing remorse and paying back part of the amount of money embezzled", but prosecutors said that was insufficient.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan still has the right to request a review under Vietnam's retrial procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan's arrest in 2022 sparked a run on one of the country's largest private banks by deposits, Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank, which was at the centre of the fraud and largely owned by Lan through her proxies. (Reuters)

    World Court urged to recognise climate change harms

<div class="itemFullText">
 The future of the planet is at stake during hearings at the top United Nations court, a representative for Vanuatu said on Monday, opening a historic case that aims to set a legal framework on how countries should tackle climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 countries and organisations are set to present before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the next two weeks, the highest number ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The outcome of these proceedings will reverberate across generations, determining the fate of nations like mine and the future of our planet," said Vanuatu's representative for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This may well be the most consequential case in the history of humanity," Regenvanu told the 15-judge bench in the panelled hall of the Peace Palace in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Activists hope the ICJ opinion will have far-reaching legal consequences in the fight against climate change, impacting ongoing court cases as well as domestic and international legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others fear the UN-backed request for a non-binding advisory opinion will have limited impact - and it could take the UN's highest court months, or even years, to deliver.
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of protesters gathered outside the Peace Palace, near a big screen reading "We are watching".
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators had hung banners saying: "Biggest problem to the highest court" and "Fund our future, climate finance now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The presentations at the scenic Peace Palace come days after a bitterly negotiated climate deal at the COP29 summit in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy polluting countries ultimately agreed to find at least US$300 billion a year by 2035 to help poorer nations transition to cleaner energy sources and prepare for increasing climate impacts such as extreme weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries condemned the pledge as too little, too late, and the summit's final deal failed to include a global pledge to move away from burning planet-heating fossil fuels. (AFP)

<img alt="The government of Michel Barnier could be toppled as early as Wednesday. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781810_1_20241203043044.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Michel Barnier faced an abrupt end to his premiership on Monday after key opposition parties said they would back a no-confidence motion against his government after only three months in power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Certain that the National Assembly would deny him a majority backing the government's social security financing plan for next year, Barnier forced through the bill without a vote, using executive powers under article 49.3 of the French constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative premier, who formed a minority government in September after an inconclusive general election, has lived under the constant threat of a no-confidence vote that could force him to quit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government could be toppled as early as Wednesday, when a vote is expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barnier called it "a moment of truth in which everybody must take their responsibilities", warning against lawmakers putting "partisan interests" before the "best interest of the nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Far-left opposition party LFI said immediately it would bring a no-confidence motion which the far-right National Rally (RN) - the largest single party in France's parliament - said it would vote in favour of, after accusing Barnier of failing to negotiate on some of the bill's provisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key to any such vote is Marine Le Pen, the parliamentary leader of the RN that has opposed several parts of the government's 2025 budget plan, including the social security financing bill submitted to the assembly on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a last-ditch concession to the RN, Barnier's office said it was scrapping plans for a less generous prescription drug reimbursement policy from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the nod to Le Pen's concerns was not enough to avert the no-confidence motion for Barnier, who has little hope of finding any left-wing support. (AFP)

    Dozens dead in stampede at Guinea football match

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A deadly stampede at a football match killed at least 56 people in Guinea's second city N'Zerekore, the government said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The events at Sunday's match, which were initially reported as clashes between fans, were triggered after a player was sent off at the end of the game, witnesses said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match in the southeastern city was the final of a tournament organised in honour of Guinea's junta leader, Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup and has installed himself as president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition has accused the junta of using sport for political ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses said fans invaded the pitch following the referee's decision, with some attacking the stand designated for officials, prompting the intervention of security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Protests of dissatisfaction with refereeing decisions led to stone-throwing by supporters, resulting in fatal stampedes," said a government statement which was read out on national television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hospital services have put the provisional death toll at 56, with several others injured," it added, describing the incident as a "tragic event".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government assures the public that investigations will be carried out to establish who is responsible for this unfortunate event," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young people also set fire to a police station overnight, according to public television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah condemned the "incidents that marred the match between the teams of Labe and N'Zerekore", in a post on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is following the situation and reiterates its call for calm so as not to impede hospital services from aiding the injured," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported that hospital wards and a morgue were overwhelmed by the injured and dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such tournaments and other public gatherings have become common in the West African nation, in what is widely seen as a campaign to promote Doumbouya's candidacy in any future presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military seized power by force in September 2021 by overthrowing civilian President Alpha Conde.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under international pressure, the junta pledged to hand power back to a civilian government by the end of 2024 but has since made clear it will not. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An impeachment complaint was filed on Monday against Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing a legal storm over a death threat she made against the president, the alleged misuse of government funds by her office and other criminal accusations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The impeachment bid filed by several prominent opponents and activists in the House of Representatives accuses Duterte of violating the country’s Constitution, massive corruption and other “high crimes,” including the death threats she made against the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president's legal troubles have unfolded in the backdrop of her increasingly bitter political feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in online news conference on November 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Speaker Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned was not a joke.
  <br>
  <br>
  She later said she was not threatening him but was expressing concern for her own safety. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Georgia fired tear gas and water cannon on Sunday on a fourth straight day of pro-EU protests that drew tens of thousands of people, as the prime minister rebuffed calls for new elections.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party claimed victory in October 26 parliamentary polls that the pro-European opposition said were fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turmoil has deepened since Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced on Thursday that Georgia was shelving accession talks with the European Union until 2028, sparking a wave of protests in the capital, Tbilisi, and other cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition is boycotting the new parliament, while pro-EU President Salome Zurabishvili has asked the constitutional court to annul the election result, declaring the new legislature and government "illegitimate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics accuse Georgian Dream, in power for more than a decade, of having steered the country away from the EU in recent years, an accusation it denies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry has said about 150 demonstrators have been arrested in this latest protest wave, while the Georgian Young Lawyers' Association put the number at 200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in some instances have chased protesters through the streets, beating them and firing rubber bullets and tear gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Waving European and Georgian flags, tens of thousands rallied outside parliament on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some demonstrators tossed fireworks and stones at riot police, while others banged on the metal door blocking parliament's entrance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later fired water cannon, but were unable to disperse the crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late at night, riot police in full gear moved in, using tear gas and water cannon to disperse the rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the opposition United National Movement party, Levan Khabeishvili, told journalists that he was attacked by around 15 masked police officers attempting to detain him, but said he had managed to escape with the help of protesters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another protest took place outside the offices of Georgia's Public Broadcaster, widely accused of acting as a propaganda tool for the ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broadcaster conceded to the protesters' demand to grant Zurabishvili airtime, which it had previously denied her.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simultaneous protests took place in cities across Georgia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fuelling popular anger, Kobakhidze ruled out new parliamentary elections, saying that "the formation of the new government based on the October 26 parliamentary elections has been completed".
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this week, the party nominated far-right former football international Mikheil Kavelashvili for the largely ceremonial post of president.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zurabishvili told AFP in an exclusive interview on Saturday that she would not step down until last month's contested parliamentary elections are re-run.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels has not recognised the outcome of the October elections, and demanded an investigation into "serious electoral irregularities".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Parliament has called for a re-run and for sanctions against top Georgian officials, including Kobakhidze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zurabishvili on Saturday said that she was "the only legitimate institution in the country", and that "as long as there are no new elections... my mandate continues".
  <br>
  <br>
  Constitutional law experts have questioned the legitimacy of the new parliament, citing the fact it approved its own credentials in violation of a requirement to await a court ruling on Zurabishvili's bid to annul the election results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of public servants, including from the ministries of foreign affairs, defence and education, as well as a number of judges, issued joint statements protesting Kobakhidze's decision to postpone EU accession talks. (AFP)

    Left-wing looks set for gains in Romanian election

<div class="itemFullText">
 Romania's ruling leftist Social Democrats (PSD) looked set to win the most votes in a parliamentary election on Sunday, fending off a resurgent far-right movement that challenged the country's pro-Western orientation, partial results showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vote is the second of three consecutive ballots for both a new parliament and a new president, after the first round of the presidential election on November 24 saw an independent far-right candidate, Calin Georgescu, emerge from relative obscurity to become the frontrunner.
  <br>
  <br>
  His unexpected win ushered in support for ultra-nationalist, hard-right parties, some with overt pro-Russian sympathies, which political analysts said could undermine Romania's support for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  If final results confirm the preliminary count, a pro-Western coalition led by the PSD would likely have enough seats in parliament to form a government, although the far right would be a substantial force in the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a broad coalition would be difficult to form amid disagreements over reforms and measures needed to rein in the country's gaping budget deficit, now the highest in the EU at eight percent of economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a campaign dominated by voters' concerns over budget problems and the cost of living, the election pitted the far-right contenders against pro-European mainstream parties that have angered their voters with infighting and corruption allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Far-right parties have also used Romania's championing of Ukraine to stoke fears the war could spill over the border unless the country halts its support, as well as resentment over alleged preferential treatment for refugees from Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romania has the EU's biggest share of the population at risk of poverty, and swathes of the country need investment to attract jobs. (Reuters)

<img alt="A vehicle on fire in the aftermath of what the White Helmets said was an strike on Idlib, with the Syrian government vowing to drive out rebel forces from northwest Syria. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781715_1_20241202121126.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 25 people were killed in northwestern Syria in air strikes carried out by the Syrian government and Russia, the Syrian opposition-run rescue service known as the White Helmets said early on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russian and Syrian jets struck the rebel-held city of Idlib in northern Syria on Sunday, military sources said, as President Bashar al-Assad vowed to crush insurgents who had swept into the city of Aleppo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army also said it had recaptured several towns that rebels had overrun in recent days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Insurgents led by jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched a two-pronged attack on Aleppo and the countryside around Idlib last Wednesday, before moving toward neighbouring Hama province.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, government troops created a “strong defensive line” in northern Hama, as they attempted to stall the insurgents’ momentum, according to Britain-based opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent, destabilising front reopening in the Middle East at a time when Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, conflicts that have repeatedly threatened to ignite an even wider regional war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also risks drawing Russia and Turkey — each with its own interests to protect in Syria — into direct heavy fighting against each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The insurgents announced their offensive last Wednesday, just as a ceasefire started between Hezbollah and Israel that raised some hope tensions in the region might be calming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The surprise offensive is an embarrassment for Assad, and it comes at a time when his allies — Iran and groups it backs and Russia — are preoccupied with their own conflicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement from Assad’s office, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reassured the Syrian leader during a visit to Damascus that Tehran was ready to support the government in their counter-offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab leaders, including Jordan’s King Abdullah II and United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, have also called Assad to express their solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions, has ground on since 2011 with no formal end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the heavy fighting stopped years ago after Iran-backed militias and Russian air power helped Assad win control of all major cities. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Biden on Sunday issued an official pardon for his son Hunter, who is facing sentencing for two criminal cases related to tax evasion and the purchase of a firearm.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son -- and that is wrong," the president said in a statement, calling it "a miscarriage of justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The younger Biden was convicted earlier this year of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun -- a felony -- and has also pleaded guilty in a separate tax evasion trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pardon comes after Biden has repeatedly said he wouldn't intervene in his son's legal troubles. The White House press secretary said as recently as September that Biden wouldn't issue a pardon for Hunter.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, criminal cases against President-elect Donald Trump have come to a standstill after a sweeping ruling on presidential immunity by the Supreme Court -- all but ensuring Biden's Republican rival will likely never see a jail cell, even after his landmark conviction for falsifying business records in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted," Biden said in Sunday's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice." (AFP)

    Kuwait ruler urges immediate Gaza ceasefire

<img alt="Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah (left0 also called on the international community to provide protection for innocent civilians. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781644_1_20241201212541.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kuwait's ruler on Sunday urged an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as he addressed a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council held after nearly 14 months of war in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah called on the international community to implement "an immediate ceasefire, providing international protection for innocent civilians and ensuring the opening of safe corridors and the arrival of urgent humanitarian aid".
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting of the six-member GCC comes at a time of acute and ongoing uncertainty for the Middle East following Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel and a subsequent war on Gaza, which has repeatedly threatened spillover into a wider regional conflagration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheikh Meshal hit out at what he characterised as the "double standards in the application of relevant international laws, charters and resolutions" which he said had undermined "the region's security and stability".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Kuwait was "optimistic" about a ceasefire agreed between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that he said would contribute "to reducing escalation in the region".
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar and other countries also welcomed last week's a truce after a year of conflict that killed thousands in Lebanon and caused mass displacement on both sides of the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting escalated in September after continuous cross-border strikes, initiated by Iran-backed Hezbollah in support of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kuwaiti ruler spoke in support of Saudi's work to form a global body pushing for an independent Palestinian state and lauded "positive and constructive" work by Iran and the GCC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia had appeared close to a normalisation deal with Israel prior to October 2023 but Riyadh indicated it was unwilling to move ahead while Israel pursued its campaign in Gaza, hardening its position in recent months saying it would not recognise Israel without an independent Palestinian state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anxious about being drawn into tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and nearby Iran, also precipitated by fighting in Gaza, the wealthy and traditionally western-allied Gulf monarchies have sought to cultivate improved relations with Tehran.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli air raid on Iran in October was the most recent in a series of retaliatory attacks between the two countries. (AFP)

    Centre-right parties to retain power in Ireland

<img alt="Irish police officers stand by as ballot papers are counted in Dublin. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781636_1_20241201195656.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The incumbent centre-right parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael looked set to retain power in Ireland as vote counting in the European Union member's general election resumed on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With around 45 seats of the new 174-seat lower chamber of parliament decided, the parties were ahead of the main opposition party, the left-wing nationalist Sinn Fein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media projected Fianna Fail, led by the experienced Micheal Martin, 64, would win the largest vote share and over 40 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fine Gael, whose leader Simon Harris, 38, is the outgoing prime minister (taoiseach), were in second place according to projections, with Sinn Fein in third.
  <br>
  <br>
  To form a majority, a party or coalition requires at least 88 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both centre-right parties have repeatedly ruled out entering a coalition with Sinn Fein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left opposition Labour party is seen by Fine Gael and Fianna Fail as the most likely junior coalition party, according to local media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Green Party was the third member of the previous coalition but its support collapsed nationwide, with all but one seat likely to be lost.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the last general election in 2020, the pro-Irish unity Sinn Fein -- the former political wing of the paramilitary Irish Republican Army -- was the most popular party but could not find willing coalition partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  That led to weeks of horse-trading, ending up with Fine Gael, which has been in power since 2011, agreeing a deal with Fianna Fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the last parliamentary term, the role of prime minister rotated between the Fianna Fail and Fine Gael leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final seat numbers, which will not be confirmed until early next week, will determine whether Harris returns as taoiseach or Martin takes the role under a rotation arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new parliament is due to sit for the first time on December 18, but following coalition talks a new government is not expected to be formed until the new year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-week campaign, launched after Harris called a snap election on November 8, was dominated by rancour over housing supply and cost-of-living crises, health, public spending, and the economy. (AFP)

    EU foreign policy chief warns Georgian authorities

<img alt="Kaja Kallas, who took office on Sunday with a visit to Ukraine, said " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781619_1_20241201173234.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's new foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Sunday warned Georgian authorities over violence against demonstrators protesting the government's decision to shelve its bid to join the bloc.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear that using violence against peaceful protesters is not acceptable, and the Georgian government should respect the will of the Georgian people," Kallas told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When it comes to European Union, then this clearly has consequences on our relationship with Georgia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kallas, who took office on Sunday with a visit to Ukraine, said "options" had been put forward to the EU's 27 member states on how to respond, including potentially imposing sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have different options. But of course, we need to come to agreement," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violent clashes erupted on Saturday outside Georgia's parliament between police and demonstrators protesting the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis, AFP reporters witnessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people gathered in Georgia's capital Tbilisi on Saturday for a third night of protests that saw dozens arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-European opposition said was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chaotic scenes unfolded for hours as police chased defiant protesters through the streets of central Tbilisi, beating them and making arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masked officers in riot gear fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons as they moved in to disperse protesters hurling fireworks, while flames were seen coming from a window of the parliament building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators erected barricades on Tbilisi's main avenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said "the actions of some individuals present at the protest became violent" and that police would "respond appropriately and in accordance with the law to every violation".
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have been arrested in the last two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's announcement on Thursday that Georgia would not seek accession talks with the EU until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition. (AFP)

    'Obstruction' blocking pact on plastic pollution

<img alt="Environmentalists have demanded stronger commitments to fight plastic waste at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee in Busan. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781577_1_20241201094724.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France on Sunday accused a handful of countries of obstructing negotiations in South Korea to reach the world's first treaty to curb plastic pollution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also are worried by the continuing obstruction by the so-called like-minded countries," Olga Givernet, France's minister delegate for energy, told reporters, referring to a group of mostly oil-producing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 200 countries are in the port city of Busan for negotiations on a deal to curb plastic pollution, with only a few hours left on the clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Finding an agreement for us on (an) ambitious treaty that reduces plastic pollution remains an absolute priority for France," Givernet said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning on pushing it, pushing it again."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of plastic is not recycled, while plastic production is expected to triple by 2060.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to reach the landmark agreement have been locked over several key sticking points, particularly reducing production and phasing out chemicals believed or known to harm human health.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 countries back those measures and insist a treaty without them will fail to solve the pollution crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  But around a dozen nations -- mostly producers of plastic precursors derived from fossil fuels -- are strongly opposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still have a few hours left in these negotiations, there is time to find common ground, but Rwanda cannot accept a toothless treaty," said Juliet Kabera, director general of the Rwanda Environment Management Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest draft text remains full of opposing views and contradictory language, and a promised new version after long hours of negotiations into Saturday night has not yet been published.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to fight for an ambitious outcome in Busan," Givernet said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have still a few hours to discuss and make contributions and be certain that our determination (is) to carry on with the negotiation process until the last hour." (AFP)

    Gaza rescuers say 3 aid workers die in Israeli strike

<img alt="The car carrying the aid workers was almost completely destroyed by the strike in Khan Younis. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781558_1_20241130221340.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said three aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike in the Hamas-run territory on Saturday but the Israeli army said it killed a "terrorist."
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency said the aid workers killed were Palestinian employees of World Central Kitchen (WCK). The US aid group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army said it had "struck a vehicle with a terrorist that took part in the murderous October 7 massacre," referring to the militant group Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The claim that the terrorist was simultaneously a WCK worker is being examined," it added in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the bodies of "at least five dead were transported (to hospital), including (those of) the three employees of World Central Kitchen."
  <br>
  <br>
  "All three men worked for WCK and they were hit while driving in a WCK jeep in Khan Younis," Bassal said, adding that the vehicle had been "marked with its logo clearly visible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army insisted its strike in the main southern city hit "a civilian unmarked vehicle and its movement on the route was not coordinated for transporting of aid."
  <br>
  <br>
  In April, an Israeli air strike killed seven WCK staff – an Australian, three Britons, a North American, a Palestinian and a Pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said it had been targeting a "Hamas gunman" in that strike but the military admitted a series of "grave mistakes" and violations of its own rules of engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,207 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed 44,382 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

    Serbia denies involvement in Kosovo canal blast

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kosovo stepped up security measures around "critical" infrastructure on Saturday after an explosion at a key canal feeding two of its main power plants, as neighbouring Serbia rejected accusations it had staged the blast.
 <br>
  <br>
  The explosion occurred on Friday near the town of Zubin Potok in a Serb-dominated area in Kosovo's troubled north, damaging the canal supplying water to cooling systems at two coal-fired power plants that generate most of Kosovo's electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Albin Kurti called a security meeting late on Friday, saying: "This is a criminal and terrorist attack aimed at damaging our critical infrastructure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The attack was carried out by professionals. We believe it comes from gangs directed by Serbia," he added without providing any evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government later issued a statement echoing his allegations, saying that "initial indications suggest" the explosion had been "orchestrated by the Serbian state, which has the capacity to carry out such a criminal and terrorist attack."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kosovo also "approved additional measures to strengthen security around essential infrastructure and services, such as bridges, transformers" and other sites, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serbia slapped back on Saturday, condemning the attack, while calling the accusation "premature" and "baseless."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such destructive actions are unacceptable and threaten the fragile stability we are striving to maintain," Serbian Foreign Minister Marko Djuric said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Serbia unequivocally demands responsibility for the perpetrators of this reckless attack," he added, while suggesting the Kosovar "regime" could be behind the blast and calling for an internationally-led investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main political party representing Serbs in Kosovo, Serb List, also condemned the attack "in the strongest possible terms."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pictures from the scene published by local media showed water leaking heavily from one side of the reinforced canal, which runs from the Serb-majority north of Kosovo to the capital Pristina and also supplies drinking water.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, electricity supplies to consumers were running smoothly on Saturday morning, with authorities having found an alternative method for cooling the plants, Kosovo's Economy Minister Artane Rizvanolli said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Repair work was ongoing, authorities said. (AFP)

 Greenpeace activists boarded a tanker off South Korea on Saturday in an action intended to draw attention to calls for a treaty to curb plastic pollution, the environmental group said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 200 countries are in Busan to negotiate the deal, but there is little sign of agreement with just a day left before talks are due to end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greenpeace said the tanker Buena Alba, anchored off the Hanwha TotalEnergies complex, was scheduled to pick up propylene, which is used to manufacture plastic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The activists boarded the vessel peacefully and met no reaction from the vessel crew," said Greenpeace spokeswoman Angelica Pago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We painted 'PLASTIC KILLS' on the side of the vessel and the climbers successfully set up a camp," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They intend to stay in order to continue putting pressure on the negotiators to resist fossil fuel and petrochemical industry interference in the talks and to deliver a treaty that firmly cuts plastic production."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for South Korea's coast guard said police had been "deployed on the ship, and we are making warning announcements to facilitate a safe disembarkation."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a "thorough investigation" would be carried out to determine if there were any "illegal elements" to the protest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attempts to reach an agreement on curbing plastic pollution have stalled over several key sticking points, including whether to cut new plastic production.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of countries, backed by environmental groups, insist a treaty without production cuts will fail to solve the problem, but a group of largely oil-producing states is fiercely opposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The brave activists that boarded that vessel today show the courage and should inspire governments here to hold the line and do what everyone knows is obvious," Greenpeace delegation head Graham Forbes told reporters in Busan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The negotiations have reached a "pivotal moment," he said, but "a handful of governments... are looking backwards and refusing to take the steps necessary for us all to advance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we are at a very risky moment right now of being sold out, and that would be an absolute catastrophe," Forbes said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia on Saturday said 107 people were arrested during a second day of protests sparked by the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-EU opposition said was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said 107 people were detained for "disobedience to lawful police orders and petty hooliganism."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Throughout the night... protesters threw various objects, including stones, pyrotechnics, glass bottles, and metal items, at law enforcement officers," it said, adding that "10 employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were injured."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry had said that 32 police officers were wounded and 43 protestors detained on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's statement on Thursday that Georgia will not seek to open accession talks with the European Union until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition and two days of protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later accused the opposition and the EU ambassador to Georgia of distorting his words, and insisted membership in the bloc "by 2030" remains his "top priority."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, riot police fired water cannons and tear gas at pro-EU protesters gathered outside the parliament in Tbilisi, who tossed eggs and fireworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clashes broke out later between protesters and police, who moved in to clear the area outside parliament, beating demonstrators, some of whom threw objects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Independent TV station Pirveli said one of its journalists was hospitalised with serious injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests were also held in other cities across Georgia on Friday, independent TV station Mtavari reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pro-Western opposition parties are boycotting the new parliament, while President Salome Zurabishvili has sought to annul the election results through the country's constitutional court.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address to the nation on Friday evening, the pro-Western president – at loggerheads with the ruling party – said: "The resistance movement has begun... I stand in solidarity with it."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will remain united until Georgia achieves its goals: to return to its European path, secure new elections."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the October vote, a group of Georgia's leading election monitors said they had evidence of a complex scheme of large-scale electoral fraud. (AFP)

    13 more killed in Pakistan sectarian fighting

<img alt="More than 50 people have been wounded in fresh fighting which continued on Saturday morning. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781545_1_20241130183503.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sectarian feuding in northwest Pakistan killed 13 more people, a local government official said on Saturday, as warring Sunnis and Shi'ites defied repeated ceasefire orders, bringing the total death toll in a recent spasm of violence to 124.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country, but Kurram district – in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the border with Afghanistan – has a large Shi'ite population and the communities have clashed for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh fighting broke out last Thursday when two separate convoys of Shi'ite Muslims travelling under police escort were ambushed, killing more than 40.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then 10 days of fighting with light and heavy weapons has brought the region to a standstill, with major roads closed and mobile phone services cut as the death toll surged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Kurram local government official put the death toll at 124 on Saturday after 13 more people were killed in the past two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two were Sunni and 11 Shi'ite, he said, whilst more than 50 people have been wounded in fresh fighting which continued on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a severe lack of trust between the two sides, and neither tribe is willing to comply with government orders to cease hostilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police report that many people want to flee the area due to the violence, but the deteriorating security situation makes it impossible," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A seven-day ceasefire deal was announced by the provincial government last weekend but failed to hold. Another 10-day truce was brokered on Wednesday but it also failed to stymie the fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior security official in the provincial capital of Peshawar, also speaking anonymously, confirmed the total death toll of 124.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a fear of more fatalities," he said. "None of the provincial government's initiated measures have been fully implemented to restore peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have regularly struggled to control violence in Kurram, which was part of the semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas until it was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 79 people had been killed in the region between July and October in sectarian clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The feuding is generally rekindled by disputes over land in the rugged mountainous region, and fuelled by underlying tensions between the communities adhering to different sects of Islam. (AFP)
