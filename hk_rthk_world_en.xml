 China wants to achieve a "fair, lasting and binding peace agreement" acceptable to all parties on the Ukraine war, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone hopes to achieve a fair, lasting, binding peace agreement that every side can accept," Wang told reporters during an annual press conference on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to cooperate with the international community in accordance with the wishes of relevant parties to achieve a final resolution of the crisis and lasting peace, and will continue to play a constructive role."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that "conflict has no winners, and peace has no losers".
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Middle East, Wang called for a "lasting ceasefire" between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If major powers genuinely care about the people of Gaza, they should promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza and increase humanitarian assistance," Wang said. (Agencies)

    Second measles-related death in US in a decade

<div class="itemFullText">
 A New Mexico resident who has died, tested positive for measles, the state health department said on Thursday, marking the second measles-related death in the United States in more than a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unvaccinated adult patient did not seek medical care before death, and was the first measles-related death in the state in more than 40 years, according to David Morgan, Public Information Officer for the New Mexico Department of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of death is still under investigation by the state medical examiner, Morgan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death brings to 10 the number of measles cases that occurred in Lea County, located adjacent to Gaines County, Texas, where more than 100 cases and one death in an unvaccinated child have been reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outbreak, one of the largest the United States has seen in the past decade, has put US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a long-time vaccine sceptic, to the test.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a cabinet meeting last week, Kennedy initially downplayed news that a school-aged child had died of measles, calling such outbreaks ordinary and failing to mention the role of vaccination to prevent measles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, Kennedy published an opinion piece on Fox News that promoted the role of vaccination, but downplayed the role of vaccines by telling parents vaccination was a personal choice and urging them to consult with their physician.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed the role of vitamin A, overstating evidence for its use, which has only been shown to decrease measles severity in developing countries among individuals who are malnourished and vitamin A deficient, said Dr Paul Offit, an infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of February 27, 164 measles cases have been reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in nine jurisdictions: Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island, and Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measles typically kills 1 to 3 people per 1,000 cases, said Dr Tina Tan, an infectious disease expert at Northwestern University in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said two deaths out of a total of 164 cases suggest "a much higher mortality rate than we would normally see," adding that there are probably many undetected cases. (Reuters)

<img alt="President Trump listens as Rodolphe Saade, CEO of CMA CGM Group, speaks in the Oval Office. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794675_1_20250307092145.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday said French-based shipping firm CMA CGM would invest US$20 billion in the United States to build out shipping logistics and terminals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration wants to revive shipbuilding in the United States and weaken China's grip on the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's team is preparing an executive order that would impose a levy on ships linked to China when they call at US ports, and wants US allies to do the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM is the world's third-largest container shipping line and is part of a vessel-sharing alliance with companies including China's COSCO.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM said last week that US port fees on China-built ships would have a big impact on all shipping firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Thursday he would announce a new program for building ships in the United States next week or the following week, including incentives.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM CEO Rodolphe Saade, who joined Trump in the Oval Office, confirmed the US$20 billion investment and said it would create 10,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investment over four years would include expansion of container ports and the creation of an air cargo hub in Chicago supported by five new Boeing 777 freighters flown by American pilots, CMA CGM said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saade, a French-Lebanese billionaire who controls CMA CGM with other family members, told Trump at the White House that his group was looking at supporting the building of container ships and would make an announcement "in the coming weeks".
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM operates port terminals in New York and Los Angeles. The Marseille-based firm is the biggest cargo carrier for US retail giant Walmart. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Violent winds toppled power lines on Friday as a tropical cyclone inched towards Australia's eastern coast, sparking evacuation orders and leaving more than 50,000 homes without electricity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred was 165 kilometres east of Brisbane city on Friday morning, crawling towards the densely-populated coastline at "walking speed", government forecasts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some four million people were in the firing line along a 400-kilometre stretch of coastline straddling the border of Queensland state and New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a region rarely troubled by typhoons - it has been more than 50 years since a tropical cyclone made landfall in that part of Queensland.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 50,000 homes were without power on Friday morning as damaging winds brought down power lines, officials and utility companies said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said the storm already "packed a punch", warning conditions would get worse as it approached land late on Friday or early Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency response officials said they had issued evacuation orders for some 10,000 people in the flood-prone northern rivers region of New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was particular concern for the town of Lismore, which was engulfed by record 14-metre floodwaters after heavy rains in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many residents have spent the past three days fortifying their homes with sandbags, tying down loose furniture and stocking up on food and water.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the region should "hope for the best, but prepare for the worst".
  <br>
  <br>
  "When nature does its worst, Australians are at our best. We rally. We lift each other up. We look out for our neighbours," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred would likely cross the coast "early Saturday morning", the Bureau of Meteorology said, although its path was becoming difficult to predict.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was forecast to make landfall around 60 kilometres north of Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 900 schools across Queensland state and neighbouring parts of northern New South Wales were closed on Friday, education department officials said. (AFP)

    SpaceX loses contact with Starship rocket after launch

<img alt="The Super Heavy booster returns to its launch pad after the SpaceX Starship spacecraft continued to space following its launch on its eighth test. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794668_1_20250307085312.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's SpaceX saw mixed results in the latest test launch of its Starship mega-rocket on Thursday, successfully catching the massive booster but with the upper stage failing for the second consecutive time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Minutes after lift-off and booster separation, a video live feed showed the upper stage tumbling uncontrollably, with signal soon cutting out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can confirm we did lose contact with the ship. Unfortunately, this happened last time, too," SpaceX official Dan Huot said, alluding to the January launch that saw the upper stage explode over the Caribbean, raining debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new setback could fuel questions over Musk's attention to his space company, as the billionaire spends most of his time in Washington leading US President Donald Trump's government overhaul efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  That work has also prompted mounted scrutiny over Musk's influence on the US government space program.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starship, the world's biggest and most powerful launch vehicle, successfully blasted off from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas shortly after 5:30 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Starship's eighth orbital mission - all so far uncrewed - and the first since its dramatic mid-air explosion over the Caribbean during its last trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite losing contact with the upper stage again, SpaceX managed to return the huge booster stage to the launch tower - catching it with arms called "chopsticks." It was the third time SpaceX completed the tricky engineering feat.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 minutes after the launch, Spacex turned off its livestream and the fate of the errant upper stage was not immediately known. (AFP)

    Trump backs off Mexico, Canada tariffs

<img alt="US President Donald Trump said after a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that fresh tariffs targeting Mexico would not apply to trade that falls under an existing regional pact. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794641_1_20250307042023.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled a temporary rollback to steep tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico, providing some reprieve to companies and consumers after blowback on financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  After his sweeping tariffs of up to 25 percent on the two US neighbors took effect on Tuesday, stock markets tumbled, while economists warned that blanket levies could weigh on US growth and raise inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed orders Thursday to delay fresh levies for Canadian and Mexican imports covered by a North American trade agreement, though he dismissed suggestions that his decisions were linked to market turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The halt, which lasts until April 2, came one day after the White House announced similar relief for automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following talks with the "Big Three" US automakers Stellantis, Ford and General Motors, Trump decided to give a one-month exemption on autos coming through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House official told reporters that about 62 percent of Canadian imports will still face the new tariffs, although much of these are energy imports hit by a lower rate of 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of Mexican imports come through the USMCA.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest moves make conditions "much more favorable for our American car manufacturers," Trump said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added that major moves would be unveiled on April 2, the date that he has promised "reciprocal tariffs" to remedy practices Washington deems unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  At that point, Canadian and Mexican goods could still face levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president also said he would not modify broad tariffs for steel and aluminum, which are due to take effect next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office that he had a "very good conversation" with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  His remarks stood in sharp contrast to the simmering tensions with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said on Thursday that Ottawa will remain in a trade war with Washington for "the foreseeable future" even if there are "breaks for certain sectors." (AFP)

    World's sea ice cover hits record low in February

<img alt="In the Antarctic the frozen cover was 26 percent below average across February. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794625_1_20250306221837.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global sea ice cover fell to a historic low in February when the world continued to experience exceptional heat, and temperatures reached 11 degrees Celsius above average near the North Pole, Europe's climate monitor said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Copernicus Climate Change Service said last month was the third hottest February on record, continuing a run of persistent warming since 2023 stoked by greenhouse gas emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Combined Antarctic and Arctic sea ice cover – ocean water that freezes and floats on the surface – dropped to a record minimum extent of 16.04 million square kilometres on February 7, Copernicus said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "February 2025 continues the streak of record or near-record temperatures observed throughout the last two years," said Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs Copernicus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the consequences of a warmer world is melting sea ice, and the record or near-record low sea ice cover at both poles has pushed global sea ice cover to an all-time minimum."
  <br>
  <br>
  The poles are the most sensitive regions to climate change on the planet, warming several times faster than the global average.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arctic ice cover, which normally expands to its annual winter maximum in March, was a historic February low last month, eight percent below average, Copernicus said. That marked the third monthly record in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Antarctic, where it is now summer and the ice is melting, the frozen cover was 26 percent below average across February, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Antarctic region may have hit its annual low point towards the end of the month, Copernicus said, adding that if confirmed, this would be the second-lowest daily minimum coverage in the satellite record. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 EU leaders gathered with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday in Brussels in search of unity on bolstering Ukraine and Europe's defences, after US President Donald Trump upended traditional US alliances and retracted wartime backing for Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's summit brings all 27 EU leaders together for the first time since last week's explosive meeting between presidents Trump and Zelensky, with Washington since suspending military aid and intelligence sharing to help Kyiv fight Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  This has sent Ukraine's allies scrambling, with EU leaders openly questioning Washington's reliability as a security partner going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Brussels meeting will aim to cement European support for Kyiv, it is unlikely to yield any major announcements of aid beyond the 30 billion euros (US$32 billion) the bloc has already committed for this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prospect of the United States pivoting from its European partners in Nato has fuelled a growing consensus on the summit's other major topic: the need to strengthen Europe's defences against Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has laid out a plan aimed at mobilising 800 billion euros to "re-arm Europe" – largely by freeing states to spend much more – which leaders are expected to greenlight on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Europe faces a clear and present danger on a scale that none of us has seen in our adult lifetime," she wrote to leaders, urging Europe to "act as decisively as the situation dictates."
  <br>
  <br>
  France's President Emmanuel Macron doubled down in a sombre address to the nation on the summit's eve, calling for a defence spending surge to confront a "new era" and saying he would discuss extending France's nuclear deterrent to European partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Who can believe that this Russia of today will stop at Ukraine?" Macron asked. "I want to believe that the United States will stay by our side, but we have to be prepared for that not to be the case."
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, who conferred with EU chiefs in Brussels ahead of the talks, has likewise declared himself ready for "the worst-case scenario" and embraced radical reforms to ramp up Germany's defence spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstering European defences has taken on acute urgency as Trump makes clear his desire to swiftly end the three-year war through direct negotiations with Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  His embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, while expressing contempt toward Zelensky, has cemented fears that Kyiv and Europe's interests will be overlooked in any deal to end the biggest conflict on the continent since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for a "coalition of the willing" to come together to draw up a peace plan and present it to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and other European leaders made a show of embracing Zelensky and reaffirming support for Ukraine at weekend talks in London. EU chiefs will be briefing Starmer on the Brussels talks on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  France and Britain have pitched a one-month truce "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure", though not initially on the ground. Leaders are expected to raise that proposal in Brussels, but not formally decide on it.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU leaders are also expected to start thrashing out what "security guarantees" the bloc might provide for a peace deal, including the possible deployment of European troops, which several states support.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Zelensky can expect strong words of support in Brussels, it was unclear if a deal would be reached on a new package of key weaponry, with several states arguing that Europe currently has enough money committed to meet Kyiv's needs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said on Thursday that Donald Trump's threats would encourage Israel to disregard the fragile ceasefire, after the US president said that unless hostages are freed, the people of Gaza would be "DEAD".
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's warning came hours after his administration revealed it held unprecedented direct talks with Hamas, which it proscribes as a "terrorist" group, focused on American hostages in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five Americans are believed to remain among the hostages – four have been confirmed dead and one, Edan Alexander, is believed to be alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed Israel was consulted and said in a statement that it "expressed its opinion" on the direct talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said later he was "sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job" as his administration expedites billions of dollars in weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you," he wrote on his Truth Social platform after meeting freed hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also warned of repercussions for Gaza as a whole, where virtually the entire population has been displaced by Israel's relentless military campaign in response to Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim said Trump's words pushed Israel to disregard the terms of a ceasefire in place since January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation to avoid implementing its terms," Qasim said in a statement, urging the United States to pressure Israel to enter the ceasefire's second phase. (AFP)

<img alt="UK police say Zou Zhenhao used online platforms and dating apps to meet women who he invited to his home under the pretext of having drinks or studying before he drugged them. Photo: Metropolitan Police via Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794530_1_20250306130805.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A PhD student from China was found guilty on Wednesday in a London court of drugging and raping 10 women in China and the UK, as British police warned there could be more than 50 other victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zou Zhenhao, 28, was convicted of the attacks between 2019 and 2023 following a monthlong trial at the Inner London Crown Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  London's Metropolitan Police said Zou used online platforms and dating apps to meet women who he invited to his home under the pretext of having drinks or studying before he drugged them.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then filmed himself raping and sexually assaulting the women while they were unconscious, keeping some of their jewellery and clothing afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou was found guilty of 11 counts of rape, with two of the offences relating to one victim.
  <br>
  <br>
  After more than 19 hours of deliberations, jurors concluded Zou raped three of the women in London and seven in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutions relating to attacks in China were possible because foreign nationals who are living in the UK can be charged with an offence committed abroad that is also illegal in the country where it took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have only been able to identify two of the victims and said after the verdict that more than 50 other women may have fallen victim to Zou, which would make him one of the worst sex offenders in UK history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally from Dongguan in Guangdong Province, the mechanical engineering doctoral candidate at University College London claimed that the sexual interactions were consensual.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will be sentenced on June 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Rosina Cottage described the defendant as a “dangerous and predatory sexual offender” and that his sentence will be “very long.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou, who showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out in court, was also convicted of three counts of voyeurism, 10 of possession of an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and three of possession of a controlled drug with intent to commit a sexual offence, namely butanediol.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He has done all that he can in these offences to incapacitate his victims to the point where they could not resist his attack, and in many instances may not even remember what has occurred to them,” said Metropolitan Police Commander Kevin Southworth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are appealing to anyone who thinks they may have been targeted by Zou to contact them. (Agencies)

    Rare cyclone approaches Australian coast

<div class="itemFullText">
 Early wind and rain from a rare tropical cyclone began lashing part of eastern Australia on Thursday as schools were closed, public transport was stopped and desperate residents got around shortages of sandbags by buying potting mix.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred is forecast to cross the Queensland state coast somewhere between the Sunshine Coast region and the city of Gold Coast to the south early on Saturday, Bureau of Meteorology manager Matt Collopy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between the two tourist strips is the state capital Brisbane, Australia’s third-most populous city which will host the 2032 Olympic Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The wind impacts, we’re already seeing those start to develop on the exposed locations along our coast with gusts reaching 80-90 kph. We are expecting those to continue to develop,” Collopy told reporters in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfred is expected to become the first cyclone to cross the coast near Brisbane since Cyclone Zoe hit Gold Coast in 1974 and brought widespread flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyclones are common in Queensland’s tropical north but are rare in the state’s temperate and densely-populated southeast corner that borders New South Wales state. More than four million people lie in the cyclone’s path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfred was 280 kilometres east of Brisbane and moving west on Thursday with sustained winds near the centre of 95 kilometres per hour, and gusting to 130 kilometres per hour, Collopy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm is expected to maintain its wind strength before hitting land.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the greatest fears are for the expected flooding over a wide area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modelling shows that up to 20,000 homes in Brisbane, a city largely built on a river floodplain, could experience some level of flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said 660 schools in southern Queensland and 280 schools in northern New South Wales were closed on Thursday as weather conditions worsen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federal government had delivered 310,000 sandbags to Brisbane and more were on the way, Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A shortage of sandbags in Brisbane, a city of more than three million people, led some to buy sacks of potting mix as an alternative, according to Damien Effeney, a chief executive of a rural supplies business. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's Air Force on Thursday said one of its fighter jets had accidentally dropped eight bombs in the wrong place during a training exercise, resulting in civilians being injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Eight MK-82 general-purpose bombs were abnormally released from an Air Force KF-16 aircraft, landing outside the designated firing range," the Air Force said, adding it deeply regretted the incident "which resulted in civilian casualties".
  <br>
  <br>
  An official at Gyeonggi-do Bukbu Fire Services said out of the eight people who had been wounded, four were seriously hurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pocheon is about 40 kilometres northeast of Seoul and near the heavily militarised border with North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire officials suspected the munitions dropped on the town was from ongoing live-fire joint military exercises conducted by South Korea and the United States, the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photographs shared by news agency News1 that it said were from the scene showed a badly damaged house with rubble strewn on the ground next to it.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said earlier on Thursday that South Korea and US forces were holding their first joint live-fire exercises in Pocheon which were linked to annual military drills due to start next week. (Agencies)

    Briton jailed for 19 years for fighting for Ukraine

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain strongly condemned on Wednesday the sentencing of UK national James Anderson to 19 years in prison by a Russian court, which accused him of having fought for the Ukrainian army.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly condemn the sentencing of James Anderson, a British national, in a Russian court on false charges," said a spokesperson for the Foreign Office, who called on Russia to respect its obligations towards "prisoners of war".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian court press service for the city of Kursk said James Scott Rhys Anderson, 22, was found guilty of a "terrorist act" and acting as a mercenary, after he was captured while fighting in the region in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kursk court released video of Anderson being led into court in handcuffs, wearing a winter hat and jacket that appeared to be prison uniform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He nodded silently after having the sentence translated to him. He has the option to file an appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine launched its shock cross-border offensive in August, the first time a foreign army took control of Russian territory since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anderson, from the English town of Banbury, has spoken in several videos filmed by Russian officials after he was taken prisoner, saying that he went to fight for Ukraine's International Legion after being sacked from the British army.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kursk's second western district military court spent three days on Anderson's trial with the hearings held behind closed doors, the press service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said Anderson admitted guilt and decided to take part in the "armed conflict for financial reward".
  <br>
  <br>
  Anderson earlier told Russia's Izvestia newspaper he was paid US$400 a-month and about US$60 a day while on combat missions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton was told by the court he would spend the first five years of his sentence in a prison - where conditions are worse than in a penal colony. He would then be transferred to a penal colony with "strict" conditions. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued what he called a “last warning” to Hamas to release all remaining hostages held in Gaza, directing a sharply-worded message after the White House confirmed he had recently dispatched an envoy for unprecedented direct talks with the militant group.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in a statement on his Truth Social platform soon after meeting at the White House with eight former hostages, added that he was “sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,” Trump said. “Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's hawkish language came after the United States confirmed the unprecedented direct talks with Hamas, with the US envoy on hostage affairs, Adam Boehler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boehler, founder and CEO of Rubicon Founders, a healthcare investment firm, was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team during Trump’s first term that strove to win broader recognition of Israel in the Arab world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages, and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages - including Edan Alexander, an American citizen - as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha come as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains in the balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of a ceasefire ended over the weekend after six weeks of relative calm that included exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Israel has said it wants to extend the first phase until mid-April, Hamas has insisted on a transition to the second phase, which should lead to a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel has ramped up pressure, not just with threats, by halting all entry of goods and supplies into Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Britain and Germany jointly on Wednesday called the humanitarian situation in Gaza "catastrophic," and urged Israel to ensure the "unhindered" delivery of aid. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks climbed on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump pulled back on some of his tariffs temporarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move revived hope on Wall Street that Trump may avoid a worst-case trade war that grinds down economies and sends inflation higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to 5,842, to bounce back from a sell-off that had erased all of its 'Trump bump' since Election Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 1.1 percent to end at 43,006, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.5 percent to 18,552.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market turned sharply higher after Trump said he was granting a one-month exemption for US automakers on his stiff new tariffs for Mexican and Canadian imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the move after talking with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the Big Three automakers could have been hurt by such tariffs because of how much production happens across the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s announcement sent relief through Wall Street, and Ford’s and General Motors’ stock both jumped more than 5 percent to help lead a widespread rally across the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worry has been that such tariffs would not only hurt profits for companies but also jack up prices for cars and other bills for US households already struggling with still-high inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A couple reports on Wednesday gave a mixed read on the US economy. One suggested US employers pulled back sharply on their hiring last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report from payrolls processing firm, ADP, could be a warning signal ahead of the more comprehensive jobs report that’s coming Friday from the US Labor Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate report said growth for US finance, real estate and other businesses in the services sector is better than economists expected. But businesses also said in the survey they’re confronting “chaos” and uncertainty because of tariffs, according to the Institute for Supply Management. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's new military chief Eyal Zamir said his country's mission to defeat Hamas remained unfinished as he took office on Wednesday, with uncertainty hanging over the fragile Gaza ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before Zamir at a ceremony at military headquarters in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was "determined" to achieve victory in the multi-front war that began with Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came after Arab leaders endorsed a plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip under the future administration of the Palestinian Authority (PA), presenting an alternative to US President Donald Trump's widely-condemned proposal to take over the territory and displace its people.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the prospect of the PA governing Gaza remains far from certain, with Israel having ruled out any future role for the body in the territory ruled by Hamas since 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has indeed suffered a severe blow, but it has not yet been defeated. The mission is not yet accomplished," Zamir said, amid a deadlock in negotiations on the next steps in the ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zamir is replacing Herzi Halevi, who announced his resignation as armed forces chief in January over the military's shortcomings on October 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military has since released the findings of an internal investigation that acknowledged its "complete failure" to prevent the deadliest attack on Israel since its creation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas assault resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, most of them civilians, while Israel's military retaliation in Gaza has killed at least 48,405 people, also mostly civilians, data from both sides show. (AFP)

    Greenlanders shrug off Trump's takeover bid

<img alt="Locals in the capital city of Nuuk are largely unfazed by President Trump's latest remarks that he would take over Greenland. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794464_1_20250306032159.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenlanders on Wednesday shrugged off US President Donald Trump's vow to take over the Arctic island, seeing it merely as an opportunity to advance their own independence bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the quiet hallways of the University of Greenland in Nuuk, the capital of the Danish autonomous territory, Trump's latest remarks that he would take over Greenland "one way or another" left locals largely unfazed, despite his more menacing tone this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me personally, it's just something ridiculous he would say, but I wouldn't take it seriously because he's basically all talk and no action," said 23-year-old law student Peter Malik Henningsen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That sounds very violent and it's also very dumb... because Denmark, and Greenland, is also an ally of America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first major policy speech on Tuesday since returning to power, Trump underlined his expansionist vision, reiterating the importance of the United States taking over the strategically-located and mineral-rich Arctic island and taking back the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  About a quarter the size of the mainland US, Greenland's location in the Arctic puts it on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Less than a week before general elections in Greenland where independence has dominated the campaign, Trump said he had a message for the island's 57,000-strong population, whom he described as "incredible people".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he then made clear he would not give up if persuasion fails, saying: "One way or the other we're going to get it," insisting the island was needed for reasons of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump offered to buy Greenland already during his first term as president - in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the Oval Office in January, he has put the topic back on the agenda, and has this time said he wouldn't rule out military force to get it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump is like that, a bit unpredictable at times but I'm not worried," said another law student, David Jensen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're part of Nato, the United States are part of Nato, so I'm not worried," insisted the 20-year-old who hails from one of the northernmost regions of Greenland. (AFP)

    US pauses intelligence sharing with Ukraine

<img alt="The Central Intelligence Agency director John Ratcliffe describes the pause as temporary. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794449_1_20250305221949.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has "paused" intelligence sharing with Ukraine after a dramatic breakdown in relations between Kyiv and the White House, CIA director John Ratcliffe said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump and Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky had a public falling-out in the Oval Office last week, followed by Ukraine's top ally suspending crucial US military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ratcliffe confirmed that intelligence sharing had also been frozen as Ukraine seeks to beat back the Russian assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump had a real question about whether President Zelensky was committed to the peace process," Ratcliffe told Fox News.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ratcliffe said the pause "on the military front and the intelligence front" was temporary, and the United States will again "work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Tuesday that Zelensky told him Kyiv was ready for talks with Moscow and the finalisation of a US minerals deal, as Ukraine works to move on after the Oval Office spat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has sought to bring Trump back onside, posting on social media that their clash was "regrettable" and he wanted "to make things right."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his address to the US Congress later on Tuesday, Trump read aloud from a letter from Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The letter reads, 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,'" Trump told US lawmakers. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Resembling a squat, wide fridge, the world's most accurate clock went on sale for US$3.3 million in Japan on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Aether clock OC 020" is so precise that it would take 10 billion years for it to deviate by one second, according to its Kyoto-based manufacturer Shimadzu Corporation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known as a "strontium optical lattice clock", it is 100 times more accurate than caesium atomic clocks, the current standard for defining seconds, the precision-equipment producer said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The machine, a box around a metre tall, is small for its kind with a volume of around 250 litres. It can also be used in research fieldwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shimadzu is aiming to sell 10 of its clocks over the next three years and hopes its customers will use them to advance scientific research in areas such as the observation of tectonic activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Optical lattice clocks have previously been installed in Tokyo's famous Skytree, the world's tallest tower, to test the general theory of relativity, which states that "time flows more slowly in places with strong gravity." (AFP)

    Rain offers hope in Japan's worst wildfire in 50 years

<img alt="The wildfire broke out on February 26, and firefighting efforts including Japan Self-Defense Forces, have continued while thousands have evacuated their homes. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794373_1_20250305144046.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wet weather looked poised to offer relief Wednesday as Japan battled its worst wildfire in half a century in a northern region hit by record-low rainfall.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blaze around the northern city of Ofunato has killed one person and forced nearly 4,000 to evacuate their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has engulfed around 2,900 hectares -- over eight times the area of New York City's Central Park -- making it Japan's largest wildfire since at least 1975, when 2,700 hectares burnt in Kushiro on Hokkaido.
  <br>
  <br>
  But rain and snow were falling Wednesday as several columns of white smoke billowed from a mountain where the blaze has been raging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Firefighters have been working on the ground through the night to extinguish the fire," a city official said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are hoping that snow, which started to fall this morning, will help," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 84 buildings are believed to have been damaged, although details are still being assessed, according to the fire agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of late Tuesday, almost 4,000 people living nearby had complied with orders to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan endured its hottest summer on record last year, as climate change pushes up temperatures worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of wildfires in the country has declined since its 1970s peak, but there were about 1,300 in 2023, concentrated in the period from February to April when the air dries out and winds pick up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese baseball prodigy Roki Sasaki, who recently joined the Los Angeles Dodgers, has offered a 10-million-yen (US$67,000) donation and 500 sets of bedding to people affected by the wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki was a high school student there, after losing his father and grandparents in the huge 2011 tsunami. (AFP)

    Democrat lawmaker ejected during Trump's speech

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Democrats protested President Donald Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday with signs reading "No King!" and "Save Medicaid," with some turning their backs on the Republican as he spoke and one lawmaker marched out by security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Representative Al Green of Texas, a Democrat who plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump, loudly interrupted the speech in its first minutes by shouting that Trump did not have a mandate to cut safety net programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans are trying to pass a spending bill that could significantly slash spending on popular social programs, including the Medicaid health insurance plan for low-income people, to pay for Trump's desired tax cut plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered the sergeant-at-arms to remove Green from the chamber, and Republicans cheered as Green relented - waving his cane in the air - and was led out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green told reporters afterward, "It's worth it to let people know that there are some of us who are going to stand up against this president's desire to cut Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Republicans holding majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate, any impeachment effort against Trump is unlikely to advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around a third of the Democrats' side of the chamber had emptied as Trump's address crossed the threshold to become the longest such speech on record at an hour and 30 minutes. The rest quickly departed as Republicans gave Trump a standing ovation when the speech ended after 100 minutes, the longest in Congressional history. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump took a victory lap in a speech to Congress on Tuesday, exulting in a series of dramatic actions that have upended American foreign policy, ignited a trade war with close allies and slashed the federal workforce since he took office six weeks ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  "To my fellow citizens, America is back," Trump began to a standing ovation from fellow Republicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplish in four years or eight years -- and we are just getting started," Trump said to frequent chants from loyal lawmakers of "USA, USA!"
  <br>
  <br>
  "The American Dream is surging -- bigger and better than ever before. The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again."
  <br>
  <br>
  The primetime speech, his first to Congress since taking office on January 20, capped a second day of market turmoil after he imposed sweeping new tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump spoke in the House of Representatives, where lawmakers huddled in fear for their lives a little over four years ago while a mob of Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory over the then-incumbent Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president called his first few weeks in office "the most successful" first month of any US presidency in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also defended his tariff campaign, despite concerns that it could raise consumer prices and slow economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whatever they tariff us, we tariff them. Whatever they tax us, we tax them," Trump said.

  <br>
  "If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market."
  <br>
  <br>
  World leaders were watching Trump's speech closely, a day after he paused all military aid to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension followed an Oval Office blowup in which Trump angrily upbraided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in front of TV cameras.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pause in aid threatened Kyiv's efforts to defend against Russia, and further rattled European leaders worried that Trump is moving the US too far toward Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, two of the country's closest allies, and an additional 10 percent on Chinese imports deepened investor concerns about the economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arab leaders on Tuesday endorsed Egypt's postwar plan for Gaza that would allow its roughly two million Palestinians to remain, in a counterproposal to US President Donald Trump’s plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$53 billion plan's endorsement by Arab leaders at a summit in Cairo amounted to a rejection of Trump’s proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The summit conclusions were welcomed by Hamas, rejected by Israel and given a lukewarm response by the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi expressed his appreciation for “the consensus among the Arab countries to support the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, which allows the Palestinian People to stay on their land without displacement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In a social media post after the summit, el-Sissi said he looked forward to working with Trump, other Arab nations and the international community “to adopt a plan that aims for a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian Issue, ends the root causes of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, guarantees the security and stability of the peoples of the region and establishes the Palestinian State."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House welcomed input from Arab nations, but insisted Hamas could not remain in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  “President Trump has been clear that Hamas cannot continue to govern Gaza,” White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “While the President stands by his bold vision for a post-war Gaza, he welcomes input from our Arab partners in the region. It’s clear his proposals have driven the region to come to the table rather than allow this issue to devolve into further crisis.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas welcomed the summit’s outcome, saying it marked a new phase of Arab and Islamic alignment with the Palestinian cause and that it valued Arab leaders’ rejection of attempts to transfer Palestinians from their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative US proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting. (AP)

    'China GDP could be affected by US tariffs'

<img alt="A finance expert says the Chinese response is very firm and shows determination to the US. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794282_1_20250305085101.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Wednesday said that the latest round of US tariffs on Chinese imports could gradually reduce China's gross domestic product by some 0.3 to 0.4 percent over a 12-month period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as US President Donald Trump slapped an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese goods entering the US. That prompted Beijing to retaliate, including a tariff on US agricultural products, export restrictions on select companies and a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Xia, Chief Economist for Asia at BBVA Research, said Beijing's measures were "measured and calibrated".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that the Chinese response is very firm and shows determination to the US," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, if you look at the coverage of all these agricultural products, I think in total it's a kind of maybe around 20 percent of the total US imports, so that means the Chinese response is still measured – it leaves the room for the negotiations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also said he was not optimistic that both sides could reach a deal in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump, he's too busy, he has so many things on his agenda, like the Ukraine crisis, and imposing tariffs on other partners like Canada and Mexico,“ he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday angrily denounced Trump's "dumb" tariffs and accused the US president of seeking to collapse Canada's economy in order to annex its northern neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's US correspondent Simon Marks said there is currently a "massive" rift between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We heard Trudeau using language about the United States and its government that we have never heard in the past from any previous Canadian leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Marks said there are signs there could be a possible breakthrough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have heard from the United States commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who is a very close advisor to president Donald Trump, that there could be a climb-down coming by the US government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lutnick said there has been an enormous amount of phone conversations between Canadian and Mexican officials and the United States, according to Marks. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<img alt='In his first public comments since Trump halted US military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky said his public bust-up with Trump last week was "regrettable". Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794263_1_20250305061826.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said he wanted to "make things right" with Donald Trump and work under the US president's "strong leadership" to secure a lasting peace in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his first public comments since Trump halted US military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky said his public bust-up with Trump last week was "regrettable" and pledged to sign a key minerals deal with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for a "truce" in the sea and sky as a first step to ending the three-year war with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic collapse in the Kyiv-Washington wartime alliance has played out in the open since a televised dispute between Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office last week, mounting as Ukraine's top ally suspended crucial military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts," Zelensky wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be," the Ukrainian leader added. "It is time to make things right."
  <br>
  <br>
  He told Ukrainians in his regular evening address he had instructed his defence and intelligence chiefs to contact their US counterparts to "get official information" on the aid freeze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's stunning decision Monday to halt assistance to Ukraine deepened fears in Kyiv and many European capitals that America was pivoting away from its allies -- and towards Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow hailed Trump's decision, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling it a "solution which could really push the Kyiv regime to a peace process".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union, which -- along with Ukraine -- is excluded from US-Russian negotiations towards a potential truce, has been scrambling to bolster support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron praised Zelensky for his willingness to "re-engage in dialogue" with Trump, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Europe is fearing for the future of US-European defence cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen presented an EU plan to mobilise some 800 billion euros (US$840 billion) for Europe's defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany's likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, meanwhile said he would support the immediate approval of a three-billion-euro Ukraine aid package held up in parliament, calling it "urgent".
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU on Thursday is to hold an emergency summit aimed at cementing joint European support for Ukraine. (AFP)

    CK Hutchison to sell Panama unit after Trump pressure

<img alt="The sale to a BlackRock consortium will deliver cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion to Hong Kong's CK Hutchison. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794251_1_20250305042524.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's CK Hutchison on Tuesday agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, following intense pressure from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$22.8 billion sale, which also includes dozens of ports in other countries, appeared to be a win for Trump's aggressive diplomacy just hours before he is due to tout the successes of the first six tumultuous weeks of his second term in an address to the US Congress. Trump had refused to rule out military action to assert US control over the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has complained about the presence of mainland Chinese and Hong Kong-based companies in Panama, while US officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison's control of ports at both entrances of the canal represents a security risk for the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of licenses will result in the consortium gaining a 90 percent stake in Panama Ports Company, which has been the operator of the Balboa and Cristobal ports in the Central American country for more than two decades, CK Hutchison said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock has briefed the White House and Congressional leadership on the deal, a person familiar with the transaction said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would be BlackRock's largest infrastructure investment to date, that person said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department, White House, National Security Council and Panama's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's authorities have announced an audit of CK Hutchison's contract, saying they are investigating its compliance with concession agreements. Panama's attorney general determined earlier this month that CK Hutchison's port contract was "unconstitutional." The Supreme Court was to have had the last word on its legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made his first overseas trip as top US diplomat to Latin America last month, including to Panama, where he pressured the country over China's presence along the canal. After his departure, Rubio hailed Panama's decision to exit China's Belt and Road infrastructure plan, and he has expressed optimism in media interviews that Hutchison would not own the ports in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of Panama ports licenses held by the unit of billionaire Li Ka-shing's conglomerate to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment will give it control of an 80 percent interest in Hutchison Ports for an equity value of US$14.21 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will get control of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries while delivering cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion for the Hong Kong-based consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale does not involve any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, as well as South China, or any other ports in mainland China, CK Hutchison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consortium has agreed that negotiations will be on an exclusive basis for a period of 145 days, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock completed the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for approximately US$12.5 billion in cash and stock last October. At the time, chairman and CEO Larry Fink described infrastructure as “a generational investment opportunity.” (Reuters)

    EU chief unveils US$840 billion 'rearm' plan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday presented a five-part plan to mobilise some US$844 billion for Europe's defence, and help provide "immediate" military support for Ukraine after Washington suspended military aid.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move came hours after US President Donald Trump announced the aid freeze, intensifying Washington's push for a peace deal with Russia and confirming its pivot away from its European allies and partners in backing Kyiv's war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new era is upon us," the European Commission president said in a letter presenting the plan to EU leaders, two days before a summit aimed at cementing joint action on support for Ukraine and boosting Europe's defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Rearm Europe' could mobilise close to US$844 billion of defence expenditures for a safe and resilient Europe," von der Leyen told reporters as she outlined the plan, which includes a US$158 billion loan facility along with steps to free up large-scale defence investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear how fast funds could be made available under the proposals, which need approval by member states, nor how quickly this could translate into battlefield support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  It proposes that the EU ease strict budget rules, which oblige states to keep public deficits below three percent of gross domestic product, to allow them to ramp up spending on defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondly, the plan calls for a new "instrument" to provide US$157 billion of loans to member states for defence investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are talking about pan-European capability domains - for example, air and missile defence, artillery systems, missiles and ammunition drones and anti-drone systems," said von der Leyen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's Brussels summit, after weekend crisis talks also involving Britain and Nato, comes as Europe contemplates the prospect of the United States withdrawing longer-term support from Ukraine and more broadly from its European allies. (AFP)

    China to 'fight to the end' against US tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 China vowed on Tuesday to fight to the "bitter end" if the United States pushes a trade war, after Washington and Beijing exchanged a salvo of tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing up to 15 percent increases to import levies covering a range of American agricultural and food products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also placed 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's countermeasures are to protect its own rights and interests, Lin told a regular press conference, urging Washington to return to dialogue and cooperation as soon as possible. (Agencies)

 Canada will slap tariffs on US imports beginning on Tuesday in response to levies pledged by President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday, adding "there is no justification" for Washington's actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12.01am EST tomorrow, respond with 25 percent tariffs against US$155 billion of American goods," the Canadian prime minister said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steep US tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods came into effect Tuesday as a deadline to avert President Donald Trump's levies passed without the North American neighbours striking a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian goods will face a 25 percent tariff -- with energy resources hit by a lower 10 percent rate -- while Mexican products face a 25 percent blanket levy, according to orders Trump previously signed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a lack of progress in tackling drug trafficking as he pushed ahead with the duties. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump has paused military aid to Ukraine following his clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official said, deepening the fissure that has opened between the two one-time allies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move comes after Trump upended US policy on Ukraine and Russia upon taking office in January, adopting a more conciliatory stance towards Moscow - and after an explosive confrontation with Zelensky at the White House on Friday in which Trump criticiSed him for being insufficiently grateful for Washington's support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution," said a White House official.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House had no immediate comment on the scope and amount of aid affected or how long the pause would last.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pentagon could not provide further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment nor did the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Trump again said Zelensky should be more appreciative of American support after earlier responding angrily to an Associated Press report quoting Zelensky as saying the end of the war is "very, very far away."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer!" Trump wrote on Truth Social. (Reuters)

    SpaceX calls off Starship test flight at last minute

<img alt="The latest test flight was to include another attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower's " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794109_1_20250304101337.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's SpaceX called off the latest test flight of its Starship rocket just before its scheduled launch on Monday, citing an unspecified problem with the behemoth spacecraft.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Standing down from today's flight test attempt," SpaceX posted on X, also owned by Musk. "Starship team is determining the next best available opportunity to fly."
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest and most powerful rocket was set to take off with no crew at 6:45pm local time from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rescheduled launch has yet to be announced, though SpaceX employee Dan Huot said it was expected "to be about 24 hours" during a live feed of the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight will be Starship's eighth orbital mission overall and first since a dramatic mid-air explosion over the Caribbean during its last trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standing 123 metres tall, Starship is designed to eventually be fully reusable and plays a crucial role in Musk and SpaceX's vision of colonising Mars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Nasa is awaiting a modified version of the rocket for its Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Federal Aviation Administration grounded Starship after its previous flight on January 16 ended with the upper stage disintegrating in a fiery cascade over the Turks and Caicos Islands, prompting clean-up efforts for fallen debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the upcoming flight, SpaceX says it has introduced numerous upgrades to the upper-stage spacecraft, enhancing its reliability and performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission, expected to last just over an hour, includes another attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower's "chopstick" arms – a feat SpaceX has successfully executed twice, including in the last flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the first commercial mission of Europe's new heavy-lift rocket Ariane 6 was called off minutes before it was scheduled to launch, due to an "anomaly" on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest of several postponements for the rocket as Europe seeks to secure independent access to space. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new round of negotiations for an international treaty on reducing global plastics pollution will be held in Geneva in August, the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A previous round of negotiations – tasked with hammering out a legally binding treaty – ended without agreement in South Korea last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trenches, and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on the Unep website of the new talks comes in the wake of a last-ditch Cop16 finance deal on biodiversity agreed in Rome last week by delegates from some 150 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unep said the new plastics talks will be held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva from August 5 to 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  December's South Korea talks broke down following opposition from a bloc of mainly oil-producing countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from nearly 200 nations debated for a week on how to stop millions of tonnes of plastic waste from entering the environment each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks were meant to end with the world's first accord on cutting plastics pollution after nearly two years of discussions, but concluded without an agreement – except to extend talks. (AFP)

    Study paints grim picture of obesity

<img alt="Researchers estimate that 3.8 billion adults will be overweight or obese in 15 years. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794096_1_20250304090417.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 60 percent of all adults and a third of all children in the world will be overweight or obese by 2050 unless governments take action, a large new study said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The research published in the Lancet medical journal used data from 204 countries to paint a grim picture of what it described as one of the great health challenges of the century.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure," lead author Emmanuela Gakidou, from the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of overweight or obese people worldwide rose from 929 million in 1990 to 2.6 billion in 2021, the study found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without a serious change, the researchers estimate that 3.8 billion adults will be overweight or obese in 15 years - or around 60 percent of the global adult population in 2050.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's health systems will come under crippling pressure, the researchers warned, with around a quarter of the world's obese expected to be aged over 65 by that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also predicted a 121-percent increase in obesity among children and adolescents around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third of all obese young people will be living in two regions - North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America and the Caribbean - by 2050, the researchers warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is not too late to act, said study co-author Jessica Kerr from Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Much stronger political commitment is needed to transform diets within sustainable global food systems," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That commitment was also needed for strategies "that improve people's nutrition, physical activity and living environments, whether it's too much processed food or not enough parks," Kerr said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than half the world's overweight or obese adults already live in just eight countries - China, India, the United States, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Indonesia and Egypt, the study said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The research is based on figures from the Global Burden of Disease study from the IHME, which brings together thousands of researchers across the world and is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (AFP)

    Tariffs to go ahead on Mexican and Canadian imports

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Monday that 25 percent taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada would start on Tuesday, sparking renewed fears of a North American trade war that already showed signs of pushing up inflation and hindering growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  “Tomorrow - tariffs 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico. And that’ll start,” Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room. “They’re going to have to have a tariff.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has said the tariffs are to force the two US neighbours to step up their fight against fentanyl trafficking and stop illegal immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump has also indicated that he wants to eliminate the Americas' trade imbalances as well and push more factories to relocate in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments quickly rattled the US stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the Trump administration remains confident that tariffs are the best choice to boost US manufacturing and attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump provided a one-month delay in February as both Mexico and Canada promised concessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said that there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to avoid the steep new tariffs, which were also set to tax Canadian energy products, such as oil and electricity, at a lower 10 per cent rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If Trump is imposing tariffs, we are ready," said Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joly said Canada had a very strong border plan and explained that to Trump administration officials last week. She said diplomatic efforts were continuing. She spoke after Trump made his comments on Tuesday. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A car driven into a crowd in the German city of Mannheim on Monday killed one person and injured several, police said, adding that one person had been arrested.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We can now confirm that a car was driven into a pedestrian zone and that one person was killed," said police spokesman Stefan Wilhelm, adding that several people were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that one suspect was arrested," he said, adding that "the investigation is continuing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilhelm said residents had been urged "to avoid the inner city area" after the emergency sparked a large-scale police operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police with heavy weapons cordoned off the area and police helicopters were seen in the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  A reporter for news channel NTV reported that "at least one person is lying covered under a tarpaulin".
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany has in recent months suffered a spate of violent attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month a man drove a car into a trade union demonstration in the southern city of Munich, killing a two-year-old girl and her mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December a car-ramming attack targeted a Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg, killing six people and wounding hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mannheim itself was the scene of a stabbing attack at an anti-Islam rally last May in which a policeman was killed and five others were wounded. (AFP)

    Haifa attacker was Israeli Druze minority

<img alt="Members of Israeli security and emergency services transport the body of the reported attacker in Haifa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794029_1_20250303192453.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's police said the perpetrator of a stabbing attack in the northern city of Haifa on Monday was a member of Israel's Druze Arab minority who recently returned from abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Druze are an ethno-religious minority among the Arab citizens of Israel, who's roots in the region go back centuries. They make up roughly 5.5 percent of Lebanon's population, 3 percent of Syria and 1.6 percent of Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came one day after Israel blocked aid to the Gaza Strip during an impasse over extending the truce in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, a prominent Druze leader in Lebanon said on Sunday that he will soon visit Syria to meet its interim leader as tensions simmer between members of the minority group, the war-torn country’s interim government, and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The free Syrians must be cautious of the plots of Israel,” veteran Druze leader Walid Jumblatt said at a news conference Sunday, accusing Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of creating sectarian division and chaos in the country. “In Syria there is a plot for sabotage. There is a plot for sabotage in the region and for the Arabs’ national security.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-week first phase of the truce ended at the weekend. It had enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance to Gaza. The Israeli decision prompted the United Nations to call on Israel for an immediate restoration of the aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany also urged Israel to resume aid flow "immediately".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel's army said it struck on Monday a "suspicious motorised vessel" off the coast of south Gaza's Khan Yunis. (Agencies)

 "Anora", the story of a sex worker who gets a chance at a new life when she marries a wealthy client on a whim, won five Academy Awards on Sunday, including the coveted best picture Oscar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The movie's 25-year-old star, Mikey Madison, was named best actress. The film also won best director for Sean Baker and trophies for original screenplay and editing.

   “Anora” creator Sean Baker won best director, best picture and two other Academy Awards at the Oscars on Sunday, bookending a dominant awards season for the American filmmaker whose stories seek to humanise sex workers and immigrants.

   Baker, 53, wrote, produced, directed and edited the film, and he swept in all four categories.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Sunday blocked aid flowing into Gaza, where a six-week truce enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance, prompting the UN to call for an immediate restoration of humanitarian assistance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli decision came as talks on a truce extension appeared to hit an impasse, after the ceasefire's 42-day first phase drew to a close.
  <br>
  <br>
  Truce mediators Egypt and Qatar accused Israel of blatantly violating the ceasefire deal by halting the aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Sunday, Israel had announced a truce extension until mid-April that it said United States Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hamas has repeatedly rejected an extension, instead favouring a transition to the truce deal's second phase that could bring a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With uncertainty looming over the truce, both Israel and Palestinian sources reported Israeli military strikes in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, whose health ministry reported at least four people killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the fighting, said the "decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the [ceasefire] agreement".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as "a weapon against the Palestinian people", comments echoed by Qatar which said it "strongly condemns" Israel's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, which has rejected any talk of normalising ties with Israel without a Palestinian state, condemned the aid block as "a tool of blackmail and collective punishment".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan said Israel's action "threatens to reignite" fighting in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres called for "humanitarian aid to flow back into Gaza immediately".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union condemned what it called Hamas's refusal to accept the extension of the first phase, and added that Israel's subsequent aid block "risked humanitarian consequences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels called for "a rapid resumption of negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire". (AFP)

<img alt="Leaders gather at Lancaster House in London to discuss European security and Ukraine. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793931_1_20250303083142.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European leaders closed ranks on Sunday in support of Kyiv at a London summit, where they pledged to spend more on security and assemble a coalition to defend any truce in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  And French President Emmanuel Macron, flying back from the summit, said in a newspaper interview that France and Britain wanted to propose a partial one-month truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks, which brought together 18 allies, came just two days after US President Donald Trump berated his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in front of reporters at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Britain, France "and others" would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, which they would then put to Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London meeting came at a delicate moment for war-battered Ukraine, facing uncertain US backing and on the back foot against Russia's three-year war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's row with Zelensky also raised fresh questions over the US commitment to Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said Europe found itself "at a crossroads in history".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a moment for more talk - it's time to act. It's time to step up and lead and unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  With no guarantee of US involvement, "Europe must do the heavy lifting", Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several countries were ready to help defend any truce, he added - without naming them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron, in an interview with France's Le Figaro newspaper, said he and Starmer were working on a one-month truce in Ukraine, "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was warmly embraced by many of the world leaders at the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the UK leader's Downing Street home, people gathered to show their support for Ukraine, some dressed in the country's blue and yellow national colours. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The ministry of health in Hamas-run Gaza said four people were killed and six others wounded in Israeli attacks on Sunday after the first phase of a fragile truce in the territory drew to a close.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Since this morning, four dead and six wounded" have been brought to "hospitals in the Gaza Strip following Israeli attacks in various parts of the territory", the ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said that it struck suspects planting an "explosive device" in northern Gaza as the first phase of a fragile ceasefire with Hamas ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross called on Israel and Hamas to maintain their ceasefire in Gaza to prevent the conflict-weary region from sinking back into despair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire agreement has saved countless lives and offered a beacon of hope amid unimaginable suffering. Any unravelling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair," it said in a statement, adding the truce was "essential."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement came as Israel said it was suspending the entry of supplies into Gaza and as deadly attacks were reported in the territory after Israel and Hamas hit an impasse of how to proceed further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty urged on Sunday the "full implementation" of the Gaza ceasefire deal, calling on the European Union to pressure Israel to enforce it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no alternative to the faithful and full implementation by all parties of what was signed last January," Abdelatty said at a press conference in Cairo, urging the EU to exert "maximum pressure on the parties, especially the Israeli party, regarding commitment to the ceasefire agreement". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, hospitalised for more than two weeks with double pneumonia, on Sunday thanked believers around the world for their "support" and "affection" as he missed delivering a third straight Angelus prayer in person.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff, who has been treated at the Gemelli hospital in Rome since February 14, missed the traditional weekly prayer, which instead was published in the form of a letter the Vatican released at noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank you for the prayers, which rise up to the Lord from the hearts of so many faithful from many parts of the world. I feel all your affection and closeness and, at this particular time, I feel as if I am 'carried' and supported by all God's people. Thank you all," wrote the Argentine pontiff.
  <br>
  <br>
  He concluded by calling for peace in addressing conflicts around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I pray above all for peace. From here, war appears even more absurd. Let us pray for tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan and Kivu," the pope wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Vatican, the pope spent "a calm night".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope is still resting," the Holy See said earlier in its latest health update on the head of the Catholic Church.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday evening, it had said the pope's condition was "stable", adding that he was still receiving oxygen, had no fever, had been eating, was alert and praying. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain and France will work with Ukraine on a plan to end the fighting with Russia, which will later be presented to the United States, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The United Kingdom, along with France and possibly one or two others, will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, and then we'll discuss that plan with the United States," Starmer told British media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer hosted Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders on Sunday for a summit on the conflict, which has taken on huge significance in the wake of the clash between the Ukrainian president and US counterpart Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said "nobody wants to see" the scenes of the two leaders' White House clash, and that "I am clear in my mind that he (Trump) does want a lasting peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister has presented himself as a bridge between the United States and Europe, and met with Trump in Washington on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to find a way that we can all work together. Because, in the end, we've had three years of bloody conflict. Now we need to get to that lasting peace," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a risk that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will come again if he's given the opportunity to do so..., which is why I've been so centrally focused on what a guarantee is. How do we defend the line if a line is agreed," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Where that physical line would be is "a subject for discussion", said Starmer. (AFP)

 Firefly Aerospace became the second US company to land on the moon on Sunday with its debut Blue Ghost lander, kicking off a two-week research mission as one of a handful of private firms to reach the frontlines of a global moon race.
 <br>
  <br>
  The size of a compact car, the four-legged Blue Ghost carried 10 scientific payloads as it touched down near an ancient volcanic vent on Mare Crisium, a large basin in the northeast corner of the moon's Earth-facing side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flight controllers at Firefly's Austin, Texas headquarters watched as Blue Ghost descended toward the moon's surface at a gentle two miles per hour, confirming on a live stream that the spacecraft had entered lunar gravity.

  "We're on the moon," declared Will Coogan, Blue Ghost Chief Engineer at Firefly Aerospace, from mission control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefly became the second private firm to score a soft moon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Houston-based Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lander made a lopsided soft touchdown last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five nations have made successful soft landings in the past - the then-Soviet Union, the US, China, India and, last year, Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every single thing was clockwork, even when we landed, and then after, we saw everything was stable and upright," Firefly CEO Jason Kim said on stage at a company watch event in Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the audience were hundreds of Firefly employees, space industry officials and senior Nasa leaders, including the agency's acting administrator Janet Petro.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moonshot by Firefly, an upstart primarily building rockets, is one of three lunar missions actively in progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's ispace launched its second lander on the same rocket as Firefly's in January, before Intuitive Machines embarked on its second lunar mission on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two navigation cameras onboard Blue Ghost were used to spot hazards on the lunar surface during its final descent, helping the spacecraft steer toward an ideal landing spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impact sensors on the craft's four carbon-composite legs triggered Blue Ghost's engine to shutdown upon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two solar panels on the side and one of the top will power the lander and its research instruments for a 14-day mission on the moon, before the frigid lunar night brings temperatures as low as minus minus 173 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  Backed by Nasa and its flagship Artemis moon programme, private companies are playing an outsized role in the modern moon race with the hopes of stimulating a lunar market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are building landers to put US astronauts on the moon as soon as 2027 for the first time since 1972. (Reuters)

    Israel suspends entry of supplies into Gaza

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Sunday slammed Israel's suspension of supplies and aid entering Gaza, describing it as a "war crime" and a violation of the ceasefire agreement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's "decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the (ceasefire) agreement", the group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced earlier on Sunday that it was suspending the entry of supplies into Gaza, and threatened "consequences" for Hamas if it did not accept a proposal for a temporary extension of the truce in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided that, from this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be suspended," his office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel will not accept a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas persists with its refusal, there will be other consequences."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance, expired on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas was to release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout and a lasting ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said earlier on Sunday that it supported a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, or April 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the proposal came from the Trump administration's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 American singer Angie Stone, who was nominated for three Grammy Awards, died at 63 early on Saturday, a representative confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deborah R. Champagne, Stone's representative who last spoke with her shortly after 9 pm ET, said Stone died in a car accident in Montgomery, Alabama, following a performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guy Todd Williams, better known as Rahiem from the Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, which was the first rap group inducted into the Rock Hall, said nine other passengers were in a van with Stone during the accident. He said she was the only fatality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stone, a native of South Carolina, was a member of female hip-hop trio The Sequence. The group's most popular song, Funk You Up, peaked at 15 on Billboard's Hot Soul Singles. Rolling Stone described it as the first rap hit performed by women.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group was signed to the now defunct Sugar Hill Records, a label under of Warner Music Group, which also represented Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, among other artists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stone released her debut solo album, Black Diamond, in 1999. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America the following year. Her highest charting album -"The Art of Love & War" released in 2007- peaked at 11 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside of music, she acted in several films with her debut being "The Hot Chick" alongside Rob Schneider and Rachel McAdams. Stone also starred in "The Fighting Temptations" with Beyonce and Cuba Gooding Jr. (Reuters)

    Zelensky gets warm welcome in UK after Trump clash

<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday gave Volodymyr Zelensky a warm welcome in London, a day after the Ukrainian leader's clash with US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  And ahead of Sunday's summit in London to discuss how to support Ukraine as it battles Russia's forces, Starmer reiterated his support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In partnership with our allies, we must intensify our preparations for the European element of security guarantees alongside continued discussions with the United States," he said in a statement issued late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security, and secure our collective future," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours earlier, Ukraine and the UK unveiled a £2.26 billion (US$2.84 billion) loan agreement to support Ukraine's defence capabilities, to be paid back with the profits of immobilised sovereign Russian assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The funds will be directed toward weapons production in Ukraine," Zelensky said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is true justice -- the one who started the war must be the one to pay."
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters cheered as Zelensky's convoy swept into Downing Street, where he was embraced by Starmer and posed for photographs before heading inside the British leader's home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You're very, very welcome here in Downing Street," Starmer told Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom, for such big support from the very beginning of this war," Zelensky responded.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is due to meet King Charles III on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders met behind closed doors for around 75 minutes, and embraced again as Starmer escorted Zelensky to his car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier Saturday Zelensky had stressed that Trump's support was still "crucial" for Ukraine despite their row the previous day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash was a further shock to Kyiv's European allies, still adjusting to Washington's new stance on the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday as cameras in the Oval Office rolled, Trump berated Zelensky for not being "ready" for peace with Russia, triggering alarm across Europe. (AFP)

    Delhi bans old cars from refuelling to help curb smog

<img alt="At the peak of the smog, levels of PM2.5 pollutants have surged to more than 60 times the World Health Organisation's recommended daily maximum. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793825_1_20250301215153.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cars more than 15 years old will soon be barred from refuelling in New Delhi, the city's government said on Saturday, as part of measures to reduce the Indian capital's hazardous pollution levels.
 <br>
  <br>
  New Delhi is regularly ranked as one of the most polluted cities in the world and is blanketed in acrid smog each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pollution is primarily blamed on agricultural burning by nearby farmers to clear their fields for ploughing, as well as factories and traffic fumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds worsen the situation by trapping deadly pollutants each winter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diesel and petrol cars older than 10 and 15 years, respectively, are not allowed to ply on Delhi roads, but many have been found flouting the rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi's environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa told reporters on Saturday that the decision to stop fuel for the old cars was made at a "marathon meeting" on air pollution to "find out the diseases and its remedies."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have decided to stop giving fuel to vehicles more than 15 years old after March 31, 2025," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said "gadgets" would be installed at petrol pumps to identify such vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sirsa said other decisions taken include turning barren land into "new forests" and getting university students involved in planting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government would make it mandatory for high rises, hotels and Delhi airport to install anti-smog guns and gadgets to control pollution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public health crisis has grown steadily worse over the years, and weeks-long school closures across the capital, aimed at shielding vulnerable children from the harmful air, are now an annual occurrence.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the peak of the smog, levels of PM2.5 pollutants – dangerous cancer-causing microparticles small enough to enter the bloodstream through the lungs – surged to more than 60 times the World Health Organisation's recommended daily maximum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Piecemeal government initiatives, such as partial restrictions on fossil fuel-powered transport and water trucks spraying mist to clear particulate matter from the air, have failed to make a noticeable impact. (AFP)

    Hamas says 'no progress' on second phase of ceasefire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The latest round of talks on the second phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has made no progress so far, and it was unclear whether the talks would resume on Saturday, a senior Hamas official said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the ceasefire, which paused 15 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phase one expires on Saturday, but under the terms of the deal, fighting is not to resume while negotiations are underway on the second phase, which could end the war in Gaza and see the remaining living hostages returned home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials from Israel, Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been involved in negotiations on the second phase in Cairo, with the goal of bringing an end to the war with the return of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas did not attend the talks, but its position has been represented through Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said there had been “no progress” on finding a solution before Israeli negotiators returned home on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was unclear whether those mediators were going to return to Cairo to resume talks on Saturday as has been expected, and Naim said he had “no idea” when negotiations might start again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas started the war with its October 7 2023, attack that left 1,200 dead in Israel. Since then, Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say that more than half the dead have been women and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides agreed to the three-phase ceasefire deal in January, with the aim of bringing an end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Hamas said that it “reaffirms its full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details” and called on the international community to pressure Israel to “immediately proceed to the second phase without any delay or evasion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to phase two of the ceasefire, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that mediators in the talks were “also discussing ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the population and support stability in the region.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has rejected an Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire’s first phase by 42 days, saying it goes against the truce agreement, according to a member of the group who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli proposal calls for extending the ceasefire through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which started on Saturday, in return for an additional hostage exchange, the Hamas member said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN food agency, the World Food Programme, said in a post on social media on Saturday that it reached 1 million Palestinians across Gaza during the deal’s first phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pause in fighting helped “restoring distribution points, reopening bakeries, and expanding cash assistance,” the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The ceasefire must hold,” it said. “There can be no going back.” (AP)

    PKK declares ceasefire with Turkey after 40 years

<img alt="Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has described PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's appeal as an " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793814_1_20250301193855.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Outlawed Kurdish militants on Saturday declared a ceasefire with Turkey following a landmark call by jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan asking the group to disband.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the first reaction from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) after Ocalan this week called for the dissolution of the group and asked it to lay down arms after fighting the Turkish state for over four decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to pave the way for the implementation of leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society, we are declaring a ceasefire effective from today," the PKK executive committee said, referring to Ocalan and quoted by the pro-PKK ANF news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agree with the content of the call as it is, and we say that we will follow and implement it," the committee based in northern Iraq said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency since 1984 with the aim of carving out a homeland for Kurds, who account for around 20 percent of Turkey's 85 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Ocalan was jailed in 1999, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has cost more than 40,000 lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  After several meetings with Ocalan at his island prison, the pro-Kurdish DEM party on Thursday relayed his appeal for PKK to lay down its weapons and convene a congress to announce the organisation's dissolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK said on Saturday it was ready to convene a congress as Ocalan wanted, but "for this to happen, a suitable secure environment must be created" and Ocalan "must personally direct and lead it for the success of the congress."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group also said Ocalan's prison conditions must be eased, adding he "must be able to live and work in physical freedom and be able to establish unhindered relationships with anyone he wants, including his friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the last round of peace talks collapsed in 2015, no further contact was made until October, when a hardline nationalist ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered a surprise peace gesture if Ocalan rejected violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Erdogan backed the rapprochement, his government cranked up pressure on the opposition, arresting hundreds of politicians, activists and journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erdogan on Friday said Ocalan's appeal was a "historic opportunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Turkey would "keep a close watch" to make sure the talks to end the insurgency were "brought to a successful conclusion."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the pressure of terrorism and arms is eliminated, the space for politics in democracy will naturally expand," Erdogan promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iraq has welcomed Ocalan's call, saying it was "a positive and important step towards achieving stability in the region."
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK's presence in Iraq has been a recurrent source of tension between Baghdad and Ankara.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group holds positions in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, where Turkey also maintains military bases and often carries out ground and air operations against the Kurdish militants. (AFP)

 Pope Francis, hospitalised for two weeks with pneumonia in both lungs, spent a peaceful night after suffering a breathing crisis, the Vatican said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The pope spent a peaceful night and is resting," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff was put on a ventilator because of an "isolated" breathing crisis on Friday, the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His doctors said it would take the next 24 to 48 hours to see if this breathing trouble has worsened his condition or not, a Vatican source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff is "not out of danger" but was "in good spirits," the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis was hospitalised on February 14 with bronchitis, but his condition deteriorated into double pneumonia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical experts have warned that Francis's age and the chronic respiratory disease from which he suffers mean a sustained recovery will take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope, head of the world's nearly 1.4 billion Catholics, had part of one of his lungs removed as a young man and has suffered increasing health problems in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is prone to bronchitis and suffers from hip and knee pain, which has made him reliant on a wheelchair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nonetheless, Francis has continued to work from the special hospital suite on the Gemelli's 10th floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also has been doing breathing exercises in between resting and praying, according to the Vatican. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least four people died from their injuries in India after an avalanche hit a remote border area, officials said on Saturday, as rescuers deployed helicopters to search for the remaining five missing.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 55 workers were buried under snow and debris after the avalanche hit a construction camp on Friday near Mana village on the border with Tibet in the northern Himalayan state of Uttarakhand.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement issued on Saturday, the Indian army said 50 people were initially rescued, but among them, four succumbed to their injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, four injured persons have been confirmed as fatal casualty," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five workers were still missing, the army said, adding that six choppers had been deployed into rescue efforts as the "roads are blocked."
  <br>
  <br>
  Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the rescue teams were "continuously engaged in relief efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is fully committed to providing all possible assistance to those affected in this hour of crisis," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mana village, which shares a border with Tibet, was deserted after residents moved to lower altitudes to escape the extreme weather, The Indian Express newspaper reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avalanches and landslides are common in the upper reaches of the Himalayas, especially during the winter season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists have said climate change was making weather events more severe, while the increased pace of development in the fragile Himalayan regions has also heightened fears about the fallout from deforestation and construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, nearly 100 people died in Uttarakhand after a huge glacier chunk fell into a river, triggering flash floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devastating monsoon floods and landslides in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of development projects in the state. (AFP)

 Search teams in northern India on Saturday attempted to rescue 22 workers believed to be trapped after an avalanche hit a remote border area, officials and local media said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The workers were buried under snow and debris after the avalanche hit a construction camp near a village on the border with Tibet in Chamoli district on Friday.
  <br>

  Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said "relief and rescue operations have been accelerated" with the weather in the area clearing up.

  "Every effort is being made to safely evacuate all the workers trapped in the snow as soon as possible," Dhami said in a post on social media.
  <br>

  Police said the snow buried 55 workers initially.

<img alt="Gene Hackman was a two-time Academy Award winner and credited for intense performances inspired by his troubled upbringing. (AFP)" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793774_1_20250301120931.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hollywood legend Gene Hackman had likely been dead for over a week when he and his wife were found lifeless in their New Mexico home, the local sheriff said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities launched a probe into what they said were the "suspicious" deaths of Hackman, 95, and his classical pianist wife Betsy Arakawa, 63, as questions swirl over how the actor could have died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Santa Fe Sheriff Adan Mendoza told reporters that the partially mummified bodies had no external injuries but initial tests revealed "both individuals had tested negative for carbon monoxide."
  <br>
  <br>
  But, said Mendoza, tests had begun to narrow down a possible date of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An initial interrogation was conducted of Mr Hackman's pacemaker. This revealed that his last event was recorded on February 17, 2025," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that is a very good assumption, that was his last day of life."
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies of the Oscar-winning star of "The French Connection" and his wife were found on Wednesday, after emergency services were called to the scene when maintenance workers had been unable to access the sprawling property.
  <br>
  <br>
  First responders found the door unlocked and open, and pills scattered next to Arakawa's body, which was in the bathroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman's body was found in another room, fully clothed, with sunglasses next to his body, indicating a sudden fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A German Shepherd was found dead in the bathroom, and two other healthy dogs were at the house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mendoza said as they waited for the results of toxicology tests, which might shed some light on the tablets by Arakawa's body, investigators were now trying to piece together a timeline.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included looking through planners and cell phones and searching for any video that might give hints to the couple's movements over the last few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, he said, it was a complicated task, compounded by their low profile.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think everybody here understands that they were very private individuals and a very private family," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman, a two-time Academy Award winner, was credited for intense performances of everyman characters inspired by his troubled upbringing, notching up dozens of movie credits extending into his 70s. (AFP)

    Japan battles biggest wildfire in decades

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan was battling its largest wildfire in more than three decades on Saturday, one of several blazes that have killed one person and forced the evacuation of more than a thousand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flames are estimated to have spread over about 1,200 hectares in the forest of Ofunato in the northern region of Iwate since fire broke out on Wednesday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still examining the size of the affected area, but it is the biggest since the 1992 wildfire in Kushiro, Hokkaido, an agency spokesman told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  That fire burned 1,030 hectares, the previous record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 1,700 firefighters were being mobilised from across the country, the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial footage from public broadcaster NHK showed white smoke billowing up and covering an entire mountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local police found the body of one person who had been burned on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 1,000 nearby residents have been evacuated and more than 80 buildings had been damaged as of Friday, according to the Ofunato municipality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the blaze remained unknown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other fires were also burning Saturday, one in Yamanashi and another elsewhere in Iwate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ofunato has seen only 2.5 millimetres of rainfall this month - on course to fall far below the previous record low for February of 4.4 millimetres in 1967.
  <br>
  <br>
  And last year was Japan's hottest since records began. (AFP)

    Microsoft to shut Skype in favour of Teams

<img alt='The president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms says the company "can deliver more innovation faster just by being focused on Teams." File Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793738_1_20250301070354.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Microsoft on Friday announced it was retiring Skype, the online voice and video call pioneer that the tech titan acquired in 2011.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Starting in May 2025, Skype will no longer be available," said a post from Skype support on X, directing users to sign into Microsoft's Teams platform for further use of its services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Skype was founded in 2003 by Scandinavians Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis in Estonia, revolutionizing internet communication by offering free voice calls between computers and affordable rates for calls to landlines and mobile phones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the years, and as internet speeds improved, Skype evolved to include video calls, instant messaging, file sharing, and group communication features.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 2005, Skype had already reached 50 million registered users, demonstrating its rapid global adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online auction site eBay acquired Skype in 2005 for approximately US$2.6 billion, but the expected synergies never panned out, and in 2009, eBay sold a majority stake to a group of investors, who then sold it to Microsoft.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, especially after the rise of the smartphone, Skype failed to hold onto its place against new rivals such as Meta-owned WhatsApp and Zoom, as well as Microsoft's own Teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've learned a lot from Skype... as we've evolved Teams over the last seven to eight years," Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms, told CNBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we felt like now is the time because we can be simpler for the market, for our customer base, and we can deliver more innovation faster just by being focused on Teams."
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft said that Skype group chats would remain intact in the transition to Teams and that during a 60-day window, messages on Microsoft and Teams will be interoperable so you can message contacts from Teams, and those messages will be delivered to friends still using Skype. (AFP)

    Trump berates Zelensky in shock Oval Office meeting

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump cut short a meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday and said the Ukrainian leader is "not ready" for peace with Russia in an extraordinary meltdown in the Oval Office that threw question marks over chances for a truce.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was meant to be making a full White House visit to sign a US-Ukrainian deal for joint exploitation of Ukraine's mineral resources, as part of a post-war recovery in a US-brokered peace deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, an ugly clash blew up almost immediately in the Oval Office where Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouted at Zelensky, accusing him of not being thankful for US help in the three-year war against Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump berated Zelensky, telling him to be more "thankful" and that without US assistance Ukraine would have been taken by Russia. "You're either going to make a deal or we're out," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky left in his motorcade shortly after, without holding a planned joint press conference. The resources deal was left unsigned, the White House said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took to his Truth Social platform to castigate Zelensky saying "he is not ready for Peace," Trump wrote. "He can come back when he is ready for Peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The dramatic public breakdown in the long-tense relationship between Zelensky and Trump came after their meeting - in front of a large group of journalists - had appeared to get off to a friendlier start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky had said, "I think President Trump is on our side."
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash left in doubt efforts led by Trump to cast himself as mediator in the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the shouting match erupted, Trump told Zelensky that a truce is "fairly close." The US leader also said that the proposed minerals deal would be "very fair."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Friday said Trump showed "restraint" by not hitting Ukrainian Zelensky during their shouting match in the White House. (AFP)

    Argentina agency blasted over disability scale

<img alt="Argentina's President Javier Milei says he is trying to clamp down on disability fraud. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793586_1_20250228072938.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina's state disability agency apologised on Thursday following a furore over the use of the terms "idiot", "imbecile" and "mentally retarded" to describe people with disabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The uproar was caused by a text published as part of libertarian President Javier Milei's clampdown on disability fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government, which is reviewing disability payments received by around a million Argentines, last month issued a decree setting out the parameters of mental and physical disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  An annex to the decree classified people with mental disabilities according to their IQ as follows: "0-30 (idiot)," "30-50 (imbecile)," "50-60 (severely mentally retarded," "60-70 (moderately mentally retarded)," and "70-90 (slightly mentally retarded)".
  <br>
  <br>
  Each category also included a description of which functions the person can perform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disability support groups and human rights groups protested the terminology and demanded that the National Disabilities Agency scrap the classification.
  <br>
  <br>
  The groups accused the agency of using "very violent terminology" which "reinforces stereotypes and historical discrimination".

 US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met at the White House on Thursday for their first in-person talks since the Republican leader upended US policy on Ukraine, the Middle East, and global trade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starmer is the second European leader to meet Trump this week after French President Emmanuel Macron came to the White House on Monday for a friendly encounter that nonetheless displayed stark differences about Russia's war with Ukraine and the US push for a quick ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British leader arrived at the White House on Thursday afternoon, where he was greeted by the president at the West Wing entrance ahead of meetings and a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the US could get a peace deal on Ukraine, Trump said that a peace deal needs to be struck soon between Ukraine and Russia or it may not happen "at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we've made a lot of progress and I think it's moving along pretty rapidly," Trump said. "It'll either be fairly soon or it won't be at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he trusted Russia's Vladimir Putin to stick to any Ukraine ceasefire, as Starmer tried to win security guarantees for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  He walked back a remark about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky being a dictator that alarmed European capitals, saying, "Did I say that?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters as he sat alongside Starmer in the Oval Office when asked about Putin, "I think he'll keep his word."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Britain can "take care of themselves, but if they need help, I'll always be with the British."
  <br>
  <br>
  The British premier told Trump at the White House that he wanted to "work with you to make sure that the peace deal is enduring" but that it was also a "deal that nobody breaches."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also expressed hope for a trade deal to be struck between both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to have a great trade agreement, one way or the other," Trump told reporters. "We're going to end up with a very good trade agreement for both countries, and we're working on that as we speak."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump will host Zelensky at the White House on Friday, where the two leaders are expected to sign a deal giving Washington access to Ukraine's rare minerals, which Trump has demanded as payback for US military aid. (Agencies)

<img alt="Donald Trump says he will double the 10 percent tariff charged on imports from China from March 4. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793557_1_20250227225651.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would impose an added 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports while moving ahead with levies on Canada and Mexico next week, citing "unacceptable" fentanyl smuggling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump had announced – then halted – sweeping 25 percent levies on Canadian and Mexican imports this month over illegal immigration and deadly fentanyl, with Canadian energy to face a lower rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the month-long pause ends next Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following reporters' questions on whether he planned to proceed on the tariffs next week, Trump wrote on social media on Thursday that until the problem of fentanyl stops "or is seriously limited," proposed levies will happen as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will likewise be charged an additional 10 percent Tariff on that date," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not give further details on how the move interacts with an earlier levy he imposed on Chinese imports over Beijing's alleged role in the fentanyl supply chain, or how negotiations with China were proceeding.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has voiced firm opposition to the US decision to impose tariffs on Chinese imports under the pretext of fentanyl-related issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said it is one of the countries with the strictest drug control policies and the most rigorous enforcement in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump added on Truth Social that an April 2 date for so-called reciprocal tariffs "will remain in full force and effect." (AFP/Xinhua)

<img alt="The Trump administration's review in part targeted multi-year foreign assistance contracts awarded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793539_1_20250227201224.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has slashed its multi-year aid contracts by 92 percent, as it sought around US$60 billion in savings in development and overseas humanitarian programmes, the State Department said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office, demanding a 90-day freeze on all US foreign aid to give his administration time to review overseas spending, with an eye to gutting programmes not aligned with his "America First" agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  A federal judge had given the Trump administration on Tuesday less than two days to unfreeze all aid after a previous court order issued nearly two weeks earlier went ignored.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Trump administration filed an emergency petition to the US Supreme Court, which issued an administrative stay late on Wednesday, pausing the lower court's order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the conclusion of a process led by USAID leadership, including tranches personally reviewed by Secretary (Marco) Rubio, nearly 5,800 awards with US$54 billion in value remaining were identified for elimination as part of the America First agenda – a 92 percent reduction," a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration's review in part targeted multi-year foreign assistance contracts awarded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), with the vast majority eliminated during its course.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also looked at more than 9,100 grants involving foreign assistance, valued at more than US$15.9 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the review, 4,100 grants worth almost US$4.4 billion were targeted to be eliminated, a 28 percent reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These commonsense eliminations will allow the bureaus, along with their contracting and grants officers, to focus on remaining programmes, find additional efficiencies and tailor subsequent programmes more closely to the Administration's America First priorities," the State Department statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID distributes US humanitarian aid around the world, with health and emergency programmes in around 120 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Programmes that were not cut included food assistance, life-saving medical treatments for diseases like HIV and malaria, and support for countries including Haiti, Cuba, Venezuela and Lebanon, among others, the State Department spokesperson said. (AFP)
