<img alt="Susan Crawford acknowledges the mood at her election night headquarters in Madison, Wisconsin, after her triumph. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798589_1_20250402120941.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Democratic-backed candidate for Wisconsin Supreme Court defeated a challenger endorsed by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, touting her victory as a win against powerful interests and cementing a liberal majority for at least three more years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Susan Crawford, a Dane County judge who led legal fights to protect union power and abortion rights and to oppose voter ID, stood on stage surrounded by the court's four current liberal justices and celebrated her win as a victory for democracy while also taking a dig at Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I would be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said. “And we won.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and groups he backed had spent more than US$21 million in an effort to defeat Crawford. Musk even traveled to Wisconsin two days before the election to personally hand over US$1 million checks to two voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Today Wisconsinites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our Supreme Court,” Crawford said in her victory speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price, our courts are not for sale.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford defeated Republican-backed Brad Schimel in a race that broke records for spending, was the highest-turnout Wisconsin Supreme Court election ever and became a proxy fight for the nation’s political battles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk was silent on his X platform in the wake of Crawford’s victory, reposting a message about Vietnam and tariffs but nothing on the Supreme Court contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, Musk and other Republicans lined up behind Schimel, a former state attorney general.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats including former president Barack Obama and billionaire megadonor George Soros backed Crawford .
  <br>
  <br>
  The first major election in the country since November was seen as a litmus test of how voters feel about Trump’s first months back in office and the role played by Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency has torn through federal agencies and laid off thousands of workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk traveled to Wisconsin on Sunday to make a pitch for Schimel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford was beating Schimel by more than eight points, based on unofficial results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turnout exceeded 52 percent of the voting age population, topping the record set in 2023 of nearly 40 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spending was on its way to surpass US$100 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schimel told his supporters he had conceded to Crawford, leading to yells of anger. One woman began to chant, “Cheater, cheater!”
  <br>
  <br>
  “No,” Schimel said. “You’ve got to accept the results.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The court can decide election-related laws and settle disputes over future election outcomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford embraced the backing of Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights advocates, running ads that highlighted Schimel’s opposition to the procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also attacked Schimel for his ties to Musk and Republicans, referring to Musk as “Elon Schimel” during a debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schimel’s campaign tried to portray Crawford as weak on crime and puppet of Democrats who, if elected, would push to redraw congressional district boundary lines to hurt Republicans and repeal a GOP-backed state law that took collective bargaining rights away from most public workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voters in Eau Claire seemed to respond to both messages. Jim Seeger, a 68-year-old retiree, said he voted for Schimel because he was concerned about redistricting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim Hazelton, a 68-year-old disabled veteran, said he had planned to abstain but voted for Crawford after Musk, whom he called a “pushy billionaire”,  and Trump got involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s cutting everything,” Hazelton said of Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People need these things he’s cutting.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford’s win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority, as it has been since 2023. A liberal justice is not up for election again until April 2028, ensuring liberals will either maintain or increase their hold on the court until then.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford thanked each of the current liberal justices and hugged each of them after her win. One of the four is retiring, creating the open seat she won.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court likely will be deciding cases on abortion, public sector unions, voting rules and congressional district boundaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Who controls the court also could factor into how it might rule on any future voting challenge in the perennial presidential battleground state, which raised the stakes of the race for national Republicans and Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump endorsed Schimel just 11 days before the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year the court declined to take up a Democratic-backed challenge to congressional lines, but Schimel and Musk have said that if Crawford won, the court would redraw congressional districts to make them more favorable to Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Milwaukee, 22-year-old college student Kenneth Gifford said he feels that Trump has done damage to American institutions and that Musk is trying to buy votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want an actual, respectable democracy,” he said. (AP)

    US senator makes record books with 25-hour talk-a-thon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Democratic US lawmaker shattered a record for the longest speech in Senate history, staying on his feet for more than 25 hours to deliver a fiery protest against President Donald Trump's "unconstitutional" actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senator Cory Booker's display of endurance – to hold the floor he had to remain standing and could not even go to the bathroom – recalled the famous scene in Frank Capra's 1939 film classic "Mr Smith Goes to Washington."
  <br>
  <br>
  The longest Senate speech on record before Booker's feat on Tuesday was delivered by South Carolina's Strom Thurmond, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker, only the fourth Black senator to be popularly elected to the body, blew past that deadline, his voice still strong but emotional as he topped out at 25 hours and five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public galleries of the Senate chamber gradually filled as the moment he broke the record approached, with more Democratic lawmakers joining the session – although Republicans largely stayed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a moral moment. It's not left or right. It's right or wrong," Booker said as he wrapped up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also quoted his mentor John Lewis, a 1960s civil rights movement leader, who urged campaigners to get into "good trouble," before finally pronouncing "Madam President, I yield the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 55-year-old New Jersey native had found a moment for some humour as he passed the record, joking: "I want to go a little bit past this and then I'm going to deal with some of the biological urgencies I'm feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of people gathered outside the US Capitol brandishing signs with messages like "Thank you Senator Booker."
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Booker's talk-a-thon was not actually blocking the majority Republican Party from holding votes in the Senate, as would be the case in a true filibuster, his defiance quickly became a rallying point for beleaguered Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker, a former presidential candidate, seized command in the chamber at 7 pm on Monday (7 am Hong Kong time on Tuesday) and finished at 8:05 pm on Tuesday (8:05 am on Wednesday).
  <br>
  <br>
  He lashed out at Trump's radical cost-cutting policies that have seen his top advisor Elon Musk, the world's richest person, slash entire government programs without consent from Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The senator said Trump's aggressive seizing of ever-more executive power had put US democracy at risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unnecessary hardships are being borne by Americans of all backgrounds," Booker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And institutions which are special in America, which are precious and which are unique in our country, are being recklessly – and I would say even unconstitutionally – affected, attacked, even shattered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In just 71 days the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans' safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he had words of encouragement for Trump opponents, saying as he concluded that "the power of the people is greater than the people in power."
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker later went into detail about how he withstood the physical demands of the speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My strategy was to stop eating. I think I stopped eating Friday and then to stop drinking the night before I started on Monday," he said in the Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  The approach "had its benefits and had its really downsides... different muscle groups start to really cramp up" with dehydration, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement sent by his office, Booker added that he was "tired and a little hoarse."
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic lawmakers, in the minority in both the Senate and House of Representatives, have struggled over how to blunt Trump's efforts to downsize government, ramp up deportations and shred much of the country's political norms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just want to thank you for holding vigil for this country all night," Senator Raphael Warnock told Booker on the floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker dedicated much of his speech to criticizing Trump's policies, but to pass the time he also recited poetry, discussed sports and entertained questions from colleagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you love your neighbor, if you love this country, show your love. Stop them from doing what they're trying to [do]," he said. (AFP)

    Mass layoffs at major US health agencies

<img alt='US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said "Americans are getting sicker every year". File photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798553_1_20250402090430.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mass layoffs began at the major US health agencies on Tuesday as the Trump administration embarks on a sweeping and scientifically-contested restructuring that will cut 10,000 jobs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said the layoffs were part of a major reform of his department, aiming to refocus efforts on chronic disease prevention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling it a "difficult moment for all of us," Kennedy said "our hearts go out to those who have lost their jobs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the reality is clear: what we've been doing isn't working," he added, complaining that "Americans are getting sicker every year" despite increasing spending at the federal agencies guiding US health policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to photos and testimonials posted on social media, employees learned of their dismissal early on Tuesday morning by email or by having their access badges not working when they showed up to work in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The layoffs affect the Department of Health and Human Services and the federal agencies it oversees, such as those in charge of approving new drugs (FDA), responding to epidemics (CDC) or medical research (NIH).
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US media reports, several senior officials from these agencies, including Jeanne Marrazzo, who had replaced Anthony Fauci as head of one of the NIH's branches, have been offered reassignment to isolated locations in Alaska or Oklahoma.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FDA as we've known it is finished, with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed," said Robert Califf, a former FDA commissioner during the Obama and Biden administrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move comes despite the country facing its worst measles outbreak in years and mounting fears that bird flu could spark the next human pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy has alarmed health experts with his rhetoric downplaying the importance of vaccines and even suggesting that avian influenza should be allowed to spread freely among America's poultry. (AFP)

    Volcano erupts in southwestern Iceland

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A volcano in southwestern Iceland - that has erupted repeatedly for more than a year - again belched lava and smoke into the air on Tuesday, just hours after authorities evacuated the few remaining residents of a nearby fishing village.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eruption began at 9:45 am local time, triggering warning sirens in the town of Grindavik where webcams showed molten rock spewing toward the community. It had subsided by late afternoon, though the volcano was still active, Iceland's Met Office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police and civil defence officials evacuated Grindavik and the Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, one of Iceland’s biggest tourist attractions, after an early morning earthquake swarm suggested an eruption was imminent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The community, located on the Reykjanes Peninsula, was largely evacuated in November 2023 when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for some 800 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 homes were evacuated on Tuesday, though police reported that some residents refused to leave their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Those individuals who choose to remain in the town don't seem to consider that I have 50 people involved in this operation, some of whom are volunteers,” Ulfar Luovíksson, police commissioner in South Iceland, told local broadcaster RUV. “I would ask that more consideration be shown towards civil defence.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Iceland sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic . The most disruptive incident in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flights were not affected by Tuesday's eruption. (AP)

    Trump 'perfecting' tariffs with hours to go

<img alt='White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing that the tariffs would take effect "immediately" after the announcement. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798530_1_20250402033307.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump kept the world's leading economies on edge on Tuesday as he made final preparations for a "Liberation Day" announcement of sweeping new tariffs that could trigger a global trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised to be "very kind" when he unveils the so-called reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday, but uncertainty reigned over which countries would be targeted and by how much.
  <br>
  <br>
  His plan has prompted vows of retaliation from major economies - including the European Union and Canada - and fears that it could unleash a recession at home and abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Trump had "made a decision" but was still putting the finishing touches on the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is with his trade and tariff team right now, perfecting it to make sure this is a perfect deal for the American people and the American worker," Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House would not confirm reports in US media that Trump was considering across-the-board tariffs of around 20 percent, rather than different amounts for different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leavitt said the tariffs would take effect "immediately" after the announcement, meaning there would be no time for foreign leaders to negotiate carve-outs before they start.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican billionaire, a fan of tariffs for decades, indicated on Monday night that the tariffs would be lower than what other countries would be charging the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to be very nice, relatively speaking, we're going to be very kind," he said in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics warn that the strategy risks a global trade war, provoking a chain reaction of retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  America's trading partners have been preparing to respond, even as they continue efforts to make last-minute negotiations with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to be very deliberate in terms of the measures we take, to fight for Canada," Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who spoke to Trump last week, said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union, which Trump has accused of trying to "screw" the United States, said on Tuesday it still hoped to negotiate a solution - but that "all instruments are on the table" to retaliate if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with Trump on "productive negotiations" towards a UK-US trade deal. Vietnam said on Tuesday it would slash duties on a range of goods to appease Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The president is always up to take a phone call, always up for a good negotiation," Leavitt said. (AFP)

<img alt="Marine Le Pen on Monday was given a prison term and fine after being convicted of a fake jobs scheme at the EU parliament. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798529_1_20250402032757.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A French appeals court said on Tuesday it would examine Marine Le Pen's case within a timeframe that could potentially allow the far-right leader to contest the 2027 presidential election if her conviction is overturned.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a court ruling many commentators called a political earthquake, Le Pen on Monday was given a prison term and fine after being convicted of a fake jobs scheme at the EU parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the most serious part of the conviction was a five-year ban - effective immediately - on standing for office, which eliminates her from the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing her lawmakers on Tuesday, Le Pen, who considered herself the favourite in the 2027 election in which President Emmanuel Macron cannot stand again, accused "the system" of rolling out "the nuclear bomb" to end her presidential hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they use such a powerful weapon against us, it's obviously because we're about to win an election," said Le Pen, 56. "We won't let this happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris Court of Appeal said later on Tuesday that it would examine Le Pen's case "within a timeframe that should allow a decision to be reached in the summer of 2026".
  <br>
  <br>
  This could mean that the new trial would be held by early 2026 at the latest, and that the decision would therefore be handed down well before the 2027 presidential election, in which Le Pen wants to run for the fourth time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement signed by the chief justice, Jacques Boulard, and the attorney general, Marie-Suzanne Le Queau, the court said it had received three appeals against the rulings handed down on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was made after Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin, speaking during a tense parliament session, expressed hope that Le Pen's appeal would be heard within the "most reasonable timeframe".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I personally hope that if Mrs Le Pen lodges an appeal, this new judgement at the Paris Court of Appeal can take place within the most reasonable timeframe," Darmanin told parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the court decision could deepen France's political crisis and cast a shadow on the upcoming 2027 polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen's National Rally (RN), which is the largest single party in parliament, can complicate life for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, who does not have a majority in the lower house National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Le Pen loses her appeal, there is also a "plan B", a candidacy by her protege and RN party leader Jordan Bardella, a 29-year-old with a slick television and social media presence. (AFP)

    Far-right party chief calls for rally over Le Pen ban

<img alt="Marine Le Pen with Jordan Bardella at the Elysee presidential palace in Paris in August. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798485_1_20250401174939.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far-right party chief Jordan Bardella called on the French to rally this weekend to protest against a ruling that banned Marine Le Pen from running for public office for five years after being found guilty of embezzling European Union funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monday's ruling was a catastrophic setback for Le Pen, the long-time National Rally (RN) leader, who had been the front-runner in opinion polls for the 2027 presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe today that the French must be outraged, and I tell them: Be outraged!" Bardella told Europe 1 radio and CNews TV over a ruling that far-right leaders said was biased and undemocratic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll take to the streets this weekend. We're organising leaflet distributions, democratic, peaceful, calm mobilisations," he said, without giving details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bardella could become the RN's de facto candidate for the 2027 election. But Le Pen suggested she was not yet ready to hand him the baton, saying on Monday: "I'm not going to let myself be eliminated like this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bardella backed her on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she would appeal as soon as possible against what she described as a politicised ruling aimed at blocking her presidential bid. Le Pen has run three times for president and had said 2027 would be her final run for top office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge in the court hearing on Monday, Benedicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been "at the heart" of a scheme to misappropriate more than 4 million euros (US$4.3 million) of EU funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lack of remorse by Le Pen and other defendants was among reasons that prompted the court to ban them from running for office with immediate effect, de Perthuis said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was given a four-year prison sentence - two years of which are suspended and two years to be served under home detention - and a 100,000-euro (US$108,200) fine, but they will not apply until her appeals are exhausted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appeals in France can take months or even years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants were not accused of pocketing the money but rather of using it illegally to pay the party's staff back home instead of EU parliamentary assistants. They denied wrongdoing and said the money was used legitimately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite outrage over the ruling among the far right in France, Europe and beyond who were joined in their condemnation of what they called judicial overreach, an opinion poll showed a majority of French people agreed with the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some politicians, including former Socialist President Francois Hollande, said it was important to respect the independence of the judicial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifty-seven percent of those interviewed by Elabe pollsters said the ruling was normal considering what Le Pen was accused of, while 42 percent considered it was politically biased.
  <br>
  <br>
  The poll, carried out for BFM TV, also showed that 42 percent of voters were happy with the ruling, with 29 percent unhappy - while 29 percent did not care.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Emmanuel Macron and his minority, centre-right government were yet to react officially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the ruling, mainstream politicians including Prime Minister Francois Bayrou had said they were ill at ease with the idea that any ban on Le Pen could be enforced immediately and stop her from running in 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the streets of Paris, and in Le Pen's stronghold of Henin-Beaumont, in northern France, reactions were mixed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a shame, it's a shame because we needed a different president, we needed the RN to win," 56-year-old resident Pascal Walkowiak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another resident, 60-year-old Isabelle, said: "Too bad for her. I think it's a good thing because she made mistakes. And well, there you go, she can't represent us, actually." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Aid groups in the worst-hit areas of Myanmar said there was an urgent need for shelter, food and water after an earthquake that killed more than 2,700 people, but said the country's civil war could prevent help reaching those in need.
 <br>
  <br>
  The death toll had reached 2,719 and is expected to rise to more than 3,000, Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing said in a televised address on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 4,521 people were injured, and 441 were missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7 magnitude quake, which hit around lunchtime on Friday, was the strongest to hit the Southeast Asian country in more than a century, toppling ancient pagodas and modern buildings alike.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring Thailand, rescuers pressed on with searching for life in the rubble of a collapsed skyscraper in Bangkok, but acknowledged time was against them.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar's Mandalay area, 50 children and two teachers were killed when their preschool collapsed, said the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the hardest-hit areas ...communities struggle to meet their basic needs, such as access to clean water and sanitation, while emergency teams work tirelessly to locate survivors and provide life-saving aid," the UN body said in a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Rescue Committee said shelter, food, water and medical help were all needed in places such as Mandalay, near the epicentre of the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having lived through the terror of the earthquake, people now fear aftershocks and are sleeping outside on roads or in open fields," an IRC worker in Mandalay said in a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The civil war in Myanmar, where the junta seized power in a coup in 2021, has complicated efforts to reach those injured and made homeless by the Southeast Asian nation's biggest quake in a century.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amnesty International said the junta needed to allow aid to reach areas of the country not under its control. Rebel groups say the junta has conducted airstrikes after the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Myanmar's military has a longstanding practice of denying aid to areas where groups who resist it are active," Amnesty's Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It must immediately allow unimpeded access to all humanitarian organisations and remove administrative barriers delaying needs assessments."
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta's tight control over communication networks and the damage to roads, bridges and other infrastructure caused by the quakes have intensified the challenges for aid workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai officials said a meeting of regional leaders in Bangkok this week would go ahead as planned, although the junta's Min Aung Hlaing may attend by teleconference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the quake struck, sources said the junta chief had been expected to make a rare foreign trip to attend the summit in Bangkok on Thursday and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar's capital Naypyitaw, rescue workers saved a 63-year-old woman from the rubble of a building on Tuesday, but hope was fading of finding many more survivors of the violent earthquake, compounding a humanitarian crisis caused by a bloody civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Myanmar fire department in the Naypyitaw said the woman was successfully pulled from the rubble early on Tuesday, 91 hours after being buried when the building collapsed in the 7.7 magnitude earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake's epicenter was near the country's second-largest city Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those figures are widely expected to rise, but the earthquake hit a wide swath of the country, leaving many areas without power, telephone or cell connections and damaging roads and bridges, leaving the full extent of the devastation hard to assess.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the reports so far have come from Mandalay and Naypyitaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization said overall, more than 10,000 buildings are known to have collapsed or been severely damaged in central and northwest Myanmar. (Reuters/AP)

    Three killed in Beirut as Israel targets top militant

<img alt="The airstrike targeted a Hezbollah militant in the top three floors of a building in south Beirut. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798455_1_20250401160916.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least three people were killed and seven wounded in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs on Tuesday, the Lebanese health ministry said, further testing a shaky four-month ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said in a statement that it attacked a Hezbollah militant "who had recently directed Hamas operatives and assisted them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack took place a few days after a previous strike by Israel on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, a Hezbollah stronghold known as the Dahiyeh.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate statement from Hezbollah on the identity of the target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the latest Israeli airstrike, calling it a "dangerous warning" that signals premeditated intentions against Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aoun said Israel's growing "aggression" requires Lebanon to intensify diplomatic outreach and mobilise international allies in support of the country's full sovereignty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam also condemned the Israeli strike and said it was a flagrant breach of UN Resolution 1701 and the ceasefire arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nawaf said that he has been closely monitoring the aftermath of the strike in coordination with the ministers of defence and interior.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike appeared to have damaged the upper three floors of a building in Beirut's southern suburbs, with the balconies of those floors blown out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The glass on the floors below was intact, indicating a targeted strike. Ambulances were at the scene to recover casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no evacuation warning issued for the area ahead of the strike, and families fled in the aftermath to other parts of Beirut, according to witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  November's ceasefire agreement halted the year-long conflict and mandated that southern Lebanon be free of Hezbollah fighters and weapons, that Lebanese troops deploy to the area and that Israeli ground troops withdraw from the zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  But each side accuses the other of not entirely living up to those terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-brokered truce has looked increasingly flimsy lately. Israel delayed a promised troop withdrawal in January and said that it had intercepted rockets fired from Lebanon in March, which led it to bombard targets in Beirut's southern suburbs and southern Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Iran-aligned Hezbollah has denied any involvement in the rocket firings. (Reuters)

    Australia hit by floods in inland area size of France

<img alt="A homestead is inundated by floodwaters near the town of Jundah in south-west Queensland. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798443_1_20250401145343.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Whole herds of cattle have drowned in vast inland floods sweeping across the Australian outback, officials said on Tuesday, as the muddy tide drenched an area the size of France.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swollen rivers burst their banks after unusually heavy downpours last week over outback Queensland, an arid region home to some of the country's largest cattle ranches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said more than 100,000 livestock – cattle, sheep, goats and horses – had been swept away, were missing, or had drowned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are only early indications of the magnitude of this disaster and while these preliminary numbers are shocking, we are expecting them to continue to climb as flood waters recede," said state agriculture minister Tony Perrett.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's heartbreaking to consider what western Queenslanders will be going through over the weeks and months as they discover the full extent of losses and damage – and start the long slog to start again."
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers have repeatedly warned that climate change amplifies the risk of natural disasters such as bushfires, floods and cyclones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flood waters stretched some 500,000 square kilometres across sparsely populated western Queensland, Perrett said, a landmass roughly equivalent to France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry body AgForce told local media some cattle ranches may have lost almost 100 percent of their herd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government Bureau of Meteorology said some towns had recorded as much as 500 millimetres of rain in the space of a week – their typical yearly total.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, more rainfall is on the way," forecaster Dean Narramore said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reason why we are so concerned about that is because we have numerous flood warnings current for much of Queensland."
  <br>
  <br>
  Muddy livestock survived by crowding together on the few small hills cresting above the flood waters, photos posted to social media showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Queensland's fire department used helicopters to drop bales of fodder near surviving animals cut off from food.
  <br>
  <br>
  The state's primary industries department said some 4,000 kilometres of road had been flooded – a distance greater than the famed Route 66 connecting Chicago to Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rising waters on Tuesday morning encircled the remote outpost of Thargomindah, which describes itself as Australia's farthest town from the sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  A makeshift dirt flood levy was dug around the town to protect its 200 residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preparations are well under way, including securing food deliveries, ensuring the airport has enough aircraft fuel and if need be an evacuation point and accommodation," the shire council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our shire's isolated properties are stocked with food and supplies and doing okay under the circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's so-called "channel country" is one of the nation's biggest cattle fattening grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the time its sweeping plains are dry and inhospitable.
  <br>
  <br>
  But cattle gorge themselves on the pastures that sprout whenever wet season rains fill the dry creek beds – or channels – that snake through the region. (AFP)

<img alt="At the CinemaCon in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas are, from left, Sam Mendes, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn, Barry Keoghan and Harris Dickinson. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798436_1_20250401134811.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sam Mendes will release four movies about The Beatles in the same month, the director has announced, with Paul Mescal playing Paul McCartney and Harris Dickinson portraying John Lennon in "the first bingeable theatrical experience."
 <br>
  <br>
  The "four-film cinematic event," hitting theaters in April 2028, will each focus on a different member of the legendary British pop quartet, with Barry Keoghan playing Ringo Starr and Joseph Quinn as George Harrison.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each one is told from the particular perspective of just one of the guys," Mendes told the CinemaCon movie theater convention in Las Vegas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They intersect in different ways – sometimes overlapping, sometimes not.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're four very different human beings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But together, all four films will tell the story of the greatest band in history."
  <br>
  <br>
  Filming is about to begin, and is expected to take more than a year, said Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact order in which the movies will be released has not yet been revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'd been trying to make a film about the Beatles for years, but I had temporarily given up," explained "American Beauty" Oscar-winner Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just felt the story of the band was too huge to fit into a single movie, and that turning it into a TV mini-series just somehow didn't feel right."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came at the start of the CinemaCon trade convention, where movie theater owners gather annually in Las Vegas to hear Hollywood studios' plans for the coming months and years.
  <br>
  <br>
  While 2025 had been widely touted as the year that the movie industry would bounce back, the box office has so far endured a terrible start, reeling from high-profile flops like Disney's live-action "Snow White" and sci-fi "Mickey 17."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US$1.3 billion taken in North America receipts so far is seven percent below an already lean first quarter of last year, which was itself derailed by the previous year's massive Hollywood strikes. (AFP)

 A massive fire caused by a gas pipeline leak forced people from their homes and injured more than 100 during Eid celebrations near Malaysia's capital on Tuesday, fire officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inferno, which was visible kilometres away, was caused by "a gas pipeline leak stretching approximately 500 metres," said fire officials in Selangor state near Kuala Lumpur.
  <br>
  <br>
  The valve to the affected pipeline belonging to Malaysia's state-run oil firm Petronas has been shut off, the fire officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the early morning blaze was coming under control in the afternoon, more than 100 people were injured, the fire department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 60 of the injured were hospitalised, Selangor deputy police chief Mohamad Zaini Abu Hassan was quoted as saying by local broadcaster Astro Awani.
  <br>
  <br>
  No deaths were reported but about 50 houses were affected by the blaze, the fire department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents were enjoying a public holiday for Eid celebrations in Muslim-majority Malaysia when they were forced to flee the suburban area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nizam Mohamad Asnizam, 49, who lives 100 metres from the site of the fire, fled from his house with his family in his car.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I woke up, I saw the fire raging, with an extraordinary sound. I have never experienced a fire with this kind of sound. The sound was terrifying. It felt like a jet engine was next to me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stepping on the floor was like stepping on a hot wok. The heat was like putting your head in an oven, it felt like I was burning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dashcam footage shared online showed a column of fire from what appears to be an explosion, creating a massive fireball that shot into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another video shared online showed a residential area covered in smoke while a huge fire blazed in the background. Singed trees and melted cars are also seen in the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selangor Chief Minister Amirudin Shari said in a Facebook post that a temporary relief centre had been set up at a nearby mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  He warned the public to stay away from the area affected by the fire while investigations and rescue work were being carried out. (AFP)

<img alt="Sales of Tesla EVs are slowing in Europe amid a growing backlash against its CEO Elon Musk over his political views. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798413_1_20250401120524.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla investors are bracing for a drop in first-quarter vehicle deliveries as a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's politics exacerbates weakening demand for the electric vehicle maker's lineup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk promised Tesla would return to growth this year after its annual deliveries fell for the first time in 2024, and Wall Street will be watching to see how a refreshed Model Y SUV and incentives made a difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla has been grappling with rising global competition and mass protests against Musk's role overseeing cuts to federal spending as an adviser to US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>

   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's San Francisco correspondent Mark Niu said dismay at Musk's government cutbacks plus disdain towards his personal politics was affecting Tesla's business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's certainly has taken a toll on Tesla's stock [price] which rose sharply when Donald Trump won the election with Musk being his biggest financial backer. It hit a record of US$480 and today it's around US$259  ... with regard to sales one thing is quite clear: sales of new Tesla cars have slumped in Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company has been offering discounts and other incentives, including low-cost financing, but these seemed to have had little impact in Europe, where sales declined in the first two months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of China-made Teslas fell as well. Chinese rivals including BYD have ramped up a price war and launched at least six models in the past year to take on the Model Y. (Reuters)

<img alt="SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket carries the four commercial astronauts into a 90-degree inclination polar orbit on the Fram2 mission after launching from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798408_1_20250401112340.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A bitcoin investor who bought a SpaceX flight for himself and three polar explorers has blasted off on the first rocket ride to carry people over the North and South poles .
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Chun, a Chinese-born entrepreneur, hurtled into orbit on Monday night from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX’s Falcon rocket steered southward over the Atlantic, putting the space tourists on a path never flown before in 64 years of human spaceflight .
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang won’t say how much he paid Elon Musk’s SpaceX for the three-and-a-half day ultimate polar adventure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first leg of their flight – from Florida to the South Pole – took barely half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the targeted altitude of some 440 kilometres, their fully automated capsule will circle the globe in roughly one-and-a-half  hours, including 46 minutes to fly from pole to pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Enjoy the views of the poles. Send us some pictures,” SpaceX Launch Control radioed once the capsule reached orbit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang has already visited the polar regions in person and wants to view them from space.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trip is also about “pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge,” he said ahead of the flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now a citizen of Malta, he took along three guests: Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge and Australian polar guide Eric Philips.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikkelsen, the first Norwegian bound for space, has flown over the poles before, but at a much lower altitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was part of the 2019 record-breaking mission that circumnavigated the world via the poles in a Gulfstream jet to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s moon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crew plans two dozen experiments – including taking the first human X-rays in space – and brought along more cameras than usual to document their journey called Fram2 after the Norwegian polar research ship from more than a century ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until now, no space traveler had ventured beyond 65 degrees north and south latitude, just shy of the Arctic and Antarctic circles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first woman in space, the Soviet Union’s Valentina Tereshkova, set that mark in 1963. Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and other pioneering cosmonauts came almost as close, as did NASA shuttle astronauts in 1990.
  <br>
  <br>
  A polar orbit is ideal for climate and Earth-mapping satellites as well as spy satellites.
  <br>
  <br>
  That’s because a spacecraft can observe the entire world each day, circling Earth from pole to pole as it rotates below.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geir Klover, director of the Fram Museum in Oslo, Norway, where the original polar ship is on display, hopes the trip will draw more attention to climate change and the melting polar caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lent the crew a tiny piece of the ship's wooden deck that bears the signature of Oscar Wisting, who with Roald Amundsen in the early 1900s became the first to reach both poles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang pitched the idea of a polar flight to SpaceX in 2023, two years after US tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman made the first of two chartered flights with Musk’s company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaacman is now in the running for NASA’s top job.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX's Kiko Dontchev said late last week that the company is continually refining its training so “normal people” without traditional aerospace backgrounds can “hop in a capsule ... and be calm about it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang and his crew view the polar flight as like camping in the wild and embrace the challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Spaceflight is becoming increasingly routine and, honestly, I’m happy to see that,” Wang said via X last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said he's been counting up his flights since his first one in 2002, flying on planes, helicopters and hot air balloons in his quest to visit every country.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, he’s visited more than half.
  <br>
  <br>
  He arranged it so that liftoff would mark his 1,000th flight. (AP)

    Bangkok reviews construction safety in quake aftermath

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities said they were investigating why a single office tower block under construction in Bangkok collapsed during Friday's earthquake that otherwise caused limited damage in the capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok governor Chadchart Sittipunt visited the site on Monday as heavy equipment pulled away rubble from the 30-storey State Audit Office building in hopes of finding the 78 people still missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even one life saved is worth all the effort, so I think we have to move on, carry on,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the longer run it's important to ensure building safety in the city, where millions of people live and work in thousands of high-rise buildings, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The magnitude 7.7 quake, which was centred more than 1,200 km away, killed more than 2,000 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, most of them at the Bangkok construction site near the popular Chatuchak Market.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we need to find the root cause so at least we can learn some lessons and improve building regulations," Chadchart said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the end, we will have some results that will improve safety in Bangkok.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in the property developer handling the project, Italian Thai Development, fell 27 percent in trading on Monday as questions were raised about the building's design, enforcement of construction safety codes, and the Chinese contractor building the State Audit Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, whose family owns one of Thailand’s largest construction conglomerates, said he has ordered an investigation committee to be set up and to report the results back to him within seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed to three possible factors behind the collapse: the designer, the inspectors or the builders. (AP)

    Impeachment crunch time for Yoon on Friday

<img alt="Yoon Suk-yeol will learn whether he has the top job in South Korea come Friday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798397_1_20250401101622.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s Constitutional Court said it will rule on whether to formally dismiss or reinstate impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It has been deliberating on Yoon’s political fate over his ill-fated imposition of martial law that triggered a massive political crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The won reversed earlier losses to turn higher against the US dollar after the announcement of the ruling date.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market's benchmark KOSPI was up 1.5 percent after the announcement of the ruling, after pairing earlier gains to 0.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court, which currently has eight justices with one seat vacant, can decide to oust Yoon only when six or more judges agree, according to South Korea's constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whatever decision is, it will likely deepen domestic divisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millions have rallied in Seoul and elsewhere to support or denounce Yoon in the past few months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they’ll mobilise all available personnel to preserve order and respond to acts of vandalism, arson and assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition-controlled liberal National Assembly in December voted to impeach Yoon, a conservative, leaving his political fate in the hands of the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is facing a separate criminal trial after he was arrested and indicted by prosecutors in January on rebellion charges in connection with his December 3 martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court’s endorsement of Yoon’s impeachment would officially drive him out of office and prompt a national election within two months to find a new president.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it overturns Yoon’s impeachment, he would immediately return to his presidential duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the heart of the matter is Yoon’s decision to send hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after imposing martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has insisted that he aimed to maintain order, but some military and military officials have said Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to frustrate a floor vote on his decree and detain his political opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon argues that he didn’t intend to maintain martial law for long, and he only wanted to highlight what he called the “wickedness” of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda, impeached senior officials and slashed his budget bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his martial law announcement, he called the assembly “a den of criminals” and “anti-state forces.”
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, a president has the right to declare martial law in wartime or other emergency situations, but the Democratic Party and its supporters say South Korea wasn’t in such a situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Party-led impeachment motion accused Yoon of suppressing parliament's activities, attempting to detain politicians and others and undermining peace in violation of the constitution and other laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has said he had no intention of disrupting National Assembly operations and detaining anyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s martial law lasted only six hours because lawmakers managed to enter the assembly and vote to strike down his decree unanimously.
  <br>
  <br>
  No violence erupted, but live TV footage showing armed soldiers arriving at the assembly invoked painful memories of past military-backed dictatorships. It was the first time for South Korea to be placed under martial law since 1980. (AP/Reuters)

    Myanmar to mark minute of silence for quake victims

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar will mark a minute of silence on Tuesday in tribute to victims of the country's devastating earthquake that has killed more than 2,000 people, as hopes dim of finding more survivors in the rubble of ruined buildings.
 <br>
  <br>
  National flags will fly at half-mast until April 6 "in sympathy for the loss of life and damages" from Friday's massive quake, the ruling junta said in a statement on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of a week of national mourning, the junta announced the minute's silence to begin Tuesday at 12:51:02 pm - the precise time the 7.7-magnitude quake struck.
  <br>
  <br>
  People should stop where they are to pay respect to the victims, the junta said, while media should halt broadcasting and show mourning symbols, and prayers will be offered at temples and pagodas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the tempo and urgency of rescue efforts wound down in Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country's second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta said Monday that 2,056 have now been confirmed dead, with more than 3,900 people injured and 270 still missing, but the toll is expected to rise significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three Chinese nationals are said to be among the dead, along with two French people.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 19 deaths have been confirmed hundreds of kilometres away in Thailand's capital Bangkok, where the force of the quake caused a 30-storey tower block under construction to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diggers continue to clear the vast pile of rubble at the site, where a dozen deaths have been confirmed and at least 75 people are still unaccounted for. Officials say they have not given up hope of finding more survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States said on Monday it had dispatched a disaster relief team to Myanmar, defending the pace of the deployment following President Donald Trump's dismantling of America's main overseas aid agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake struck on Friday, on the same day that Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was formally dissolving the US Agency for International Development (USAID), arguing that the "gains were too few and the costs were too high," after cutting more than 80 percent of its projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, Russia and India have already sent teams to Myanmar. (AFP)

 Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams said on Monday that they hold themselves partly responsible for what went wrong on their extended stay in space and would fly on Boeing's Starliner again.
 <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX recently ferried the duo home after more than nine months at the International Space Station, filling in for Boeing, which returned to Earth without them last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In their first news conference since coming home, the pair said they were taken aback by all the interest and insisted they were only doing their job and putting the mission ahead of themselves and even their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore didn't shy from accepting some of the blame for Boeing's bungled test flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ll start and point the finger and I’ll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide,” he told reporters. “All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Both astronauts said they would strap into Starliner again. “Because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work,” Wilmore said, adding he'd go back up “in a heartbeat.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams noted that Starliner has “a lot of capability” and she wants to see it succeed. “We're all in,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two will meet with Boeing leadership on Wednesday to provide a rundown on the flight and its problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not for pointing fingers,” Wilmore said. “It's just to make the path clearer going forward.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The longtime astronauts and retired Navy captains ended up spending 286 days in space - 278 days more than planned when they blasted off on Boeing’s first astronaut flight on June 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test pilots had to intervene in order for the Starliner capsule to reach the space station, as thrusters failed and helium leaked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their space station stay kept getting extended as engineers debated how to proceed. NASA finally judged Starliner too dangerous to bring Wilmore and Williams back and transferred them to SpaceX. But the launch of their replacements got stalled, stretching their mission beyond nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dragged-out drama finally ended two weeks ago with a flawless splashdown by SpaceX off the Florida Panhandle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa said engineers still do not understand why Starliner’s thrusters malfunctioned; more tests are planned through the summer. If engineers can figure out the thruster and leak issues, “Starliner is ready to go," Wilmore said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The space agency may require another test flight - with cargo - before allowing astronauts to climb aboard. That redo could come by year's end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Starliner’s rocky road, Nasa officials said they stand behind the decision made years ago to have two competing US companies providing taxi service to and from the space station. But time is running out: The space station is set to be abandoned in five years and replaced in orbit by privately operated labs. (AP)

    Trump task force to review Harvard's funding

 Harvard University has become the latest target in the Trump administration’s approach to fight campus anti-semitism, with the announcement of a new “comprehensive review” that could jeopardise billions of dollars for the Ivy League college.
 <br>
  <br>
  A federal anti-semitism task force is reviewing more than US$255 million in contracts between Harvard and the federal government to make sure the school is following civil rights laws, the administration announced on Monday. The government also will examine US$8.7 billion in grant commitments to Harvard and its affiliates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The same task force cut US$400 million from Columbia University and threatened to slash billions more if it refused a list of demands from President Donald Trump's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Columbia agreed to many of the changes this month, drawing praise from some Jewish groups and condemnation from free speech groups, who see it as a stunning intrusion by the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of other universities have been put on notice by the Trump administration that they could face similar treatment over allegations of anti-semitism. The federal government is a major provider of revenue for American universities through grants for scientific research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education Secretary Linda McMahon said Harvard symbolises the American Dream, but has jeopardised its reputation by “promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry” and failing to protect students from anti-semitism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard President Alan Garber acknowledged that anti-semitism exists even on his campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but he said Harvard has done much to fight it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard will ensure the government has a full account of the university's work, Garber said. If federal funding is pulled, he added, it will “halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's renewed offensive in Gaza has reportedly left at least 322 children dead and 609 wounded in the Palestinian territory in the past 10 days, UNICEF said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figures include children who were reportedly killed or wounded when the surgical department of Al Nasser Hospital, in southern Gaza, was hit in an attack on March 23, the UN children's agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  UNICEF said most of these children were displaced, and sheltering in makeshift tents or damaged homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ending a nearly two-month ceasefire in the war with Hamas, Israel resumed intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 and then launched a new ground offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire in Gaza provided a desperately needed lifeline for Gaza's children and hope for a path to recovery," said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But children have again been plunged into a cycle of deadly violence and deprivation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell added: "All parties must adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect children."
  <br>
  <br>
  The UNICEF statement said that after nearly 18 months of war, more than 15,000 children have reportedly been killed, over 34,000 reportedly injured, and nearly one million children have been displaced repeatedly and denied basic services.
  <br>
  <br>
  UNICEF called for an end to hostilities and for Israel to end its ban on humanitarian aid entering Gaza, which has been in force since March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said children who are sick or wounded should be evacuated to receive medical attention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Food, safe water, shelter, and medical care have become increasingly scarce. Without these essential supplies, malnutrition, diseases and other preventable conditions will likely surge, leading to an increase in preventable child deaths," UNICEF said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world must not stand by and allow the killing and suffering of children to continue," it added. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI on Monday said it raised US$40 billion in a new funding round that valued the ChatGPT maker at US$300 billion, the biggest capital-raising session ever for a startup.
 <br>
  <br>
  The infusion of cash comes in a partnership with Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group and "enables us to push the frontiers of AI research even further," the San Francisco-based company said in a post on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their support will help us continue building AI systems that drive scientific discovery, enable personalised education, enhance human creativity, and pave the way toward AGI (artificial general intelligence) that benefits all of humanity," the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AGI refers to a computing platform with human-level intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank said in a release that it is on a mission to realise Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that surpasses human intelligence, and that OpenAI is the partner closest to achieving that goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advancement of OpenAI's AI models is key to achieving AGI and ASI, and massive computing power is essential," SoftBank stated in its rationale for the latest investment in the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank is to pump US$10 billion into OpenAI to start, and US$30 billion more by the end of this year pending certain conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI plans to scale its infrastructure and "deliver increasingly powerful tools for the 500 million people who use ChatGPT every week." (AFP)

    Trump will 'be kind' over further tariffs this week

<img alt="US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798346_1_20250401021518.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said Monday he would be "very kind" to trading partners when he unveils further tariffs this week, risking global turmoil to address what he says are unfair trade imbalances.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump - who has been making unprecedented use of presidential powers since taking office in January - said he could announce as early as Tuesday night exactly what "reciprocal tariffs" will be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican billionaire insists that reciprocal action is needed because the world's biggest economy has been "ripped off by every country in the world," promising "Liberation Day" for the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could also unveil more sector-specific levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for details, he told reporters Monday: "You're going to see in two days, which is maybe tomorrow night or probably Wednesday."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added: "We're going to be very nice, relatively speaking, we're going to be very kind."
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics warn that the strategy risks a global trade war, provoking a chain reaction of retaliation by major trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already, China, South Korea and Japan agreed on Sunday to strengthen free trade between themselves, ahead of Trump's expected tariff announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said on Monday that he was not worried his action would push allies toward Beijing, adding that a deal on TikTok could also be tied to China tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, President Trump downplayed risks that TikTok was in danger of being banned in the United States, saying he was confident of finding a buyer for the app's US business by a Friday deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has over 170 million American users, is under threat from a law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner ByteDance or face a ban in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican president quickly announced a delay that has allowed it to continue to operate; that delay is set to expire on April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of potential buyers. There's tremendous interest in TikTok," Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One late Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of people that want to buy TikTok. We're dealing with China also on it, because they may have something to do with it," he said, adding "I'd like to see TikTok remain alive." (AFP)

<img alt="US President Donald Trump (Left) earlier criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin for the lack of progress on a ceasefire deal. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798328_1_20250331211156.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday said that President Vladimir Putin was still "open" to speaking to Donald Trump after the US president said he was "very angry" with the Russian leader over little progress on a ceasefire in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier criticised both Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, as he pushes to end more than three years of conflict in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told NBC he was "pissed off" at Putin for questioning Zelensky's credibility as someone to negotiate with and for calling for new authorities in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The president remains open to contact with President Trump," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing call.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there was no phone call scheduled between the two leaders, but that one could be "organised promptly" if deemed "necessary".
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin earlier this month rejected a US proposal of an unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, that Zelensky backed, and has upped his rhetoric on Moscow wanting to install new leadership in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are continuing work.. Firstly, on developing bilateral relations and also working on implementing some ideas, linked to resolving the Ukrainian (conflict)," Peskov said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Work is ongoing. There is nothing concrete yet. This process is time-consuming, probably due to the fact of the complexity of the substance," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, NBC News journalist Kristen Walker said Trump had called her to say he was angry with Putin and threatened tariffs on firms dealing with Russian oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later said he was "disappointed" with Putin for his comments on Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's supposed to be making a deal with him, whether you like him or you don't like him," Trump said. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The Fukushima nuclear disaster was one of three 2011 chain of events that changed the way that Tokyo traditionally regarded the 'megaquake' scenario. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798306_1_20250331182035.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A "megaquake" and subsequent tsunami could cause up to 298,000 deaths in Japan and damage costing up to US$2 trillion, the government said on Monday in a new estimate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figures have been updated from a previous estimate, made in 2014, for the potential consequences of a huge earthquake along the Nankai Trough south of Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 800-kilometre undersea trench runs from Shizuoka, west of Tokyo, to the southern tip of Kyushu island.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is where the Philippine Sea oceanic tectonic plate is "subducting" –  or slowly slipping – underneath the continental plate that Japan sits atop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plates become stuck as they move, storing up vast amounts of energy that is released when they break free, causing potentially massive earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cabinet Office's disaster management working group said up to 215,000 people would be killed by a tsunami, 73,000 by the collapse of buildings and 9,000 by fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the predicted toll as a whole is lower than the 2014 estimate that said up to 323,000 people would die.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past 1,400 years, megaquakes in the Nankai Trough have occurred every 100 to 200 years. The last one happened in 1946.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say it is extremely difficult to predict quakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in January, a government panel said the probability of such a megaquake in the next 30 years has marginally increased, with a 75-82 percent chance of it happening.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued its first "megaquake advisory" under rules drawn up after the devastating 2011 earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the likelihood of a new major earthquake along the Nankai Trough was higher than normal after a magnitude 7.1 jolt in southern Japan that injured 14 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advisory was lifted after a week but caused shortages of rice and other staples as people replenished their emergency stocks. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A French court on Monday banned far-right leader Marine Le Pen from running for office after her conviction over a fake jobs scheme, specifying that the sanction should come into force with immediate effect even if an appeal is lodged.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ruling could mean that Le Pen will not be able to stand for president in 2027 elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  She left the courtroom after her conviction and this sanction were announced, but before the judge announced rulings on a potential prison sentence and fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court had earlier in the day found Le Pen guilty of misappropriating EU funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen, head of the far-right National Rally, is the front-runner in opinion polls ahead of the 2027 vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors had asked that Le Pen face an immediate five-year ban from public office if found guilty, regardless of any appeal process, using a so-called "provisional execution" measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  An automatic five-year ban would hammer Le Pen, 56, a three-time presidential contender who has said 2027 will be her final run for top office.
  <br>
  <br>
  She would retain her parliamentary seat until the end of her mandate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen has accused prosecutors of seeking her "political death," alleging a plot to keep the National Rally from power that echoes claims made by US President Donald Trump about his legal woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen, the National Rally and two dozen party figures were accused of diverting European parliament funds to pay France-based party staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants said the money was used legitimately and the allegations define too narrowly what a parliamentary assistant does.
  <br>
  <br>
  However judge Benedicte de Perthuis ruled: "It was established that all these people were actually working for the party, that their [European Union] lawmaker had not given them any tasks."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The investigations also showed that these were not administrative errors ... but embezzlement within the framework of a system put in place to reduce the party's costs."  (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's ruling junta declared a week of national mourning on Monday for the country's devastating earthquake, which has killed more than 1,700 people, as hopes faded of finding more survivors in the rubble of ruined buildings.
 <br>
  <br>
  National flags will fly at half-mast until April 6 "in sympathy for the loss of life and damages" from Friday's massive 7.7-magnitude quake, the junta said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the tempo and urgency of rescue efforts wound down in Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country's second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation is so dire that it's hard to express what is happening," said Aung Myint Hussein, chief administrator of Mandalay's Sajja North mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  People camped out in the streets across Mandalay overnight, either unable to return to ruined homes or nervous about the repeated aftershocks that rattled the city over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some had tents but many, including young children, simply bedded down on blankets in the middle of the roads, trying to keep as far from buildings as possible for fear of falling masonry.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,700 people are confirmed dead across Myanmar, according to the military junta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands more were injured and more than 300 remain missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 18 deaths have been confirmed hundreds of kilometres away in Bangkok, where the force of the quake caused a 30-storey tower block under construction to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, with communications down in much of Myanmar, the true scale of the disaster has yet to emerge and the death toll is expected to rise significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mandalay's 1,000-bed general hospital has been evacuated, with hundreds of patients being treated outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  With temperatures forecast to hit 40 degrees Celsius on Monday, patients lay on gurneys in the hospital car park, many with only a thin tarpaulin rigged up to shield them from the fierce tropical sun.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives did their best to comfort them, holding hands or waving bamboo fans over them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very, very imperfect condition for everyone," said one medic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're trying to do what we can here. We are trying our best."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sticky heat has exhausted rescue workers and accelerated body decomposition, which could complicate identification.
  <br>
  <br>
  But traffic began returning to the streets of Mandalay on Monday, and restaurants and street vendors resumed work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of Muslims gathered outside a destroyed mosque in the city for the first prayer of Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that follows the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aftershocks rattled Mandalay over the weekend, several times sending residents fleeing into the streets in brief moments of panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The challenges facing the Southeast Asian country of more than 50 million people were immense even before the earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar has been ravaged by four years of civil war sparked by a military coup in 2021, with its economy shattered and healthcare and infrastructure badly damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization declared the quake a top-level emergency as it urgently sought US$8 million to save lives and prevent disease outbreaks over the next 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has launched an appeal for more than US$100 million to help victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid and rescue teams have been arriving after junta chief Min Aung Hlaing made an exceptionally rare appeal for foreign assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past, isolated Myanmar's ruling generals have shunned foreign assistance, even after major natural disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun thanked key allies China and Russia for their help, as well as India, and said the authorities were doing their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Bangkok, rain fell on Monday morning at the site of the collapsed building, where diggers continued to clear the vast pile of rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say they have not given up hope of finding more survivors in the wreckage, where 11 deaths have been confirmed and at least 76 people are still unaccounted for. (AFP)

    US tariffs to target 'all countries'

<img alt="Donald Trump arrives back at the White House. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798259_1_20250331152712.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said the tariffs he plans to impose in the coming days would include "all countries," not just those with the largest trade imbalances with the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised a "Liberation Day" on Wednesday, when he is set to unveil reciprocal levies to address trade practices that his government deems unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You'd start with all countries, so let's see what happens," he said onboard Air Force One, dashing hopes he might scale back some of the threatened levies or that they would target a select group with persistent trade imbalances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't heard a rumor about 15 countries, 10 or 15," he said when asked which nations would be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been talking about all countries, not a cutoff."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's upcoming tariff salvo had been expected to target the 15 percent of partners that have persistent trade imbalances with the United States, a group Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called a "Dirty 15."
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite widening the target, the president insisted his tariffs would be more "generous" than those levied against the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tariffs will be far more generous than those countries were to us, meaning they will be kinder than those countries were to the United States of America over the decades," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They ripped us off like no country has ever been ripped off in history and we're going to be much nicer than they were to us.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it's substantial money for the country nevertheless."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has already slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and additional levies on imports from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tariffs on imported autos are also due to take effect on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's top trade aide Peter Navarro said the tax on auto imports could raise US$100 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And in addition, the other tariffs are going to raise about US$600 billion a year, about US$6 trillion over a 10-year period," Navarro said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's plans to unleash a wide range of reciprocal tariffs risk a global trade war, with other countries already vowing to retaliate and economists warning the sweeping moves risk stoking inflation and triggering a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has defended the levies as a way to raise government revenue and revitalize US industry. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police plan to question a 56-year-old man on suspicion of starting at least one of the wildfires that recently devastated the country’s southern regions, killing 30 people and burning through more than 48,000 hectares.
 <br>
  <br>
  The North Gyeongsang provincial police department said the unidentified man may have used fire to clear overgrown grass at a family grave on a hill in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the areas hardest hit by the wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police investigators examined the grave site on Monday and plan to question the man soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police department did not immediately say whether others would also be questioned over suspected links to the wildfires, which fire officials believe may have been sparked by multiple human errors, also including burning trash and sparks from welding work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fueled by dry and windy conditions, the wildfires raged for a week, destroying thousands of homes, and leaving mountains covered in ash, before firefighters, aided by rain, brought them under control on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30 people killed were mostly in their 60s or older.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during firefighting efforts and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 45 people were injured, including nine seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires damaged or destroyed more than 6,000 structures, including over 1,000 homes each in the southeastern city of Andong and the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, as well as more than 330 homes in Uiseong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires in Uiseong damaged about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, said to have been originally built in the seventh century.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them were two state-designated “treasures,” a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668 and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers from China have found six survivors so far in earthquake-rattled Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The China Search and Rescue Team plucked to safety three women and a girl on Monday morning in Mandalay. One of the women is pregnant.
  <br>
  <br>
  That raised to six the number of survivors found by Chinese rescuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 91 personnel from five civilian emergency response forces organised by the Ministry of Emergency Management have arrived in Myanmar and have been taking part in rescue operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the first batch of disaster-relief material offered by Beijing arrived in Myanmar on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar said one Chinese national was killed and 15 other Chinese citizens were injured in Friday's tremor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy said the Chinese diplomatic missions in Myanmar have been assisting the families of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,700 people were killed in the quake. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    Trump 'not joking' about bid for third term

<img alt="Donald Trump chats with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, left, on board Marine One upon arrival at the White House on Sunday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798236_1_20250331125457.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said “I’m not joking” about trying to serve a third term, the clearest indication he is considering ways to breach a constitutional barrier against continuing to lead the country after his second term ends at the beginning of 2029.
 <br>
  <br>
  “There are methods which you could do it,” he said in a telephone interview on Sunday with NBC News from Mar-a-Lago, his private club.
  <br>
  <br>
  He elaborated later to reporters on Air Force One from Florida to Washington that "I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged.” Trump lost that election to Democrat Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Trump added: “I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, we’ve got a long time to go.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22nd amendment, added to the Constitution in 1951 after President Franklin D Roosevelt was elected four times in a row, says “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Any attempt to remain in office would be legally suspect and it is unclear how seriously Trump might pursue the idea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments nonetheless were an extraordinary reflection of the desire to maintain power by a president who had violated democratic traditions four years ago when he tried to overturn the election he lost to Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy," said a statement from Rep. Daniel Goldman, a New York Democrat who served as lead counsel for Trump's first impeachment. "If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump’s ambitions for a third term.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Bannon, a former Trump strategist who runs the right-wing “War Room” podcast, called for the president to run again during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kayla Thompson, a 30-year-old former paralegal in Wisconsin, said she would “absolutely” like Trump to serve another term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “America needs him. America is headed in the right direction and, if he doesn’t do it, we’re probably headed backwards," said Thompson, who was attending a campaign event on Sunday with Elon Musk in Green Bay for a state Supreme Court race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Boston’s Northeastern University, said "there are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NBC's Kristen Welker asked Trump if one potential avenue to a third term was having Vice President JD Vance run for the top job and “then pass the baton to you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, that’s one,” Trump responded. “But there are others too. There are others.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Can you tell me another?” Welker asked.
  <br>
  <br>
  “No,” Trump replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, noted that the 12th amendment, which was ratified in 1804, says “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Muller said that indicates that if Trump is not eligible to run for president again because of the 22nd amendment, he is not eligible to run for vice president, either.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked whether he would want to keep serving in “the toughest job in the country” at that point.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, I like working,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump suggested that Americans would go along with a third term because of his popularity. He falsely claimed to have “the highest poll numbers of any Republican for the last 100 years.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Gallup data shows President George W Bush reaching a 90 percent approval rating after the attacks on September 11, 2001. His father, President George H.W. Bush, hit 89 percent following the Gulf War in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has maxed out at 47 percent in Gallup data during his second term, despite claiming to be "in the high 70s in many polls, in the real polls.” (AP)

    Duterte lawyer insists ICC 'has no jurisdiction'

<img alt="Friends and relatives of some of the thousands killed during former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's 'war on drugs' call for justice and his conviction by the International Criminal Court in Manila on Friday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798229_1_20250331121432.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodrigo Duterte's lead lawyer said there was a "compelling" argument to throw out the International Criminal Court case against the former Philippines president before it even comes to trial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nicholas Kaufman said in an interview in The Hague he hoped to stop the case before the ICC confirms the charges against Duterte by arguing the court cannot exercise its jurisdiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Philippines' withdrawal from the court had become effective well before an investigation was authorised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte, 80, faces a charge of crimes against humanity for murder over his "war on drugs" that claimed the lives of thousands of mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  British-Israeli lawyer Kaufman, 56, said: "Coming back to the jurisdictional point, obviously you don't need to be the dean of a law faculty to realise that that's going to be a huge issue at pre-trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that the jurisdictional argument is compelling as defence counsel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that it should succeed and I would be hugely disappointed if it doesn't succeed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to persuade the judges pre-trial that it [the court] cannot exercise its jurisdiction over the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There won't be a confirmation-of-charges hearing if the judges rule in our favour."
  <br>
  <br>
  A confirmation of charges hearing, where prosecutor and defence first lay out their evidence, is currently scheduled for September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The issue of jurisdiction is key in this case as the Philippines withdrew from the ICC in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, when the court issued its arrest warrant for Duterte, it noted that the alleged crimes took place while the country was still an ICC member.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the alleged conduct has taken place between 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019 on the territory of the Philippines, it falls within the court's jurisdiction," the ICC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC chief prosecutor's application for his arrest said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population" in the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The families of victims of his war on drugs see the ICC case as a long-awaited chance for justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another likely critical issue for the defence will be Duterte's arrest on March 11 and his rapid handover to the ICC in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I view it as a kidnapping, nothing more or less. It's an extrajudicial rendition. He was given no due process, just slung over to the Hague," Kaufman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was in complete contravention of Philippines law."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president's sudden detention came amid a spectacular deterioration in relations between the two most powerful families in Philippines politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Duterte and Marcos clans teamed up to win an election landslide in 2022 that saw Ferdinand Marcos become president and Sara Duterte, daughter of the imprisoned Rodrigo, vice-president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte has since been impeached on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Duterte "should have been brought before a judge before he was thrown onto a plane and dumped in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That didn't happen. As I've said already, this is a political hit job," said Kaufman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The politics in that country basically ended up in a situation where they needed to get him out of the picture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incumbent government did not want him in the picture anymore."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaufman said he was visiting his client virtually every day in the ICC detention centre, a couple of kilometres from the beach in the suburb of Scheveningen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was "adjusting to the reality of prison life. That's not easy for anyone," according to his lawyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the former president was in "good spirits," said Kaufman, whose previous clients at ICC include former Congolese rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba and Aisha Kadhafi, daughter of the deceased Libyan dictator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaufman said he was concerned that the ICC, currently under fire from all sides and even US sanctions, would be reluctant to give up such a high-profile case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My only fear is that this court is starved of cases at the present moment and might be loath to let a case like that go, to slip through its hands." (AFP)

    Venezuela says high-level criminal among US deportees

<img alt="Repatriation flight with migrants deported from the US lands in at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798190_1_20250331090008.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelan authorities reported the arrival on Sunday of a new flight of 175 migrants expelled by the United States, including a gang leader - the first time Caracas has confirmed a criminal was among the deportees.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has launched a crackdown on migrants since coming to power in January, deporting hundreds of people to Latin America that his administration has branded as "gangsters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the first time in these flights... someone of weight arrives who has been claimed by the Venezuelan justice system," said Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that the man was "not from Tren de Aragua," referring to the Venezuelan gang that Washington branded a "foreign terrorist organisation" and claims many of the deported Venezuelan migrants belong to.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabello received the migrants at the Maiquetia International Airport that serves Caracas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He belongs to a gang from Trujillo state, the gang... El Cagon," Cabello added, without offering further details on the criminal's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabello said that of the migrants received by Venezuela so far, none were members of Tren de Aragua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela and the United States broke off diplomatic relations in 2019, but had a rapprochement in January to agree on deportation flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  That cooperation was interrupted for a month after Washington cracked down on Venezuela's oil sector, but flights resumed a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday's flight was the third to land since the resumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  In total, 918 people have arrived in Venezuela after being deported from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 553 migrants have returned from Mexico, although it was unclear whether they were originally deported from US soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the United Nations, almost eight million Venezuelans have left their country, fleeing an economic crisis that began to show signs of recovery in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government claims that more than 1.2 million have returned. (AFP)

    Starmer, Trump discuss possible US-UK trade deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Keir Starmer and Donald Trump spoke on Sunday and had "productive" talks towards a UK-US trade deal, the British Prime Minister's Downing Street office said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since Britain's exit from the European Union at the start of the decade, successive UK governments have sought to strike a trade deal with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They discussed the productive negotiations between their respective teams on a UK-US economic prosperity deal, agreeing that these will continue at pace this week," a statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They agreed to stay in touch in the coming days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump himself has dangled the prospect of a "great" deal that could help the United Kingdom avoid, or at least soften, the blow caused by the tariffs the US president has promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike the EU, Britain has declined to retaliate against the tariffs already imposed on the country's steel industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the previous Conservative government did not manage to ink a deal in, Labour party leader Starmer came away from a Washington visit in late February hopeful of reaching an agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK is believed to want a trade deal ahead of Trump's so-called April 2 "Liberation Day", when he is set to unveil a range of tariffs for different trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  But any such accord is yet to see the light of day. (AFP)

    Myanmar quake a top-level emergency, says WHO

<img alt="Rescuers work at the site of a damaged building in Mandalay. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798187_1_20250331084335.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Sunday that the Myanmar earthquake was a top-level emergency as it urgently sought US$8 million to save lives and prevent disease outbreaks over the next 30 days.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said the high numbers of casualties and trauma injuries were at high risk of infection due to limited surgical capacity in the country, while the underlying conditions in Myanmar meant the quake was likely to intensify the risk of disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  "WHO has classified this crisis as a Grade 3 emergency - the highest level of activation under its Emergency Response Framework," the United Nations health agency said in its flash appeal for funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial 7.7-magnitude quake struck near the central Myanmar city of Mandalay on Friday, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake has killed more than 1,700 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in neighbouring Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar, "preliminary assessments indicate high numbers of casualties and trauma-related injuries, with urgent needs for emergency care. Electricity and water supplies remain disrupted, worsening access to health services and heightening risks of waterborne and food-borne disease outbreaks," the WHO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trauma-related injuries - including fractures, open wounds, and crush syndrome - are at high risk of infection and complications due to limited surgical capacity and inadequate infection prevention and control."
  <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said hospitals were overwhelmed, while the scale of deaths, injuries and damage to health facilities "are not yet fully understood".
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said displacement into overcrowded shelters, combined with the destruction of water systems and sanitation infrastructure, had sharply increased the risk of communicable disease outbreaks. (AFP)

    Actor Richard Chamberlain dies aged 90

File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798193_1_20250331091507.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Richard Chamberlain, the Emmy-nominated actor and 1960s heartthrob who rocketed to fame in the TV medical drama "Dr Kildare" and starred in the mini-series "Shogun" and "The Thorn Birds" has died at the age of 90, publicist Harlan Boll said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain died late on Saturday in Hawaii from complications from a stroke, he said in a statement on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain was an instant hit, and became a teen idol, as the handsome Dr James Kildare in the series that ran from 1961-1966. The Guardian newspaper said the then 27-year-old actor "looked like he had been sculpted by a loving god out of butter, honey and grace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The breakout role was the start of a six decade-career that spanned theatre, films and television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain was dubbed the "king of the mini-series" after appearing in several TV dramas in the 1980s and earned plaudits on stage in roles ranging from Professor Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady" and Captain von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" to Shakespeare's Hamlet and Richard II.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also was the original Jason Bourne in the 1988 mini-series "The Bourne Identity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "What's fascinating about Richard is that his range is enormous. His ability to be different each time out is what makes him such a valuable property," producer Susan Baerwald told the New York Times in 1988.
  <br>
  <br>
  The versatile actor was nominated for four Emmys -- as an English navigator in 17th century Japan in "Shogun" (1981), a love-torn priest in "The Thorn Birds" (1983), Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg in "Wallenberg: A Hero's Story" (1985) and for the title role in the 1975 TV movie "The Count of Monte-Cristo."
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of his roles were as romantic leading men, which is why he did not publicly reveal he was a homosexual until he was 68 years old. He feared it would ruin his career. For much of his life he said he pretended to be someone else. "When you grow up in the ’30s, ’40s and ’50s being gay, it's not only ain't easy, it's just impossible,” he told the New York Times in 2014. "I assumed there was something terribly wrong with me. And even becoming famous and all that, it was still there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain said it was a tremendous relief after he acknowledged his sexuality in his 2003 autobiography "Shattered Love: A Memoir."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had no fear left," he said in a 2019 interview. "It was a wonderful experience. People were open, friendly and sweet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born George Richard Chamberlain on March 31, 1934, in Los Angeles, he was the youngest of two sons. He had hoped to be an artist but switched to acting after attending Pomona College in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  His acting career was put on hold when he was drafted into the US Army in 1956 and served in Korea. After his discharge, Chamberlain returned to Los Angeles, where he co-founded a theatre group and had small parts on TV before becoming Dr Kildare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The success of the TV show led to a brief singing career and film roles opposite Julie Christie in "Petulia" (1968) and "The Madwoman of Chaillot" (1969) with Katherine Hepburn. He had a brief run in the musical "Breakfast at Tiffany's" with Mary Tyler Moore. The show closed after four previews.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the late 1960s, Chamberlain moved to England where he honed his acting skills in the BBC series "The Portrait of a Lady" and as Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dr Kildare was a huge hit in England, and I heard that all the London reviewers were coming to rip this interloper to pieces," he said in an interview. "But we got very good reviews."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain returned to the big screen as Lord Byron in the drama "Lady Caroline Lamb" (1972), "The Three Musketeers" (1973) and as a villain in the disaster film "The Towering Inferno" (1974).
  <br>
  <br>
  Throughout his career he mixed roles in Broadway plays, including Tennessee Williams' "The Night of the Iguana," with musicals, TV and films.
  <br>
  <br>
  After coming out publicly, he played both gay and straight characters in TV shows including "Brothers & Sisters," "Will & Grace" and "Desperate Housewives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The actor released a book of haiku poetry in 2012 and narrated Audubon environmental television specials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain lived in Hawaii for many years and had a three-decade relationship with actor and writer Martin Rabbett, his co-star in the 1986 adventure film "Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold." The couple parted in 2010 but remained close friends.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us. How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul," Rabbett said in a statement. (Reuters)

    Trump threatens Iran with bombings and tariffs

<img alt="In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said US and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798156_2_20250331075407.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with bombings and secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said US and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing," Trump said. "But there's a chance that if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's language represented a sharpening of his comment a few days earlier that if Tehran refused to negotiate a new nuclear agreement, "bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran."
  <br>
  <br>
  Western powers accuse Iran of having an clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran says its nuclear programme is wholly for civilian energy purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump in 2018 pulled the United States out of an agreement to relieve sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, in his second term, he has said he is open to talks on a new deal that could reduce the risk of military escalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump revealed in early March that he had sent a letter proposing such talks to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran, deeply suspicious of the US administration after Trump's withdrawal from the original nuclear deal, has refused to negotiate directly with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the official IRNA news agency that he had delivered a letter responding to Trump's outreach to Oman, which has served as an intermediary in the past. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The toll from Myanmar's earthquake continued to rise on Sunday, as foreign rescue teams and aid rushed into the country where hospitals were overwhelmed and some communities scrambled to mount rescue efforts with limited resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar's strongest in a century, struck on Friday, leaving around 1,700 people dead, 3,400 injured and over 300 missing as of Sunday, the military government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, warned that the number of fatalities could go up and his administration faced a challenging situation, state media reported, three days after he made a rare call for international assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  India, China and Thailand are among Myanmar's neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The destruction has been extensive, and humanitarian needs are growing by the hour," the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With temperatures rising and the monsoon season approaching in just weeks, there is an urgent need to stabilise affected communities before secondary crises emerge."

  <br>
  The United States pledged US$2 million in aid "through Myanmar-based humanitarian assistance organisations" and said in a statement that an emergency response team from USAID, which is undergoing massive cuts under the Trump administration, is deploying to Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critical infrastructure – including bridges, highways, airports and railways – across the country of 55 million lie damaged, slowing humanitarian efforts while the conflict that has battered the economy, displaced over 3.5 million people and debilitated the health system rages on.
  <br>
  <br>
  In some areas near the epicentre, residents said government assistance was scarce, leaving people to fend for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is necessary to restore the transportation routes as soon as possible," Min Aung Hlaing told officials on Saturday, according to state media. "It is necessary to fix the railways and also reopen the airports so that rescue operations would be more effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Service's predictive modelling estimated Myanmar's death toll could eventually top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country's annual economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including the second-biggest city, Mandalay, and the capital Naypyitaw, were struggling to cope with an influx of injured people, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake also shook parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 18 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 76 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed Bangkok building, where rescue operations continued for a third day, using drones and sniffer dogs to hunt for survivors. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Demonstrators descended on Tesla dealerships across the United States and in Europe and Canada on Saturday to protest company chief Elon Musk, who has amassed extraordinary power as a top advisor to US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Waving signs with messages like "Musk is stealing our money" and "Reclaim our country," the protests largely took place peacefully following fiery episodes of vandalism on Teslas in recent weeks that US officials have denounced as "terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds rallied Saturday outside the Tesla dealership in New York's Manhattan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some blasted Musk, the world's richest man, while others demanded the shuttering of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is dramatically slashing the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amy Neifeld, a 70-year-old psychologist who had not joined a protest since marching against the Vietnam War in the 1970s, accused Musk of leading the country toward fascism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm Jewish, so I grew up with a great awareness of fascism," she told AFP. "And it has just gotten uglier and uglier" since Trump returned to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He acts like he's the vice president," said New York protester Eva Mueller of musk. "He's dismantling, actively, our government, he's dismantling our democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The protest was organized by the environmental activist group Planet Over Profit, which argues "stopping Musk will help save lives and protect our democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington's posh Georgetown neighbourhood, some 150 people gathered in a festive mood on an unseasonably warm day, dancing and cheering as passing cars honked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests also took place in Florida, Massachusetts and California, as well as in in European cities such as London, Berlin and Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Canada's Vancouver, where around one hundred people protested at a Tesla dealership, one person in a dinosaur costume held a placard that said, "You thought the Nazis were extinct? Don't buy a Swasticar."
  <br>
  <br>
  A small group of Americans held signs outside a Tesla dealership in the French capital, including one that read "Send Musk to Mars now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and Trump "are destroying our democracy, not obeying the basic rules of our country, and firing people at agencies that do very important work," said Raf, 59, a Paris protester who did not wish to give his last name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for reaction to the protests, Tesla did not immediately respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acts of vandalism against Tesla vehicles, dealerships and other facilities have spread for weeks, in protest both against Musk's ruthless job-cutting work, and what has been seen as his unwelcome interference in politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Attorney General Pam Bondi has denounced the attacks on Tesla as "domestic terrorism." (AFP)

    Mexico brings in junk food ban

<img alt="A man walks past a sign that refers to the labelling of products, in the subway of Mexico City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798081_1_20250330075336.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world’s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The health guidelines, first published last fall , take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavoured peanuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: “Farewell, junk food!” And it encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexico's ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogramme the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic .
  <br>
  <br>
  In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , has vowed to upend the nation's food system and “ Make America Healthy Again " by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labelling system in 2020 .
  <br>
  <br>
  Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,” said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum , who has championed the effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexico’s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to Unicef, which classifies the nation’s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40 percent of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from US$545 to US$5,450.
  <br>
  <br>
  But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico’s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains and even reliable internet and electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese restaurant chain Sukiya will temporarily shut nearly all of its roughly 2,000 branches after a rat was found in a miso soup and a bug was found in another meal, the company said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sukiya, famous for its beef bowls, apologised in a statement saying a bug contamination at one of its Tokyo restaurants on Friday, two months after the rat incident at another branch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sukiya has decided to temporarily close all restaurants, with the exception of some stores in shopping centres, from March 31 to April 4 in order to take measures against pests and vermin," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fast-food company has about 1,970 stores across Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nikkei business daily reported that its stores in shopping centres will also be closed as soon as arrangements are made with the facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Food recalls are rare in Japan, a country with famously high sanitation standards, but food poisoning and recall incidents occasionally make headlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, more than 100,000 packets of sliced bread were recalled after parts of a rat were discovered inside two bags. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean firefighters deployed helicopters on Saturday as the country's biggest wildfires on record that ravaged wide areas of its southeast reignited in one of the region's cities, an official said.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen fires have been fanned by high winds and dry conditions, killing 30 people and injuring dozens more in southeastern regions, an interior ministry official said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fires were whipped up again early on Saturday in Andong, a city in the worst-hit North Gyeongsang province, forcing authorities to deploy eight helicopters to the area, said an official from the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came a day after the main fire in the province, where 26 of the 30 victims have died, was extinguished.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems that the remaining embers have flared up a bit," said the official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We plan to deploy more helicopters to the area in Andong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires there began on Saturday last week and rolled on for days.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 2,900 homes in the region have been completely destroyed, according to the latest figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official said this week that more than 35,000 hectares (86,500 acres) of forest have been burned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire also destroyed several historic sites, including the Gounsa temple complex in the southeastern city of Uiseong, which is believed to have been originally built in the 7th century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extent of the damage makes it South Korea's largest-ever wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Saturday, an official from the North Gyeongsang provincial government said helicopters were still being deployed in Andong areas to extinguish mostly small flames and smoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the size of the area, it may take some time to complete all operations and fully extinguish the fires," said Do Gyu-myeong .
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the victims in the region were elderly, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those killed include a pilot in his 70s whose helicopter crashed on Wednesday while he was trying to contain a fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flames have been fanned by high winds and ultra-dry conditions, with the area experiencing below-average rains for months after South Korea had its hottest year on record in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said the wildfires were accidentally started by a grave visitor and "sparks from a brush cutter."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Hye-young, a 65-year-old resident of Andong, said she still remains traumatised by the experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was really scary to see the sparks flying around all at once," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While living in North Gyeongsang, I never thought that such a large disaster would strike us." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from the massive earthquake in Myanmar has passed 1,600, the ruling junta there said on Saturday, with more than 3,400 injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the junta's information team said 1,644 people are known to have died in Friday's shallow 7.7-magnitude quake, with 3,408 injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has extended condolences to Myanmar's leader, and a rescue team from Yunnan Province – that borders Myanmar – arrived on Saturday morning at Yangon in Myanmar to provide assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said the only highway linking Myanmar's Yangon in the south and central Naypyidaw and Mandalay was severely damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar in the early afternoon on Friday, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake destroyed buildings, downed bridges, and buckled roads across swathes of Myanmar, with severe damage reported in the second-biggest city, Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 10 more deaths have so far been confirmed in Bangkok, where rescuers laboured through the night searching for workers trapped when a 30-storey skyscraper under construction collapsed, reduced in seconds to a pile of rubble and twisted metal by the force of the shaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the biggest quake to hit Myanmar in over a century, according to US geologists, and the tremors were powerful enough to severely damage buildings across Bangkok, hundreds of kilometres away from the epicentre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to 100 workers were still unaccounted for at the building, close to the Chatuchak weekend market that is a magnet for tourists. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An original animatronic model of the iconic alien created for Steven Spielberg's classic 1982 film "ET the Extra-Terrestrial" is for sale at Sotheby's and is estimated to fetch as much as US$900,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Created by Oscar-winning special effects artist Carlo Rambaldi, the model is one of three used in the film and is specifically the one featured in the closet scene when ET is hiding among loads of stuffed animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The model - which stands 91.4 centimetres tall, according to Sotheby's listing - is from the personal collection of Rambaldi, an animatronics pioneer who died in 2012.
  <br>
  <br>
  The starting bid is US$500,000 in the online sale, which closes on April 3. The estimated price is from US$600,000 to US$900,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This model embodies the artistry of an era before CGI took hold, a nostalgic and iconic piece of Hollywood history as captivating as the stories themselves," said Cassandra Hatton, a Sotheby's vice president.

    Trump, Carney hail 'extremely productive' call

<img alt="During the call, Carney told Trump his government would impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods from April 2. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797975_1_20250329071156.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said he had an "extremely productive" first call Friday with Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney, after soaring tensions over tariffs and Trump's wish to annex his northern neighbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump added that the two planned to meet soon after Canada's April 28 general election in which Carney - who took office two weeks ago - has made standing up to the US president the focus of his campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just finished speaking with Prime Minister Mark Carney, of Canada. It was an extremely productive call, we agree on many things," Trump said on his Truth Social network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Typically, a new Canadian leader makes a phone call with the US president an immediate priority, but this was Trump and Carney's first contact since the Canadian was sworn in on March 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's office said the pair had a "very constructive conversation" and agreed to begin "comprehensive negotiations about a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added, however, that Carney told Trump his government would impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods from April 2, when sweeping US levies are set to come into place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're not going to back down, we're going to respond with force," Carney said at an afternoon press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What is clear is that the relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. And we're not the one's who changed," he added, confirming that Canada needed to look to Europe "to strengthen ties with reliable partners."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the coming weeks, months and years, we must fundamentally reimagine our economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's glowing post was still a dramatic change in tone from recent rhetoric between Washington and Ottawa, who are Nato allies and long-standing economic partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has sparked fury in Canada by repeatedly insisting it should become the 51st US state and by slapping or threatening tariffs on the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  His post on Friday was notable for its diplomacy, as Trump gave Carney his official title of prime minister and made no reference to his annexation drive. (AFP)

    Vance accuses Denmark of underinvesting in Greenland

<img alt="US Vice President JD Vance demanded Denmark change its approach as President Trump pushes to take over the Danish territory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797969_1_20250329062730.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance accused Denmark on Friday of not having done enough to protect Greenland when he visited the resource-rich Danish territory coveted by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vance made his comment during a trip to the Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, a visit viewed by Copenhagen and Nuuk as a provocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our message to Denmark is basic: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland," Vance told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump argues that the United States needs the vast Arctic island for national and international security and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not talking about peace for the United States. We are talking about world peace. We are talking about international security," Trump claimed to reporters at the White House on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the potential use of force, Vance stressed that the US administration did not think it was "ever going to be necessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen hit back at Vance in a statement to Danish media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For many years, we have stood by the Americans in very difficult situations," she said, referring to Danish combat deployments alongside American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Vice President's reference to Denmark is not accurate," she said, expressing her readiness to "cooperate day and night with the Americans" on Arctic security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance was accompanied by his wife, Usha; National Security Advisor Mike Waltz; Energy Secretary Chris Wright; Utah Senator Mike Lee; and former Homeland Security Advisor Julia Nesheiwat, who is Waltz's wife.
  <br>
  <br>
  A majority of Greenlanders oppose US annexation, according to a January poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's desire to take over the ice-covered territory, which is seeking independence from Denmark, has been categorically rejected by Greenlanders, their politicians and Danish officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  While all of Greenland's political parties favour independence, none of them support the idea of becoming part of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new broad four-party coalition government was announced in Greenland just hours before the US delegation's arrival, following elections earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Incoming prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said the territory needed unity at this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is critical that we put aside our disagreements and differences... because only in this way will we be able to cope with the heavy pressure we are exposed to from outside," he said when he unveiled his government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nielsen said that by visiting Greenland when there was no government in office there, the US administration was "not showing respect to an ally". (AFP)

 The earthquake in Myanmar was felt in China's Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and caused injuries and damage to houses in the city of Ruili on the border with northern Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Videos that one outlet said it had received from a person in Ruili showed building debris littering a street and a person being wheeled on a stretcher toward an ambulance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shaking in Mangshi, a Chinese city about 100 kilometres northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people couldn’t stand, one resident told The Paper, an online media outlet. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A major hospital in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw is a "mass casualty area" after the country was rocked by a huge earthquake, an official at the facility said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rows of wounded were treated outside the emergency department of the 1,000-bed general hospital, some writhing in pain, others lying still as relatives sought to comfort them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The entrance of the emergency department at the city's main hospital pancaked onto a car.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hospital official said that "this is a mass casualty area."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another official said hundreds of injured people had arrived at the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't seen [anything] like this before," a doctor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are trying to handle the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so exhausted now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The route to the hospital was jammed with vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ambulance tried to make its way through, a paramedic shouting "cars, move aside so the ambulance can get through."
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake damaged religious shrines, sending parts and some homes toppling to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the National Museum in Yangon, pieces fell from the ceiling as the building began shaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uniformed staff ran outside, some trembling and tearful, others grabbing cellphones to try to contact loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of the former royal palace and buildings were damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the area is prone to earthquakes, it is generally sparsely populated, and most houses are low-rise structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Sagaing region just southwest of Mandalay, the 90-year-old Ava Bridge collapsed, and some sections of the highway connecting Mandalay and Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, were also damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents in Yangon rushed out of their homes when the quake struck. There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A strong 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit central Myanmar on Friday, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said, buckling roads in the capital Naypyidaw and with tremors felt in China and Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok police say a 30-storey building under construction for government offices collapsed when the earthquake hit around midday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medics say at least 43 workers are trapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic video circulating on social media showed the multi-storey building with a crane on top collapsing into a cloud of dust, while onlookers screamed and ran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were responding to the collapse, which happened near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak Market, but had no immediate information on how many workers were on the site at the time of the collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tremor's epicentre was located 16 kilometres northwest of the city of Sagaing at a depth of 10 kilometres around 12:50 pm, the USGS said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some metro and light rail services were suspended in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's stock exchange said on it is on "full halt."
  <br>
  <br>
  The midday temblor was followed by a strong 6.4 magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roads were buckled by the force of the tremors and chunks of ceilings fell from buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt through northern Thailand and down to the capital Bangkok, where residents ran into the streets as buildings shook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I heard it and I was sleeping in the house, I ran as far as I could in my pyjamas out of the building," said Duangjai, a resident of the popular northern tourist city Chiang Mai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt in Yunnan province, according to Beijing's quake agency, which said the jolt measured 7.9 in magnitude. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's junta chief Min Aung Hlaing will join a regional leaders' summit in Thailand next week where he is seeking high-level bilateral meetings, said three sources with direct knowledge, in a rare visit to a Southeast Asian country since seizing power in coup that led to a civil war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Min Aung Hlaing is the subject of widespread western sanctions and is barred from attending summits of the Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN due to the Myanmar military's failure to implement an agreed peace plan with the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will join the April 3-4 summit in Bangkok of the BIMSTEC grouping of mostly South Asian countries, where the Myanmar delegation is seeking bilateral meetings with leaders and top officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meetings being sought include ones with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of Bangladesh’s interim government, Muhammed Yunus, the sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have been reaching out asking for meetings," one of the sources said, referring to Myanmar officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar has been in crisis since the military overthrew the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking mass protests that escalated into an armed rebellion against the junta.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a third of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta chief said on Thursday said an election would be held in December, promising a free and fair vote and to transfer state power to the winning party. (Reuters)

<img alt="Relatives of drug war and extrajudicial killing victims in Quezon City watch a live telecast of the initial appearance of Rodrigo Duterte at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797846_1_20250328130849.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Family and supporters of former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte will rally on Friday to mark his 80th birthday and protest his detention in The Hague on a charge of crimes against humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Duterte could spend the rest of his life in jail if convicted at the International Criminal Court (ICC) of the charge tied to his "war on drugs" in which thousands were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters are planning more than 200 simultaneous birthday rallies demanding his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, his eldest daughter, has been in the Dutch city for more than two weeks helping assemble his legal team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another of the ex-president's daughters, 20-year-old Veronica as well as her mother, Cielito Avancena, said they failed to get inside the prison to see him on Wednesday – but remained hopeful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will make sure I get to see him," Veronica told a Philippine television network outside the ICC detention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another of the ex-president's sons is expected, as well as his ex-wife Elizabeth Zimmerman, according to Sara Duterte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC chief prosecutor's application for his arrest said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population" in the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's arrest on March 11 and rapid handover to the international tribunal came on the heels of his family's bitter falling out with his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cracks began to appear in their alliance soon after Marcos teamed up with Sara Duterte to sweep the presidential and vice presidential elections in May 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president quit her cabinet post as education secretary after being denied the defence portfolio, while Duterte himself began calling Marcos a drug addict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Sara Duterte was impeached by a pro-Marcos House of Representatives on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outcome of her Senate trial will likely depend on the number of seats her allies win in May 12 mid-term elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of her party's candidates, former Philippine police chief and drug war enforcer Ronald Dela Rosa, says he expects to be arrested by the ICC next.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ex-president faces a six-month wait inside the United Nations' Scheveningen prison before his next scheduled court appearance on September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is only allowed two visits per day – a lawyer and a family member, said the vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I urged him to write a book and then when you get out, we'll sell it and make money out of it," she said. (AFP)

    Rubio says too early for high-level Russia talks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned on Thursday it was premature to expect high-level talks with Russia, while the United States weighs Moscow's response to Washington's efforts to end the Ukraine war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Asked by a reporter if it was time for higher-level talks after indirect US negotiations with the two sides in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said: "I think you have to make more progress on a technical level."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of work to be done with both sides, particularly with the Russian side, which we haven't talked to for years," Rubio said on his plane to his home city of Miami from a three-nation Caribbean tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  On how long it would take to make progress, Rubio said, "I just can't put a timeframe on that because it doesn't depend on us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said US President Donald Trump's administration would hold consultations to discuss the outcome of the meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has repeatedly said he hopes to meet soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin, likely in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States announced on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine had agreed to hold fire in strikes on the Black Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Russia later said it had conditions, as it seeks relief from the sweeping sanctions imposed by the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio had earlier called on Russia to accept unconditionally a Ukrainian-backed proposal for a 30-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron has rejected Russian calls for an easing of Western sanctions, saying it was far too early and more progress was needed. (AFP)

    Rubio warns Venezuela against Guyana attacks

<img alt="Guyanese President Mohamed Irfaan Ali, left, with Marco Rubio in Georgetown, Guyana. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797818_1_20250328105815.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Marco Rubio bluntly warned Venezuela against attacking its oil-rich neighbour Guyana, brandishing the power of the US military to protect the small South American nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela, whose leftist leader Nicolas Maduro is despised by the Cuban-American Rubio, has increasingly pushed its claim to the disputed Essequibo region controlled by Guyana, and was accused this month of making an incursion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have full confidence saying it now as secretary of state – there will be consequences for adventurism. There will be consequences for aggressive action," Rubio said in Guyana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what the United States would do if Venezuela attacked ExxonMobil oil projects in Guyana, Rubio said: "It would be a very bad day -- a very bad week for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stopping short of spelling out a military response, Rubio said: "We have a big navy, and it can get almost anywhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Maduro responded angrily to the threat, calling Rubio an "imbecile" and saying "no one threatens Venezuela."
  <br>
  <br>
  While in Guyana, Rubio signed an agreement to boost security cooperation with the country including through greater information sharing. It comes years after Guyana and the United States agreed to joint maritime patrols.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyanese President Irfaan Ali welcomed the stance of Rubio, who called Venezuela's claims "illegitimate."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very pleased at the reassurance of the US, ensuring the safeguard of our territorial integrity and sovereignty," Ali said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement on Telegram, said his country did "not need nor seek conflicts, but neither will we allow foreign interests to try to rewrite the reality about our Essequibo."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get your noses out of this dispute!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyana, an English-speaking former British and Dutch colony where the majority of the 800,000 people still live in poverty, has for years had a long-shot movement that has sought to join the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such formal accession was not on the agenda, but Trump has made no secret of his passion for expansionism in the Western Hemisphere, even at the expense of traditional alliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Exxon has dominated the oil industry, China has made rapid inroads in Guyana with infrastructure projects including an expansion of the international airport where Rubio landed. (AFP)

    Trump pulls UN envoy nomination amid Congress fears

<img alt="Donald Trump with US Representative Elise Stefanik last year. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797812_1_20250328104043.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump withdrew right-wing firebrand Elise Stefanik as his nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations as Republicans fear for their narrow majority in Congress.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New York congresswoman is just the second Trump cabinet pick not to go through, after Matt Gaetz pulled out of the running to be attorney general following allegations of sexual misconduct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik is a vocal Trump ally and pro-Israel stalwart.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat" in the House of Representatives, Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said it was "essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had asked Stefanik to stay in Congress and "rejoin the House leadership team," although he did not say in what capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans won both the House and Senate in the November 2024 election that returned Trump to the White House, but they have a very tight lead in the lower chamber.
  <br>
  <br>
  They control the House by 218 seats to 213, giving them just a tiny margin and making it difficult to pass key legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two crucial special elections will be held in Florida on April 1 to fill the seats vacated by Mike Waltz, who is now Trump's national security advisor, and Gaetz.
  <br>
  <br>
  While both Republicans comfortably won the seats in November, polling in one of the districts has shown the Democratic candidate closing the gap considerably.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump himself has leaned into the races, with an appearance Thursday at a candidate's online event seen as evidence that Republicans are worried.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those concerns were further heightened on Tuesday, when a special election for Pennsylvania's state senate saw Democrats flip a district that Trump won handily last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik has effectively been in limbo since Trump's nomination, keeping her place in the House for a number of key votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A firebrand who was considered a moderate before the Trump era, Stefanik is seen as one of the most vocal supporters in Congress of both Israel and US Jewish causes. (AFP)

    Light rain aids firefighters in South Korea

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Light rain offered some relief to South Korean authorities tackling the country's worst wildfires on record, with exhausted firefighters making another push on Friday to contain blazes stretching 70 km.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 28 people have died and more than 45,000 hectares of largely forest land in the country's southeast have been charred or are burning, as strong winds have driven blazes from central Uiseong county to coastal regions over the past week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uiseong reported fires had been put out in 95 percent of the area as of early Friday, and flames in 85 percent of the neighbouring Andong city, which is home to UNESCO World Heritage sites, have been doused, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeongdeok county on the east coast, where the fire spread from the initial blaze more than 70 km away in under 12 hours, was still fighting to contain the flames, with nearly a third of the area still ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rain of less than 3 mm fell in some parts of the regions on Thursday and had offered "a little help," forest service spokesman Kim Jong-gun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters and helicopters were taking advantage of more favourable weather and better visibility to make a push to make more progress before winds are expected to pick up later on Friday, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blazes that began in Uiseong have become the biggest single forest fire in South Korea's history, destroying an area equivalent to about two-thirds of the island of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 80 helicopters started flying at daybreak on Friday to dump water, the safety ministry said. A helicopter pilot died on Wednesday after crashing while trying to tackle a blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wildfires have displaced more than 30,000 residents, many of whom are elderly, and ravaged everything in their path, including historic temples and homes, in the mountainous forest regions of North Gyeongsang province. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arctic sea ice had its weakest winter buildup since record-keeping began 47 years ago, a symptom of climate change that will have repercussions globally, scientists said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Arctic reaches its maximum sea ice in March each year and then starts a six-month melt season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Snow and Ice Data Centre said the peak measurement taken on Saturday was 14.33 million square kilometres - about 80,000 square kilometres smaller than the lowest previous peak in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Warming temperatures are what’s causing the ice to decline,'' ice data scientist Walt Meier said. “You know, sea ice in particular is very sensitive... 31 degrees is ice skating and 33 degrees it’s swimming.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists said warming conditions in the Arctic - the region is warming four times faster than the rest of the world - affect weather elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The warming winter atmosphere above the Arctic Circle does impact large-scale weather patterns that do influence those of us outside the Arctic,” said Julienne Stroeve, an ice scientist at the University of Manitoba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the smaller sea ice, Stroeve noted that not only was there less of it, the remaining ice was thin enough for more of it to melt quickly this summer. She cautioned that a record low area in the winter didn't guarantee a record small area in the summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Melting Arctic sea ice - mostly in the summer - is making the polar bear population smaller, weaker and hungrier because they rely on the sea ice to hunt from, scientists said. And winter sea ice is especially important for fisheries and seal pups, Meier said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arctic sea ice's biggest year since record-keeping began was 1979, at 16.64 million square kilometres. That means since satellites began tracking it, Arctic sea ice's winter peak has shrunk by about the size of Pakistan. (AP)

    Australian PM calls general election for May 3

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia will hold a general election on May 3, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday, locking in a showdown over climate action, nuclear power and a runaway housing market.
 <br>
  <br>
  Albanese's centre-left Labour party took office in May 2022, turfing out a conservative government deeply unpopular after almost a decade in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  But initial enthusiasm for Albanese, 62, has evaporated in recent months as the government nears the end of its three-year term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls show him neck-and-neck with right-leaning Peter Dutton, 54, a hard-nosed former detective who wants to cut back on immigration and reverse a ban on nuclear power.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the last few years, the world has thrown a lot at Australia in uncertain times," the prime minister told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because of the strength and resilience that our people have shown, Australia is turning the corner. Now, on May 3, you choose the way forward."
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese declared he was "born ready" to deal with climate challenges, tariff turmoil and the long tail of inflation.

  And he warned any foreign foes intent on meddling in the election campaign to "back off".

  Albanese's government has embraced the global push towards decarbonisation, warning of a future in which iron ore and polluting coal exports no longer prop up the economy. (AFP)

 Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday he would call a general election "imminently," with local media reporting the poll would be held on May 3.
 <br>
  <br>
  Albanese's left-leaning Labor government is nearing the end of its three-year term and must hold an election by May 17 at the latest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recent polls show the government is neck-and-neck with its conservative rivals, who were turfed out in 2022 after almost a decade in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  As speculation mounted on Thursday, Albanese said he was preparing to call the election "soon."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be called pretty imminently," he told a local radio station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Multiple media outlets – including national broadcaster ABC – reported Albanese would announce the official start of campaigning on Friday, setting an election date of May 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 62-year-old's government released its annual budget this week, courting votes with surprise tax cuts and a raft of other sweeteners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conservative leader Peter Dutton, 54, has pilloried Albanese, accusing him of "weak" leadership and stoking inflation through government largesse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutton's signature policy is a US$200 billion scheme to construct seven industrial-scale nuclear reactors, putting the brakes on the growth of renewable energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polling shows economic concerns and the high cost of housing will dominate the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although inflation has eased under Albanese – from 7.8 percent in 2022 to 2.4 percent in December – many households are still struggling with high food, fuel, and power prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major cities Sydney and Melbourne now rank among the 10 least-affordable housing markets in the world, according to the annual Demographia affordability index. (AFP)
