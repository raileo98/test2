<div class="itemFullText">
 At least seven people were killed on Monday when a small plane crashed into the sea while taking off from the Honduras Caribbean island of Roatan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major Wilmer Guerrero of the country's fire department told reporters 10 people were retrieved from the site of the crash, six of whom were pronounced dead at the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  A crew member's body was then found floating in the sea near the plane, which crashed about a kilometre from the coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials gave conflicting reports on the number of people on board the plane -- either 17 or 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guerrero said one of the passengers, a 40-year-old French citizen, would be transferred to a hospital in the city of San Pedro Sula on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lanhsa airlines plane took off at nightfall from Roatan, one of the Bay Islands, and one of Honduras' main tourist destinations, heading for the port of La Ceiba, on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The plane almost fell on us. I was fishing," a fisherman told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honduran President Xiomara Castro said she had "immediately activated" an emergency committee made up of the armed forces, firefighters, and others to assist the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash was caused by an "apparent mechanical failure" on the British-made Jetstream 41, police said in a statement. (AFP)

    Scores dead in new Israeli strikes against Hamas

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched new strikes against Hamas on Tuesday and promised "increasing military force" after talks on further hostage releases stalled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Ministry in Gaza said at least 200 people were killed and another 150 were wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he instructed the military to take "strong action" against Hamas in Gaza in response to the group's refusal to release hostages and rejection of all ceasefire proposals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength," the prime minister's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes come after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the 17-month long war where dozens of hostages were released for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior Hamas official accused Israel of unilaterally overturning the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Hamas said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin "Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Three houses were hit in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, a building in Gaza City, and targets in Khan Younis and Rafah, according to medics and witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab mediators, backed by the United States, haven't been able to hammer out differences between the two warring parties in talks held over the past two weeks. (Agencies)

    MMA star Conor McGregor meets Trump at White House

<img alt="Irish UFC fighter Conor McGregor stands at the briefing room lectern with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796184_1_20250318092653.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Irish mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor, who has been found liable of sexual assault, met Donald Trump during a Saint Patrick's Day visit on Monday during which he lashed out at illegal immigration in Ireland.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Ireland is at the cusp of potentially losing its Irishness," said McGregor during an appearance in the White House briefing room alongside the US president's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The illegal immigration racket is running ravage on the country," added the fighter, wearing a green business suit to mark Saint Patrick's Day, the centuries-old celebration of his homeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later hosted the 36-year-old former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) star - whom he said last week was his favourite Irishman - in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor posed for a picture with his arm around Trump's shoulder as the president sat at his desk, and for another with tech tycoon and powerful Trump advisor Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla billionaire Musk previously backed McGregor when he spoke in the past about a possible presidential bid in Ireland. Musk has recently spoken out in support of a number of anti-immigration parties in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Your work ethic is inspiring," McGregor told Trump, according to footage posted by an aide to the US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yours is too, you're fantastic," replied Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor had earlier said he would be "listening" to Trump on immigration - one of the US president's main focus areas as he seeks to ramp up deportations of people without proper documentation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We couldn't think of a better guest to have with us on Saint Patrick's Day," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor's comments earned swift pushback from Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, who met with Trump last week in the White House and received a dressing down over trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Conor McGregor's remarks are wrong, and do not reflect the spirit of St Patrick's Day, or the views of the people of Ireland," the premier posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a sport that combines various combat techniques, and can be extremely violent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been gaining popularity, particularly as Trump campaigned in 2024 with stars and promoters of the UFC series that is popular with many male voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicknamed "The Notorious," McGregor is one of the biggest stars in UFC, the most famous and lucrative MMA league. He is known for his aggressive, provocative temperament and noted for occasional anti-immigration outbursts.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November 2024 the fighter was ordered by an Irish court to pay damages to a woman who claimed that McGregor "brutally raped and battered" her in a hotel in Dublin in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor claimed they had consensual sex.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, the Irishman was sued in a US court in January, accused of sexual assault at an NBA game in Miami in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was meanwhile ordered by a New York jury in a civil trial in 2023 to pay US$5 million for sexually abusing and defaming writer E Jean Carroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump denied the allegations and appealed the verdict, which was upheld in December 2024. (AFP)

    Stranded astronauts set to return after nine months

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than nine months aboard the International Space Station, a pair of astronauts are finally set to depart for Earth early Tuesday, ending a prolonged mission that has captivated global attention.
 <br>
  <br>
  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams flew to the orbital lab in June last year, on what was supposed to be a days-long roundtrip to test out Boeing's Starliner on its first crewed flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the spaceship developed propulsion problems and was deemed unfit to fly them back, instead returning empty without more major problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ex-Navy pilots Wilmore and Williams, 62 and 59 respectively, were instead re-assigned to the Nasa-SpaceX Crew-9 mission, which saw a Dragon spacecraft fly to the ISS last September with a team of two, rather than the usual four, to make room for the "stranded" pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, early Sunday, a relief team called Crew-10 docked with the station, their arrival met with broad smiles and hugs as they floated through the hatch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crew-10's arrival clears the way for Wilmore and Williams to depart, along with American Nick Hague and Russian astronaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.
  <br>
  <br>
  If all goes smoothly, the Dragon craft will deploy its parachutes off the coast of Florida for an ocean splashdown, where a recovery vessel will retrieve the crew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams' stay surpasses the standard six-month ISS rotation but ranks only sixth among US records for single-mission duration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Challenges such as muscle and bone loss, fluid shifts, and readjusting to gravity are well understood and well managed. (AFP)

    Indonesia to repatriate hundreds of scam workers

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 500 Indonesians freed from online scam centres in Myanmar are expected to be repatriated via Thailand in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cyberscam operations, which have thrived in Myanmar's lawless border areas for several years, lure foreign workers with promises of high-paying jobs but hold them hostage and force them to commit online fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 7,000 workers from at least two dozen countries have been freed in recent weeks, the majority of them Chinese, but many have been languishing in squalid temporary holding camps on the border between Myanmar and Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  400 Indonesian nationals will return home on Tuesday and around 160 are to come back on Wednesday, Judha Nugraha, the director of citizen protection at Indonesia's foreign ministry, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  They would come back on three flights from Bangkok after crossing into Thailand from Myanmar, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesian authorities already repatriated 140 nationals from Myanmar via Thailand last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in Myanmar, under pressure from ally China, have cracked down on the scam compounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Indonesians have been enticed abroad in recent years to other Southeast Asian countries for better-paying jobs, only to end up in the hands of transnational scam operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between 2020 and September last year, Jakarta repatriated more than 4,700 Indonesians entangled in online scam operations from countries including Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, according to foreign ministry data.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations estimates that as many as 120,000 people - many of them Chinese men - may be working in Myanmar scam centres against their will. (AFP)

    Kiribati eyes deep-sea mining deal with China

<img alt="View of Kiribati's Parliament House. Kiribati opened discussions with China after a deal with Canada's The Metals Company fell through. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796176_1_20250318084916.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pacific nation Kiribati says it is exploring a deep-sea mining partnership with China, dangling access to a vast patch of Pacific Ocean harbouring coveted metals and minerals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati opened discussions with Chinese ambassador Zhou Limin after a longstanding agreement with leading deep-sea mining outfit The Metals Company fell through.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talk provides an exciting opportunity to explore potential collaboration for the sustainable exploration of the deep-ocean resources in Kiribati," the government said on Monday evening in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pacific nations Kiribati, Cook Islands and Nauru sit at the forefront of a highly contentious push to mine the depths of the ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati holds rights for deep-sea mining exploration across a 75,000-square-kilometre swathe of the Pacific Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Through state-backed subsidiary Marawa Research, Kiribati had been working with Canada-based The Metals Company to develop the area's mineral deposits.
  <br>
  <br>
  That agreement was terminated "mutually" at the end of 2024, The Metals Company told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Metals Company said Kiribati's mining rights were "less commercially favourable than our other projects".
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm is racing to win regulatory approval that would make it one of the first companies to mine international waters on an industrial scale.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has partnerships with Kiribati's Pacific neighbours Nauru and Tonga.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the International Seabed Authority are currently meeting in Jamaica to thrash out the rules for deep-sea extraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Cook Islands struck a five-year agreement in February to cooperate in exploring the Pacific nation's seabed mineral riches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal did not include any exploration or mining licence. (AFP)

    Starbucks ordered to pay US$50m for hot tea spill

<img alt="A spokesperson for the coffee chain said the company would appeal the award. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796175_1_20250318083745.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Starbucks has been ordered to pay US$50 million to a customer who was burned when hot tea spilled on his lap at a California drive-through.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for Michael Garcia said the server who handed him three super-sized drinks in February 2020 did not push one of them into the cardboard cupholder properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  When he took the tray, the drink tipped over, "causing third degree burns to his penis, groin, and inner thighs," according to a statement from Trial Lawyers for Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a hospitalisation and multiple skin grafts, Michael has lived for five years with the disfigurement, pain, dysfunction, and psychological harm caused by the burns."
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which specialises in no-win-no-fee claims, said Starbucks had denied responsibility for Garcia's suffering, but before a jury trial had offered to settle for US$30 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the coffee giant balked at the demand for a public apology and a change in policy that Garcia wanted, so the case went to trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  A jury in Los Angeles on Friday awarded him US$50 million, a figure his attorneys said would eventually cost Starbucks more than US$60 million once pre-judgement interest, costs and attorneys' fees are added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starbucks Corporation consistently denied responsibility for five years, all the way up to and through trial, and attempted to escape responsibility," the lawyers' statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trial was a perfect example of frivolous defences and victim-blaming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proud of Michael for standing up for himself and having the courage to tell his story."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Starbucks said the company would appeal the award.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We sympathise with Mr Garcia, but we disagree with the jury's decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive," Jaci Anderson, director of corporate communications, said in a statement to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The case is redolent of a 1994 landmark legal action against McDonald's in New Mexico, when 79-year-old Stella Liebeck was awarded over US$2.8 million after spilling hot coffee on herself.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the award was reduced on appeal, the Liebeck case became a touchstone issue in US tort reform, and was often mocked as an example of how readily Americans resort to the law. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Monday warned his country must reduce its reliance on the United States and would turn towards its "reliable" European allies instead on his first trip abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carney's transatlantic visit to British leader Keir Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron came after US President Donald Trump suggested his country could become part of the United States and threatened its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After succeeding Justin Trudeau last week, Carney conspicuously chose key European powers France and the United Kingdom, rather than the United States, for his first trip abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following talks with UK Prime Minister Starmer in London, Carney told journalists his country "must diversify" its trade and security ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What is clear is that our trade and our security relations are too reliant on the United States. We must diversify," the former Bank of England governor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's one of the reasons for which my first visit is to Paris and London."
  <br>
  <br>
  Underlining their "shared values" and "shared king", Starmer thanked Carney for his "approach to Ukraine", two days after the Canadian leader took part in a video conference on shoring up support for Kyiv hosted by his UK counterpart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's King Charles -- who is also head of state in Canada -- earlier welcomed Carney for talks at Buckingham Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's UK correspondent Gavin Grey said the king would have to play delicate balancing act between supporting Carney but also being cordial to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He [Trump] has described King Charles in very, very glowing terms... so the British are very keen to use that, they are very keen to get a trade deal with America, at least some form of a trade deal, and get that expedited," Grey explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the king at the same time wanted to make it absolutely clear, in the coded world in which the king has to live -- he can't take sides, he can't offer political advice out loud -- but he wanted to make it clear that he was very supportive of Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney had travelled to the British capital after meeting France's President Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing Canada as the "most European of non-European countries", Carney said his nation needed to boost ties with European allies like France while trying to retain positive relations with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney faces threats on three fronts: a trade war with Washington, Trump's threats to annex his country and looming elections at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's imposition of an escalating raft of import tariffs on Canadian goods has threatened to trigger a recession, and his scorn for Canadian sovereignty sent jitters through the former ally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opinion polls show a large majority of Canadian voters reject Trump's argument that their country would be better off as the "51st state of the United States".
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trade war is a threat to the economy of the vast country of 41 million people, which has long enjoyed a close US partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, France and Britain are among the Nato members that have maintained strong support for Ukraine's beleaguered government and military since Russia's all-out attack in February 2022, even as Trump's US administration has pushed Kyiv to make concessions to Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  London and Paris are putting together plans for a coalition security force in Ukraine and looking for allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada and France want a "solid and lasting peace, accompanied by robust guarantees that will protect Ukraine against any further Russian aggression," Macron said alongside Carney.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is in this spirit that we will... continue to demand clear commitments from Russia," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney told Macron, who also took part in Saturday's call hosted by Starmer on Ukraine, that both nations stood for "sovereignty".
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain is Canada's third-largest trading partner and France its eleventh at a time when Trump's tariffs and Canadian retaliatory measures are threatening trade with its huge southern neighbour -- destination of three-quarters of Canada's exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Canada also has a "Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement" with the European Union, which includes France.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, which now likewise includes Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first speech as prime minister, Carney said: "Security is a priority for this government... as is diversifying our trading and commercial relationships, of course, with both Europe and the United Kingdom."
  <br>
  <br>
  On his return leg, Carney will touch down in Iqaluit in Nunavut, the Canadian territory closest to the Danish autonomous country of Greenland -- another Trump target for annexation -- to "reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty". (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of people protested in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen on Monday, the Iran-backed rebels' Al-Masirah TV showed, two days after US attacks that left dozens dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators waved placards and assault rifles, chanting "Death to America, death to Israel", at a huge protest in the capital Sanaa, while rallies were also held in Saada, Dhamar, Hodeida and Amran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demonstrations were called by the rebel group's leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the capital, seized by the Houthis in 2014, giant Yemeni and Palestinian flags punctuated a sea of demonstrators at Al-Sabeen Square, the site of weekly protests throughout the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yemen will never back down -- we defy the Americans, we defy the Zionists," said a man shouting slogans to the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifty-three people died and 98 were wounded in Saturday's US attacks on Sanaa and other areas, according to the Houthi health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump ordered the attacks following months of Houthi attacks on the vital Red Sea maritime trade route, despite a pause since Gaza's ceasefire started in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In retaliation, the rebels claimed to have twice attacked a US aircraft carrier group within 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Huthis, part of Iran's "axis of resistance" against the US and Israel, launched scores of drone and missile attacks on passing ships and Israeli territory during the Gaza war, claiming solidarity with the Palestinians. (AFP)

 Belgium and Rwanda have announced the expulsion of each other's diplomats, as relations deteriorated over allegations about their respective roles in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kigali said it was severing diplomatic relations and giving Belgian diplomats 48 hours to leave the East African country, accusing Brussels of "using lies and manipulation to secure an unjustified hostile opinion of Rwanda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgium's foreign affairs minister Maxime Prevot said the move was "disproportionate and shows that when we disagree with Rwanda they prefer not to engage in dialogue." Brussels will reciprocate by declaring Rwandan diplomats persona non grata, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  African leaders have been trying to establish a lasting ceasefire in Congo, where the Rwandan government is accused of supporting an offensive by M23 rebels in eastern Congo. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Brands including Prada have cut ties with South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun amid controversy over his relationship with actress Kim Sae-ron, who was found dead in February.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old actor who gained popularity in South Korea and China over his role in hit drama series "My Love from the Star" and "Queen of Tears" has been accused of dating Kim Sae-ron when she was underage in a YouTube expose, citing testimonies from the actress' relatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luxury fashion group Prada said it mutually decided to end its collaboration with Kim when asked in a client service chat on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dinto, a South Korean cosmetic brand, also announced it was ending its advertising contract with Kim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have determined that there are substantial grounds rendering the fulfilment of the advertising contract unfeasible," the company said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Soo-hyun's agency Goldmedalist referred to a statement given on Friday, when it denied claims that the two were in a relationship dating back to 2015 when Kim Sae-ron was a minor. She was also managed by the agency, but her contract was not renewed in 2022; the same year that she was involved in a drunk driving incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldmedalist also said Kim Soo-hyun, who has not commented directly, had been unfairly linked to Kim Sae-ron's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim, who was 24 years old, was found dead at her home. Her career had suffered since the drunk driving incident, and local media reported that she was in debt and working part-time jobs to pay it off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldmedalist said the actress owed the company around 0.7 billion won, or HK$3.75 million, in damages and penalties as a result of the drunk driving case.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, Kim Sae-ron posted a photo of her with Kim Soo-hyun which was quickly deleted, prompting speculation that the two were a couple.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer representing the relatives of Kim Sae-ron said on Monday that the late actress had decided to post the photo in hopes of hearing back from Kim Soo-hyun. (Reuters)

    Mt Fuji entry fee set for hikers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hikers attempting any of Mount Fuji's four main trails will be charged an entry fee of 4,000 yen from this summer, after local authorities passed a bill on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A record influx of foreign tourists to Japan has sparked alarm about overcrowding on the nation's highest mountain, a once-peaceful pilgrimage site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, Yamanashi region, home to Mount Fuji, introduced a 2,000 yen entry fee plus an optional donation for the active volcano's most popular hiking route, the Yoshida Trail.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cap on daily entries and online reservations were also brought in on that trail by officials concerned about safety and environmental damage on Fuji's majestic slopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yoshida Trail fee will be doubled for this year's July-September climbing season, while neighbouring Shizuoka region passed a bill on Monday to also charge 4,000 yen for its three trails, which were previously free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks in part to the new restrictions, the number of climbers who tackled Mount Fuji declined to 204,316 last year, from 221,322 in 2023, environment ministry data shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although climber numbers continue to be eclipsed by pre-pandemic levels, "200,000 hikers is still huge," said Natsuko Sodeyama, a Shizuoka prefecture official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no other mountain in Japan that attracts that many people in the span of just over two months. So some restrictions are necessary to ensure their safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mount Fuji is covered in snow for most of the year, but during the summer hiking season many trudge up its steep, rocky slopes through the night to see the sunrise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symmetrical mountain has been immortalised in countless artworks, including Hokusai's "Great Wave". It last erupted around 300 years ago. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump says he plans to speak to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday about ending the war in Ukraine, adding discussions are already ongoing about "dividing up certain assets" between the warring parties.
 <br>
  <br>
  US officials had expressed optimism on Sunday that a Ukraine-Russia ceasefire deal could be reached in weeks after Washington proposed a halt in fighting in the three-year war after talks in Saudi Arabia, which Kyiv accepted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we'll be talking about land... we'll be talking about power plants," Trump said aboard Air Force One.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington and Kyiv's European allies are pressing Moscow to accept a halt in the fighting, but Putin has given no clear answer – instead listing a string of conditions and raising "serious questions" over the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's envoy for the conflict, Steve Witkoff, who met for several hours with Putin days ago, told CNN that he thinks "the two presidents are going to have a really good and positive discussion this week".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, he added, "really expects there to be some sort of deal in the coming weeks, maybe, and I believe that's the case".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday accused the Kremlin of not wanting to end the war. He warned that Moscow wanted to first "improve their situation on the battlefield" before agreeing to any ceasefire. (AFP)

    Philippines Senate to probe Duterte handover

<img alt="Imee Marcos is the one who set the wheels in motion for the senate probe.  Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796060_1_20250317151836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philippine Senate said on Monday it will conduct a formal probe of ex-president Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and swift handover last week to the International Criminal Court, which is to try him for alleged crimes against humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old, the first Asian former head of state charged by the ICC, stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups have said killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe was initiated by Senator Imee Marcos, sister of President Ferdinand Marcos but a close friend of Duterte's eldest daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two families have had a spectacular falling out since Marcos teamed with Duterte to win an election landslide in 2022. The latter has since been impeached on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As chairperson of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am calling for an urgent investigation into the arrest of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, an issue that has deeply divided the nation," Imee Marcos said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is imperative to establish whether due process was followed and to ensure that his legal rights were not just upheld but protected," she said, adding: "Our sovereignty and legal processes must remain paramount."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was arrested at Manila airport on March 11 after a brief trip to Hong Kong and flown to the Netherlands just hours later where he was turned over to the ICC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate has set a public hearing for Thursday and invited top police and other government officials to give evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imee Marcos has tracked a course largely independent from her brother on many issues, though she is running for re-election under the administration ticket for the May 12 midterm elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours after the arrest, she challenged the wisdom of the arrest of "poor president Duterte", warning that "this can only lead to trouble".
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, she declared: "I cannot accept what they did to [Duterte]." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration began mass layoffs at Voice of America and other US-funded media, making clear its intent to gut outlets long seen as critical for US influence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Just a day after all employees were put on leave, staff working on a contractual basis received an email notifying them that they were terminated at the end of this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractors were told that "you must cease all work immediately and are not permitted to access any agency buildings or systems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractors make up much of VOA's workforce and dominate staffing in the non-English language services, although recent figures were not immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many contractors are not US citizens, meaning they likely depend on their soon-to-disappear jobs for visas to stay in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Full-time VOA staff, who have more legal protections, were not immediately terminated but remain on administrative leave and have been told not to work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voice of America, created during World War II, broadcast around the world in 49 languages with a mission to reach countries deemed to be without media freedom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed an executive order on Friday targeting VOA's parent US Agency for Global Media in his latest sweeping cuts to the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency had 3,384 employees in the 2023 fiscal year. It had requested US$950 million for the current fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With VOA in limbo, some of its services have switched to playing music for lack of new programming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sweeping cuts also froze Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, formed in the Cold War to reach the former Soviet bloc, and Radio Free Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other US-funded outlets being gutted include Radio Farda, a Persian-language broadcaster blocked by Iran's government, and Alhurra, an Arabic-language network established after the Iraq invasion in the face of highly critical coverage by Qatar-based Al-Jazeera.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said on Saturday that "taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump regularly criticizes media coverage of him and has questioned the wisdom of funding VOA when it has a "firewall" ensuring its editorial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an editorial on the demise of VOA, China's Global Times tabloid said that "the monopoly of information held by some traditional Western media is being shattered."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multidimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughingstock of the times," it said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Unusually vicious and damaging weather across multiple US states spawned violent tornadoes, blinding dust storms and fast-moving wildfires this weekend, leaving at least 37 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hailey Hart and her fiancé Steve Romero hunkered down with their three huskies inside their 1994 Toyota Celica as a tornado ripped apart their home Saturday in Tylertown, Mississippi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romero said he prayed out loud and hugged Hart as the car rolled onto its side, windows shattering, before it landed on its wheels again. After the twister passed, they could hear people nearby screaming for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was a bad dream come true,” Romero said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next door, Hart’s grandparents crawled out from the rubble of their destroyed house after they sought shelter in a bathroom as falling trees collapsed the roof.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Everything was coming down on us,” said Donna Blansett, Hart’s grandmother. “All I could do was pray to God to save us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  They escaped with just a few scratches and aches. Family members, friends and volunteers spent Sunday removing debris and salvaging anything they could find - some damp clothes, a photo album and a few toiletries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so happy you’re alive,” Hart said through tears, as she embraced her grandmother on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service said tornado watches had mostly expired, but dangerous winds were still possible in the Carolinas, east Georgia and northern Florida through Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dynamic storm that began Friday earned an unusual “high risk” designation from weather forecasters. Still, experts said it was not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least three people, including an 82-year-old woman, were killed in central Alabama when multiple tornadoes swept across the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Troy, Alabama, parks officials said the recreation centre where many residents had taken refuge had to be closed due to damage from overnight storms. No one was injured.
  <br>

   <br>
   Missouri resident Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing trapped neighbours found five bodies scattered in rubble on Friday night outside what remained of his aunt’s house in hard-hit Wayne County. Scattered twisters killed at least a dozen people in the state, authorities said.

    In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reeves announced that six people died and more than 200 were displaced after tornadoes sowed devastation across three counties. And in the northern part of the state, roads were inundated and some people were stranded by flood waters.
    <br>
    <br>
    Wind-driven wildfires caused extensive damage in Texas and Oklahoma and officials warned on Sunday that parts of both states would again face an increased risk of fire danger in the coming week.
    <br>
    <br>
    More than 130 fires were reported across Oklahoma and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed, Governor Kevin Stitt said.
    <br>
    <br>
    Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management spokesperson Keli Cain said two people were killed as a result of wildfires and weather.
    <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, dust storms spurred by high winds claimed almost a dozen lives on Friday.
    <br>
    <br>
    Eight people died in a Kansas highway pileup involving at least 50 vehicles, according to the state highway patrol. Authorities said three people also were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle. (AP)

    Stranded astronauts to return to Earth on Tuesday

<img alt="A Nasa livestream shows the SpaceX Dragon crew spacecraft approaching the International Space Station on Saturday, before docking a day later. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795995_1_20250317091414.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pair of US astronauts stuck for more than nine months on the International Space Station will be returned to Earth on Tuesday evening, Nasa said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are to be transported home with another American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, which arrived at the ISS early on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stranded duo have been on the ISS since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa said in a statement on Sunday evening that it had moved forward the astronauts' anticipated ocean splashdown off the Florida coast to Tuesday evening. It was initially slated for no sooner than Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favourable weather conditions expected for later in the week," the space agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos astronaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will also return on the Dragon capsule, with the journey to be broadcast live from Monday evening when hatch closure preparations begin.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Wilmore and Williams, it will mark the end of an ordeal that has seen them stuck for nine months after what was meant to have been a days-long roundtrip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their prolonged stay was significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russia's Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station. (AFP)

    UK finance minister to unveil plan to cut red tape

<img alt="Regulators will be summoned to Downing Street to hear Rachel Reeves' action plan to cut the administrative cost of regulation on business. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795990_1_20250317085014.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's Labour government will on Monday set out details of how it plans to slash red tape to boost business, as it struggles to deliver growth nine months after winning power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chancellor Rachel Reeves' shake-up comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer took aim at the nation's "flabby state", sparking anger from unions who called on him to avoid the "incendiary rhetoric" of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance ministry said regulators would be summoned to the prime minister's Downing Street office on Monday to hear Reeves announce her "action plan to deliver on the pledge to cut the administrative cost of regulation on business by a quarter".
  <br>
  <br>
  The "radical" plan would cut "costly red tape" such as the "hundreds of pages of guidance on protecting bat habitats which goes far beyond legal requirements", said a statement, referring to the £100 million (US$130 million) spent on a bat tunnel by the company building Britain's new high-speed HS2 train line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel has become a lightning rod for criticism of the planning system, with the Prime Minister describing it as "absurd".
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of regulators will also be cut under Reeves' plan, saving businesses "billions of pounds", the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer on Thursday announced that he was axing NHS England which has run the state-run National Health Service in that nation since 2012, in a move seen as a dramatic shift to the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has dubbed NHS England "the world's largest quango" (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation).
  <br>
  <br>
  Its abolition was the "beginning not the end" and more health-related quangos would also face the chop, Health Secretary Wes Streeting wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour ousted former prime minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative government in a landslide election victory last July but has seen its popularity ratings fall during a bumpy start.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is under pressure to deliver on its election promise to kickstart economic growth while keeping prices under control amid a prolonged cost of living crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The central bank in February slashed its forecast for UK economic growth and warned that inflation would rise more than expected this year, blaming global risks amid US tariff threats and deteriorating business confidence in the UK. (AFP)

    Hospitalised Pope Francis addresses frailty

<img alt="Children holding balloons gather by the statue of John Paul II outside the Gemelli University Hospital where Pope Francis is hospitalised, in Rome.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis acknowledged being fragile and "facing a period of trial", as he thanked well-wishers on Sunday for prayers in a message from hospital, where he has been slowly recovering from pneumonia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pope, who has weathered his setbacks along with periods of improvement since being hospitalised on February 14, sent a particularly personal message to the faithful that referenced both his faith and his frailty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am sharing these thoughts with you while I am facing a period of trial, and I join with so many brothers and sisters who are sick: fragile, at this time, like me," wrote the pope in the message published by the Vatican.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our bodies are weak but, even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope," he added in the message marking the second Sunday of Lent, a 40-day period of prayer and reflection leading up to Easter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday was the fifth time in a row the pope's illness had prevented him from personally giving the Angelus prayer, usually delivered to a crowd gathered in St Peter's Square following mass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Francis has yet to appear at the window of his papal suite on the 10th floor of the Gemelli hospital, that has not dissuaded a steady stream of well-wishers from gathering.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, dozens of children including scouts from a Catholic group stood at the foot of a statue of Pope John Paul II at the hospital's entrance, holding yellow and white balloons and vainly striving to catch a glimpse of the pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You see the pope there!" shouted one of them eagerly, before being set straight by the group leader, Valerio Santobonio, 23: "I don't think that's him."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday we had some drawings made specifically to give to the Holy Father," Santobonio told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the boys and girls, aged from five to seven, don't quite yet grasp who the pope is, nor his health situation, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite not appearing at the window to wave, Francis addressed his youngest well-wishers in his message.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to 'Gemelli' as a sign of closeness," Francis wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you, dearest children! The pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week the Vatican signalled that the Argentine Jesuit was out of danger after a series of breathing crises earlier in his hospitalisation had sparked fears for his life.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the Vatican said Francis's condition continued to be stable and showing progress, as it has for the past week, but cautioned he still needed therapies administered within the hospital setting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Holy Father still requires hospital medical therapy, motor and respiratory physiotherapy; these therapies, at present, are showing further, gradual improvements," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That message appeared to quash speculation that the pope's progress could signal an imminent release from hospital. (AFP)

    'Most scared I've been': US strikes sow panic in Yemen

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first US strikes against Yemen's Houthis since Donald Trump took office killed 31 people, the rebels said on Sunday, with the US president warning "hell will rain down upon" the Iran-backed group if it did not stop attacking shipping.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis, who have attacked Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, said children were among those killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attacks on Sanaa, as well as on areas in Saada, Al-Bayda and Radaa, killed at least 31 people and wounded 101, "most of whom were children and women", Houthi health ministry spokesperson Anis Al-Asbahi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage on Houthi media showed children and a woman among those being treated in a hospital emergency room, including a dazed girl with blackened legs wrapped in bandages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in a post on social media, vowed to "use overwhelming lethal force" to end the Houthi attacks, which the rebels say are in solidarity with Palestinians amid the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  After halting their attacks when a ceasefire took effect in Gaza in January, the Houthis announced on Tuesday that they would resume them until Israel lifted its blockade of aid to the devastated Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late on Saturday, a plume of white smoke had risen over Sanaa after explosions rocked the northern district of the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Houthis sealed off areas around the blast sites, making it impossible to gauge the true scale of the destruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohammad Albasha, a US-based consultant, said the area targeted in Sanaa was home to senior Houthi leaders and considered their stronghold in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the point of no return, and from now on, it's gloves off between the Houthis and CENTCOM," he said, referring to the regional US military command.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amal, 29, who lives with her mother in Sanaa, said Saturday's attacks were "terrifying... windows were shattered and the walls of the house shook".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Several military operations against the Houthis have been announced, but they've only added more casualties, most of them civilians."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The homes and locations of the leaders are well-known, but the victims are always civilians." (AFP)

 A fire that tore through a nightclub in North Macedonia killed 59 revellers attending a hip-hop concert at the venue, with more than 100 wounded, the country's interior minister said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out in "Pulse", a nightclub in the eastern town of Kocani, where more than 1,000 mostly young fans had crammed in to see the hip-hop duo DNK popular in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to the data we have by now, 59 persons lost their lives," interior minister Pance Toskovski said after visiting the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 100 persons are injured," Toskovski said, adding that the wounded had been transported to the local hospital in the town as well as to the capital Skopje and the town of Stip some 30 kilometres to the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  The concert kicked off around midnight, while online media outlet SDK, reported that the fire started about three hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Toskovski, the fire was probably caused by the use of pyrotechnic devices "used for light effect at the concert".
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment of activating the so-called sprinklers, the sparks caught the ceiling that was made of easily flammable material after which for a very short period of time the fire spread across the whole discotheque, creating a thick smoke" Toskovski said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Helicopters ferried some of the wounded to the capital Skope's hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted on social networks and shot before the fire show the use of stage jets, a type of indoor fireworks used during concerts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other videos published by media in the Balkan country show the entrance to the building blackened by flames.

 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke on Saturday to discuss the next stage in talks on ending Moscow's war against Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, the top diplomats "agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement gave no details on when the next round of US-Russia talks, which are being hosted by Saudi Arabia, would begin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also updated Lavrov on military activity in the Middle East, where US forces carried out deadly strikes on Saturday against Huthi rebel targets in Yemen, the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite recent tensions between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, Kyiv has agreed in principle to a US-brokered 30-day unconditional ceasefire if Moscow halts its attacks in eastern Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's President Vladimir Putin has not however agreed to any truce, instead setting conditions that were beyond what was called for in the US agreement with Ukraine. (AFP)

    US launches large-scale strikes against Yemeni Houthis

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 19 were killed as US President Donald Trump launched large-scale military strikes against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis on Saturday over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping, warning "hell will rain down" on them if they do not stop.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump also warned Iran, the Houthis' main backer, that it needed to immediately halt support for the group. He said if Iran threatened the United States, "America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The unfolding strikes - which one official said would last days and maybe weeks - represent the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since Trump took office in January. It came as the United States ramps up sanctions pressure on Tehran while trying to bring it to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 13 civilians were killed and nine injured in US strikes on Yemen's capital Sanaa, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six others, including four children and one woman, were killed and 11 were injured in a US strike on the northern province of Saada, the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis' political bureau described the attacks as a "war crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to respond to escalation with escalation," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents in Sanaa said the strikes hit a building in a Houthi stronghold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The explosions were violent and shook the neighbourhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children," one of the residents, who gave his name as Abdullah Yahia, told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis, an armed movement that took control of most of Yemen over the past decade, have launched more than 100 attacks targeting shipping since November 2023, disrupting global commerce and setting the US military on a costly campaign to intercept missiles and drones that burned through stocks of US air defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis say the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's other allies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, have been severely weakened by Israel since the start of the Gaza conflict. Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who was closely aligned with Tehran, was overthrown by rebels in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  But throughout, Yemen's Houthis have remained resilient and often on the offensive, sinking two vessels, seizing another and killing at least four seafarers in an offensive that disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US administration of former President Joe Biden had sought to degrade the Houthis' ability to attack vessels off its coast but limited the U.S. actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Trump has authorised a more aggressive approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes on Saturday were carried out in part by fighter aircraft from the Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, which is in the Red Sea, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US military's Central Command, which oversees troops in the Middle East, described Saturday's strikes as the start of a large-scale operation across Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Houthi attacks on American ships & aircraft (and our troops!) will not be tolerated; and Iran, their benefactor, is on notice," Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. "Freedom of Navigation will be restored."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump held out the prospect of far more devastating military action against Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective," Trump wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump’s proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,” he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. “A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,” Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 , a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.

    Gaza civil defence says Israeli strikes kill 9

<img alt="Hamas says the Israeli strikes on Beit Lahia violate the Gaza truce deal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795885_1_20250315222731.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said nine people, including journalists, were killed in Israeli strikes in the north on Saturday, an attack Hamas denounced as a "blatant violation" of the fragile ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Nine martyrs have been transferred (to hospital), including several journalists and a number of workers from the Al-Khair Charitable Organisation, as a result of the occupation targeting a vehicle with a drone in the town of Beit Lahia, coinciding with artillery shelling on the same area," said civil defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory reported that "nine martyrs and several injured, including critical cases, have arrived at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza Strip, due to the ongoing Israeli aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Israeli military said it struck "two terrorists... operating a drone that posed a threat to IDF troops in the area of Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Later, a number of additional terrorists collected the drone operating equipment and entered a vehicle. The IDF struck the terrorists," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the strikes, Hamas accused Israel of violating the Gaza truce deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The occupation (Israel) has committed a horrific massacre in the northern Gaza Strip by targeting a group of journalists and humanitarian workers, in a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of Hamas-affiliated media in Gaza, Ismail Thawabteh, said that local photo journalists were killed while "using a drone to capture images of a Ramadan dining table in Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they were "directly targeted by the occupation in two air strikes, despite their work being clear."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has carried out near-daily air strikes in Gaza since early March, often targeting what the military said were militants planting explosive devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce in Israel's war with Hamas, in effect since January 19, has largely held despite the attacks and with no agreement yet on extending the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the truce ended on March 1, but both Israel and Hamas have refrained from returning to all-out war. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he had urged Kyiv's Western allies to give "a clear position" on security guarantees, including about a potential foreign troop contingent on Ukrainian soil with a US backstop.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer held a virtual call with other European leaders and allies, including Zelensky, where Starmer said a "coalition of the willing" would help secure Ukraine "on the land, at sea and in the sky" in the event of a peace deal with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to continue working on the contingents that will form the foundation of Europe's future Armed Forces," Zelensky said in a post on X with an image of himself taking part in the call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Peace will be more reliable with European contingents on the ground and the American side as a backstop."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has also called for a US security backstop to help secure a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine in the three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian leader Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he supported in principle US President Donald Trump's proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine, but that Russia would fight on until several crucial conditions were worked out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky urged European leaders to dismiss Putin's opposition to European peacekeepers in Ukraine and blamed the Russian leader for stalling peace efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A ceasefire could have already happened, but Russia is doing everything to prevent it," he said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Russian captain of a cargo ship which struck a tanker in the North Sea off the UK's northeastern coast appeared in court on Saturday charged with gross negligence manslaughter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vladimir Motin, 59, appeared before magistrates in the port of Hull, where he was remanded in custody. He did not enter a plea, and will next appear in the Old Bailey in London on April 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, was arrested on Monday after his ship, the Portuguese-flagged Solong, rammed into the fuel-laden tanker Stena Immaculate, setting both vessels ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Humberside Police said earlier that "extensive searches" by HM Coastguard to locate a missing crew member from the Solong had failed to locate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crew member was identified by state prosecutors as Mark Angelo Pernia, a 38-year-old Filipino, who is now presumed dead, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-flagged tanker, which had been chartered by the US military, was anchored off the coast of Hull in northeastern England at the time of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were granted two extensions on Wednesday and Thursday to allow more time to question the captain, given "the complexities of the incident," the Humberside police force said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  An investigation led by the UK, with US and Portuguese teams, has been launched to determine the exact cause of the collision, and why the Solong did not deviate from its course before it ploughed into the tanker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK government has ruled out foul play so far. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 UK premier Keir Starmer said on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would "sooner or later" have to "come to the table" as he opened a virtual summit to drum up support for a coalition willing to protect any eventual ceasefire in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British prime minister told some 25 fellow leaders as they joined a virtual call hosted by Downing Street that they should focus on how to strengthen Ukraine, protect any ceasefire and keep up the pressure on Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Ukraine had shown it was the "party of peace" by agreeing to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, "Putin is the one trying to delay," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Putin is serious about peace, I think it's very simple, he has to stop his barbaric attacks on Ukraine and agree to a ceasefire, and the world is watching," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight fighting continued in the relentless three-year war, with Russia saying it had taken two more villages in its Kursk border region where it has launched an offensive to wrest back seized territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  As moves have gathered pace for a ceasefire, Moscow has pushed this week to retake a large part of the land that Ukraine originally captured in western Kursk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian defence ministry said troops took control over the villages of Zaoleshenka and Rubanshchina – north and west of the town of Sudzha, the main town that Moscow reclaimed this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv, meanwhile, said its air force had overnight downed 130 Iranian-made Russian-launched Shahed drones over 14 regions of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin has called on embattled Ukrainian troops in Kursk to "surrender," while his US counterpart Donald Trump urged the Kremlin to spare their lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't allow President Putin to play games with President Trump's deal," Starmer said in comments released by Downing Street late on Friday, ahead of Saturday's call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Kremlin's complete disregard for President Trump's ceasefire proposal only serves to demonstrate that Putin is not serious about peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have been leading efforts to assemble a so-called "coalition of the willing" ever since Trump opened direct negotiations with Moscow last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  They say the group is necessary – along with US support – to provide Ukraine with security guarantees by deterring Putin from violating any ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was on Saturday's call, said on Friday he had discussed "technical aspects" of how the ceasefire could be implemented with Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our teams continue to work on clear security guarantees, and they will be ready soon," Zelensky said on the social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and Macron have said they are willing to put British and French troops on the ground in Ukraine, but it is not clear if other countries are keen on doing the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called on Russia late on Friday to accept the proposal for a ceasefire and stop making statements aimed at "delaying the process."
  <br>
  <br>
  The French president also demanded that Moscow stop its "acts of violence" in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany on Friday likewise criticised Putin's response to the US-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine as "at best a delaying tactic."
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday he was "cautiously optimistic" about reaching a truce, but acknowledged there was "a lot of work that remains to be done."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has said he welcomes any offer of support for the coalition, raising the prospect that some countries could contribute logistics or surveillance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The call is expected to delve further into how countries plan to contribute to the coalition of the willing, ahead of a military planning session being held next week," the UK government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Starmer will say that countries "need to ratchet up economic pressure on Russia, to force Putin into negotiations, in the short term."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And be prepared to support a just and enduring peace in Ukraine over the long term and continue to ramp up our military support to Ukraine to defend themselves against increasing Russian attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  British Commonwealth partners Canada, Australia and New Zealand have been involved in early talks and are due to dial in to the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nato chief Mark Rutte and European Union chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa are also expected to take part, along with the leaders of Germany, Spain, Portugal, Latvia, Romania, Turkey and the Czech Republic, among others. (AFP)

    Cuba suffers fourth nationwide blackout in five months

<img alt="People gather in a neighbourhood during a national electrical grid collapse in Havana, Cuba. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795833_1_20250315115602.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cuba suffered a general blackout on Friday caused by a crash of its national electricity grid, officials said, the fourth major power outage on the cash-strapped communist island in five months.
 <br>
  <br>
  "At around 8:15 pm tonight, a breakdown... caused the significant loss of power in western Cuba and with it the fall of the national electricity system," the Ministry of Energy and Mines said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on the social network X, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz said the government was "working tirelessly" to restore power.
  <br>
  <br>
  In by now familiar scenes, the streets of Havana were plunged into darkness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a few hotels and private businesses with generators still had lights on, as did essential services such as hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Angelica Caridad Martinez, a resident of the central city of Camaguey, said she was about to sit down for dinner when the power failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not even hungry anymore," the 50-year-old said, "This situation is unsustainable, no one can live like this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The island of 9.7 million inhabitants has suffered three nationwide blackouts in the final months of 2024, two of them lasting several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The repeated outages comes as the island battles its worst economic crisis in 30 years, marked by widespread shortages of food, medicine and fuel, high inflation and a massive outflow of migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday night marked the first general blackout of 2025, but citizens face almost daily outages of four or five hours across much of Havana, while in rural provinces the periods without power can last 20 hours or longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cuba's eight thermal power plants, nearly all of which came online in the 1980s or 1990s, suffer routine failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Turkish floating power barges that help boost Cuba's national grid are fed with expensive imported fuel which is often in short supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cuba's leadership points to a six-decade-long US trade embargo that intensified during Donald Trump's first presidency for its difficulties in keeping the lights on.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make up its electricity shortfall, Cuba is racing to install a series of at least 55 solar farms with Chinese technology by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to authorities, these facilities will generate some 1,200 megawatts of power, about 12 percent of the national total. (AFP)

    Crew launch to ISS to replace stuck astronauts

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than nine months on the International Space Station, two astronauts are a step closer to returning home following the launch of a crew swap mission on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Falcon 9 rocket with a Crew Dragon fixed to its top blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carrying a four-member team bound for the orbital outpost.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We celebrate the countless individuals all over the world that have made this journey possible," said astronaut Nichole Ayers, the designated pilot of the Crew-10 mission, just before launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the real focus is what their arrival enables - the long-overdue departure from the ISS of NASA duo Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two former US Navy pilots have been stuck aboard the orbital lab since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Starliner returned empty, without experiencing further major issues and what was meant to have been a days-long round-trip for Wilmore and Williams has now stretched past nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by NASA astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station.
  <br>
  <br>
  What began as a technical failure has also spiraled into a political flashpoint, as President Donald Trump and his close advisor, Elon Musk, who leads SpaceX, have repeatedly suggested that former president Joe Biden "abandoned" the pair intentionally and rejected a plan to bring them back sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, has drawn attention for his bizarre remarks about the situation, referring to Williams, a decorated former naval captain, as "the woman with the wild hair" and speculating about the personal dynamic between the two.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've been left up there. I hope they like each other, maybe they love each other, I don't know," he said during a recent White House press conference. (AFP)

    Putin tells Ukraine troops in Kursk to 'surrender'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on beleaguered Ukrainian troops in the Russian region of Kursk to "surrender" as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Russian leader of seeking to sabotage a ceasefire initiative.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump urged Putin to spare the lives of the Ukrainian troops as he said his envoy had held "productive" talks with Russia's leader on a proposed 30-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has mounted a rapid counteroffensive in the western border region of Kursk over the past week, recapturing much of the territory Ukraine seized in a shock incursion last August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat in Kursk would be a major blow to Ukraine's plans to use its hold on the region as a bargaining chip in peace talks for the three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are sympathetic to President Trump's call," Putin said in remarks broadcast on Russian television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment," Putin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said "thousands" of Ukrainian troops were "completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's military leadership denied the claims. "There is no threat of our units being encircled," Ukraine's General Staff posted on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky gave a more sober assessment in comments to reporters in Kyiv. "The situation in the Kursk region is obviously very difficult," he said, while insisting the campaign still had value.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's latest comments came as he gave an update on a meeting on Thursday between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin on a US-Ukrainian proposal for a 30-day pause in hostilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said on Thursday that he had "serious questions" about the proposal and that events in Kursk would influence the next moves towards a ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said on Friday that it was "cautiously optimistic" a deal could be reached, but that Trump and Putin had to speak directly before talks could progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin, addressing his Security Council, said he had read Trump's appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  While accusing Ukrainian troops of carrying out crimes against civilians that he said amounted to "terrorism", something Kyiv denies, Putin said he understood the call by Trump to take humanitarian considerations into account. (Agencies)

    Mark Carney sworn in as Canada's PM

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Carney was formally sworn in as prime minister of Canada on Friday, putting him in a position to fight tariffs from US President Donald Trump that could devastate the trade-dependent Canadian economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the presence of Governor General Mary Simon, the personal representative of King Charles, who is Canada's head of state, Carney took the oath of office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moment capped a momentous rise for the 59-year-old, who became the first Canadian prime minister without any serious political experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney plans to travel to London and Paris next week, said a diplomat aware of the plans. Canada has sought to shore up alliances in Europe as its relations with the United States sink to unprecedented lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney has reshaped his cabinet with a view to dealing with Washington. Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc is moving to the international trade portfolio and will be replaced by current Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney crushed his rivals on Sunday in a race to become leader of the ruling Liberal Party. He replaces Justin Trudeau, who spent more than nine years in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former head of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, successfully argued his position as an outsider with a history of tackling crises meant he was the best person to take on Trump, who has repeatedly talked about annexing Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Carney told reporters that he was ready to meet Trump when "there is respect for Canadian sovereignty."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he would keep in place retaliatory tariffs on US goods until the United States showed Canada some respect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts are underway to arrange a call between Trump and Carney in the next couple of days, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters on Friday. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte failed to show in person at the International Criminal Court on Friday at the opening of his crimes against humanity hearing over his deadly crackdown on narcotics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old, the first ex-Asian head of state to face charges at the ICC, was following by video link during a short hearing to inform him of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sounding frail and wearing a blue suit and tie, he spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth. The presiding judge allowed him to follow proceedings in absentia due to his long flight to The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the prosecutor's application for his arrest, he said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in the Philippines."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims' families have welcomed the trial as a chance to get justice, while Duterte supporters believe he was "kidnapped" and sent to The Hague amid a spectacular fallout with the ruling Marcos family. (AFP)

<img alt="The MV Stena Immaculate tanker was hit by the MV Solong container vessel on March 10. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795780_1_20250314214139.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police on Friday again extended the detention of the captain of a cargo ship that struck a tanker in the North Sea, citing the "complexities" of the case.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Russian captain was arrested on Monday on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter after his ship, the Solong, slammed into the tanker anchored off the coast of Hull in northeastern England, setting both ships ablaze and leaving one sailor presumed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were granted two extensions on Wednesday and Thursday to allow more time to question the 59-year-old captain due to "the complexities of the incident," the local Humberside police force said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police cited the location of both vessels at sea as one of the complications facing the probe, with the ships on fire for several days after the incident, requiring a massive firefighting response.
  <br>
  <br>
  While all crew onboard the jet fuel-laden tanker, the US-flagged Stena Immaculate, were safely rescued, one sailor from the Portuguese-flagged Solong remains missing and presumed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the government has ruled out foul play, investigators are still determining the causes of the crash, in which the Solong never deviated from its course and slammed into the Stena at 16 knots an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pockets of fire were still being reported on the deck of the Solong on Thursday evening, according to the UK Coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Extensive lines of enquiry are continuing," police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salvage teams boarded the vessels on Thursday to carry out initial damage assessments. (AFP)

    Lunar eclipse brings 'bloody' marvellous spectacle

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stargazers across a swathe of the world marvelled at a dramatic red "Blood Moon" during a rare total lunar eclipse in the early hours of Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The celestial spectacle was visible in the Americas and Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as well as in the westernmost parts of Europe and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The phenomenon happens when the sun, earth and moon line up, causing our planet to cast a giant shadow across its satellite.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the earth's shadow crept across the moon, it did not entirely blot out its white glow. Instead the moon glowed a reddish colour.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because the only sunlight that reaches the moon is "bent and scattered" as it goes through earth's atmosphere, said Daniel Brown, an astronomer at Britain's Nottingham Trent University.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is similar to how the light can become pink or red during sunrises or sunsets on earth, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The more clouds and dust there are in earth's atmosphere, the redder the moon appears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown called the lunar eclipse, which will last around six hours, "an amazing way to see the solar system in action."
  <br>
  <br>
  The period when the moon is completely in earth's shadow, called the totality, lasts just over an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  This event has been dubbed the "Blood Worm Moon," after one of the names given to March full moons by some Native Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first total lunar eclipse since 2022, but there will be another one in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's event is a "Micromoon," meaning the moon is the farthest away it gets from earth, making it appear about seven percent smaller than normal, according to the website Earthsky.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the opposite of a "Supermoon," as was seen during 2022's lunar eclipse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some stargazers will be in for another treat later this month. That will be a partial solar eclipse. (AFP)

    US Senate in race to avert government shutdown

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate finds itself on Friday in a familiar position, working to avoid a partial government shutdown with just hours to spare as Democrats confront two painful options: allowing passage of a bill they believe gives President Donald Trump vast discretion on spending decisions or voting no and letting a funding lapse ensue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer gave members of his caucus days to vent their frustration about the options before them, but late on Thursday made clear he will not allow a shutdown. His move gives Democrats room to side with Republicans and allow the continuing resolution, often described as a CR, to come up for a vote as soon as Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A procedural vote on Friday will provide a first test of whether the package has the 60 votes needed to advance, ahead of final voting likely later in the day. At least eight Democrats will need to join with Republicans to move the funding package forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  “While the CR still is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,” Schumer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congress has been unable to pass the annual appropriations bills designed to fund the government, so they've resorted to passing short-term extensions instead. The legislation before the Senate marks the third such continuing resolution for the current fiscal year, now nearly half over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legislation would fund the federal government through the end of September. It would trim non-defense spending by about US$13 billion from the previous year and increase defense spending by about US$6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly US$1.7 trillion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican-led House passed the spending bill on Tuesday and then adjourned. The move left senators with a decision to either take it or leave it. And while Democrats have been pushing for a vote on a fourth short-term extension, GOP leadership made clear that option was a non-starter. (AP)

    China hosts trilateral nuclear talks with Iran, Russia

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged an end to "illegal" sanctions on Iran as it hosted diplomats from that country and Russia on Friday for talks Beijing hopes will restart long-stalled negotiations on Tehran's nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi held their meeting in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A readout of the talks by CCTV said the three diplomats "exchanged views on the Iran nuclear issue and other issues of common concern".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma expressed China's support for "political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue based on mutual respect" after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We emphasised the necessity of ending all illegal, unilateral sanctions," Ma told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The relevant parties should work to eliminate the root causes of the current situation and abandon sanctions, pressure, and threats of the use of force."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement, the three countries reaffirmed that political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue remains the only viable and practical option for the Iranian nuclear issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which had imposed curbs on Tehran's nuclear development in return for sanctions relief, during US President Donald Trump's first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the agreement for a year after Washington's withdrawal but then began rolling back its commitments. Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump recently sent a letter to Tehran urging nuclear talks, warning of possible military action if it refuses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded that he would not negotiate with the US while being "threatened", and Iran would not bow to US "orders" to talk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran has long denied that it is working on developing a nuclear weapon. But the International Atomic Energy Agency warned last month that Tehran was "dramatically" accelerating enrichment of uranium to near the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level. (AFP/Reuters)

 An American Airlines plane caught fire after landing at Denver International Airport, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flight 1006, which was headed from Colorado Springs to Dallas, diverted to Denver and landed safely around 5.15pm on Thursday after the crew reported engine vibrations, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While taxiing to the gate, an engine on the Boeing 737-800 caught fire, the FAA added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers stood on one of the plane’s wings as smoke surrounded the aircraft. The FAA said passengers exited using the slides.
  <br>
  <br>
  American said the flight experienced an engine-related issue after taxiing to the gate. There was no immediate clarification on exactly when the plane caught fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 172 passengers and six crew members were taken to the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twelve people were transported to hospitals with minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We thank our crew members, DEN team and first responders for their quick and decisive action with the safety of everyone on board and on the ground as the priority,” American said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters put out the blaze by  evening, an airport spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said it will investigate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country has seen a recent spate of aviation disasters and close calls stoking fears about air travel, though flying remains a very safe mode of transport. (AP)

    Japanese duo pay for Great Wall buttocks 'prank'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Japanese tourists in their 20s were detained for two weeks in China then deported for taking photos showing exposed buttocks at the Great Wall, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident at the World Heritage site near Beijing concerned a man who showed his bottom and a woman who took photos, NTV and other Japanese media outlets reported on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's foreign ministry said on Friday that "the embassy of Japan in China confirmed on January 3 that two Japanese nationals were detained by local authorities at the Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  They "were subsequently released and returned to Japan during January", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese embassy did not reply to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists were detained on the spot by security guards and held for around two weeks, the reports said, citing sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exposing the lower half of the body in a public place is against the law in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists reportedly told the embassy they did it as a prank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reports sparked outrage in China, where memories of atrocities committed during Japan's occupation of the country in the 1930s and 40s still evoke strong feelings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hashtag translating to "Japanese man and woman detained for indecent behaviour at the Great Wall" had been viewed more than 60 million times on Weibo by Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many top-liked comments blasted the tourists for the act, with some using hateful language toward Japanese people.
  <br>
  <br>
  One comment by actor Chen Yitian, who has over seven million followers on the platform, condemned them for doing "shameful things on my Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others suggested China ban all Japanese visitors. (AFP)

    US influencer visa under review after wombat outcry

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia is reviewing an American influencer’s visa after she posted video of her snatching a baby wombat from its mother.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sam Jones, who describes herself as an “outdoor enthusiast & hunter,” made her Instagram account private on Thursday after she was widely condemned for the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  It shows her lifting the wombat joey by its front legs in darkness from a roadside and running away from its mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I caught a baby wombat,” she says, as a man filming her laughs. She returns the wombat to the roadside after several seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said her visa was under review.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The department is now working through the conditions on her current visa and determining whether immigration law has been breached,” Burke said in a statement on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I can’t wait for Australia to see the back of this individual, I don’t expect she will return,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added his voice to the criticism. “To take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage,” Albanese told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there. Take another animal that can actually fight back rather than stealing a baby wombat from its mother,” Albanese added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones, who also uses the name Samantha Strable, closed her social media channels to messages and couldn’t be reached for comment on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wombat appears to be a common wombat, also known as a bare-nosed wombat. It is a protected marsupial found only in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yolandi Vermaak, founder of the animal care charity Wombat Rescue, said separating the young wombat from its mother created a risk that the mother would reject her offspring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My biggest concern is that we didn’t actually see mom and baby getting reunited. When she put it down, it looked disoriented. It was turned away from where the mother was last seen. So we don’t know if mom and baby actually found each other again,” Vermaak told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. (AP)

    Johns Hopkins University to cut thousands of jobs

<img alt="President Trump signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to allow time to assess overseas expenses. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795666_1_20250314084123.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The prestigious Johns Hopkins University said on Thursday it was being forced to lay off more than 2,000 employees in the aftermath of the Trump administration's massive reduction in foreign aid funding.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is a difficult day for our entire community. The termination of more than US$800 million in USAID funding is now forcing us to wind down critical work here in Baltimore and internationally," the school, a leading institution of scientific research, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopkins, in Maryland's largest city an hour's drive north of the US capital, is eliminating more than 2,000 positions - 1,975 in projects across 44 countries and 247 jobs in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts impact several key programs, including the university's medical school and school of public health, and Jhpiego, a global health non-profit organisation founded at the university more than 50 years ago and which works to improve health in countries worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Johns Hopkins is immensely proud of the work done by our colleagues in Jhpiego, the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the School of Medicine to care for mothers and infants, fight disease, provide clean drinking water, and advance countless other critical, life-saving efforts around the world," the university said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts make Johns Hopkins one of the universities most deeply impacted by the slash of federal funding for research.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university receives roughly US$1 billion annually in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is currently running 600 clinical trials, according to The New York Times, adding that Hopkins is one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging such cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Agency for International Development (USAID), the largest funding agency for Jhpiego, distributes humanitarian aid around the world, with health and emergency programs in around 120 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, who is dismantling the humanitarian agency, signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to allow time to assess overseas expenses. Critics warn that slashing USAID work will affect millions of people. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodrigo Duterte's first appearance at the International Criminal Court has been set for Friday, the court said, as the former Philippines president faces crimes against humanity charges over his deadly war on drugs.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the court late on Thursday said Duterte's first appearance would take place at 2 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old will appear before judges for a hearing where he will be informed of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed tens of thousands of people.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he landed in The Hague, the former leader appeared to accept responsibility for his actions, saying in a Facebook video: "I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's stunning arrest in Manila came amid a spectacular meltdown in relations between his family and the Marcos family, who had previously joined forces to run the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice-President Sara Duterte - Rodrigo's daughter - are at loggerheads, with the latter facing an impeachment trial over charges including an alleged assassination plot against Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte is in The Netherlands to support her father, after labelling his arrest "oppression and persecution", with the Duterte family having sought an emergency injunction from the Supreme Court to stop his transfer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The high-profile Duterte case also comes at a critical moment for the ICC, as it faces unprecedented pressure from all sides, including US sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court over what he said were "illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Gaza war. (AFP)

    Trump threatens tariffs on EU alcohol

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to slap a 200 percent tariff on wine, cognac, and other alcohol imports from Europe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's threat came in response to a European Union plan to impose tariffs on American whisky and other products next month - which itself is a response to Trump's 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports that took effect on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission had no immediate comment on Trump's post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, a neighbour and close ally that is the US's biggest aluminium provider, has also announced countermeasures of its own to Trump's metals tariffs and has taken the dispute to the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  At an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte later on Thursday, he said he would not back off from reciprocal tariffs he has vowed to impose on all trading partners on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been ripped off for years, and we're not going to be ripped off," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcohol is shaping up to be a key friction point in the brewing trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the EU's proposed countermeasures, worth US$28.31 billion in all, would apply to products that have little more than symbolic value, such as dental floss and bathrobes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the proposed 50 percent duty on US bourbon would be a significant hit for the industry, which has seen exports grow steadily since the United States lifted tariffs Trump imposed during his first term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU accounted for roughly 40 percent of all spirits exports in 2023, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Likewise, the United States accounts for 31 percent of EU wine and spirits exports, according to Eurostat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry officials on both sides of the Atlantic urged their leaders to de-escalate. "This cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation must end now!" said spiritsEurope, an industry trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump says tariffs are a crucial tool to revitalise US industries that have withered due to decades of globalisation. But US importers and distributors said it would lead to lost sales, layoffs, and shuttered businesses. (Reuters)

    Pro-Palestinian protesters fill NY's Trump Tower

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scores of people poured into the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday to protest the arrest and detention of Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, whom the Trump administration aims to deport over his pro-Palestinian activism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The arrest of Khalil, who is in immigration custody in Louisiana after his arrest in New York on Saturday, has sparked an outcry by Democratic lawmakers, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian territories, and civil liberty advocates, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jewish Voice for Peace, which describes itself as a progressive Jewish anti-Zionist organisation, carried out Thursday's demonstration. The group said it was "taking over the Trump Tower to register our mass refusal."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not stand by as this fascist regime attempts to criminalise Palestinians and all those calling for an end to the Israeli government’s US-funded genocide of the Palestinian people," the group said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump Tower, located on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, is home to the Trump Organisation and where President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump own a penthouse apartment. Their son, Barron, has been living there since beginning his freshman year at New York University in the fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 150 protesters gathered at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the New York Police Department estimated. Images on social media showed demonstrators carrying signs saying: "FIGHT NAZIS NOT STUDENTS" and "FREE MAHMOUD FREE PALESTINE."
  <br>
  <br>
  Video showed police arresting some of the protesters. The NYPD said 98 arrests were made.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaz Daughtry, the deputy mayor for public safety, said on Fox News that there were no injuries and all the protesters had been removed from the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump Organisation did not immediately provide comment. By arresting Khalil on Saturday, the Trump administration began fulfilling its campaign promise to deport foreign-born activists who participated in the wave of protests on U.S. college campuses last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States, has been a prominent figure in the pro-Palestinian student movement at Columbia, perhaps the most prominent of the dozens of U.S. universities where demonstrations erupted last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump branded Khalil a "Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student" on social media and has said his arrest is the first "of many to come." (Reuters)

    Putin agrees to ceasefire but raises 'questions'

<img alt="Putin makes his first comments on the plan, saying he's " for src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795644_1_20250314025202.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he had "serious questions" about Washington's plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but Moscow was ready to discuss it with US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Putin made his first comments on the plan, which Ukraine agreed to on Tuesday at talks with the United States, saying he was "for" the proposed ceasefire, but "there are nuances," and he had "serious questions" about how it would work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin told reporters, "I think we need to talk to our American colleagues... Maybe have a phone call with President Trump and discuss this with him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has called for Russia to agree to a ceasefire without any conditions, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying on Tuesday, "That's what we want to know, if they're prepared to do it unconditionally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Putin's statement was "promising" but "not complete."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've actually discussed many of the details of a final agreement." Now we're going to see if Russia is there, and, if not, it will be a very disappointing moment for the world," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After visiting a military headquarters in the Kursk region Wednesday, the Russian president hailed troops' progress against Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Trump pushes for a speedy end to the more than three-year conflict, his envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow Thursday to discuss the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has expressed optimism that his team can secure a ceasefire, despite Moscow's battlefield gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can get Russia to stop, then we have a full ceasefire. And I think it'll never go back to war," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier Thursday had criticised the lack of an official response from Moscow, saying on social media that this shows "Russia seeks to prolong the war and postpone peace for as long as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of talks, Putin said, "We agree with proposals to cease hostilities, but on the basis that cessation would lead to long-term peace and address the root causes of the crisis." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The bodies of at least 25 people, including 21 hostages, killed in a train siege by separatist gunmen in Pakistan were retrieved from the site yesterday ahead of the first funerals, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Security forces said they freed more than 340 passengers in a two-day rescue operation that ended late on Wednesday after a separatist group bombed a remote track in mountainous southwest Balochistan and stormed a train with around 450 passengers on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army, one of a number of separatist groups that accuse outsiders of plundering natural resources in Balochistan near the borders with Afghanistan and Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Death tolls have varied, with the military saying that "21 innocent hostages" were killed as well as four soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A railway official said the bodies of the 25 people were transported by train away from the site of the siege to the nearby town of Mach on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deceased were identified as 19 military passengers, one police and one railway official, while four bodies are yet to be identified," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers who escaped said after walking for hours through rugged mountains to reach safety that they saw people being shot dead by militants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first funerals are expected to take place on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif was also expected to visit Balochistan, his office said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean military investigators charged two air force pilots on Thursday with criminal negligence over an accidental bombing of a village last week during a training exercise, which injured at least 29 people and caused extensive property damage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defence ministry investigators have confirmed that errors by the pilots when they entered coordinates into the aircraft systems were "direct factors" behind the accidental bombing, the ministry's Criminal Investigation Command said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilots were charged with criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the command said, adding the investigation of the incident is ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight unguided air-to-surface bombs were launched from two fighter jets and landed on a village in Pocheon near the border with North Korea during live-fire exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several areas in Pocheon and neighbouring regions have training grounds used by the South Korean and US militaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents have for years complained about potential safety risks and disturbances from military units being mobilised in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two pilots have been taken off flight duties and a review of their flight mission certification has been scheduled, a ministry official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The air force chief of staff has apologised for the accident and pledged to review mission procedures to prevent similar incidents. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A US judge on Wednesday extended his order blocking federal authorities from deporting a detained Columbia University student, in a case that has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's pledge to deport some pro-Palestinian college activists.
 <br>
  <br>
  US District Judge Jesse Furman had temporarily blocked Mahmoud Khalil's deportation earlier this week, and extended the prohibition on Wednesday in a written order following a hearing in Manhattan federal court to allow himself more time to consider whether the arrest was unconstitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Homeland Security says Khalil is subject to deportation under a legal provision holding that migrants whose presence in the country are deemed by the US Secretary of State to be incompatible with foreign policy may be removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States," read the DHS document, dated March 9, ordering Khalil to appear before an immigration judge on March 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document did not provide additional detail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DHS did not immediately responded to requests for comment from reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khalil's lawyers say his arrest on Saturday by DHS agents outside his university residence in Manhattan was in retaliation for his outspoken advocacy against Israel's assault on Gaza following Hamas' October 2023 attack, and thus violated Khalil's right to free speech under the US Constitution's First Amendment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr. Khalil was identified, targeted, detained and is being processed for deportation on account of his advocacy for Palestinian rights," Khalil's lawyer Ramzi Kassem said in court. (Reuters)

    China, EU vow countermeasures against US steel tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the EU vowed on Wednesday to strike back and defend their economic interests against sweeping new US steel and aluminium tariffs, moving Washington closer to an all-out trade war with two major partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  The levies took effect just after midnight on Wednesday "with no exceptions or exemptions", as promised by the White House – despite countries' efforts to avert them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said it would impose "a series of countermeasures" from April 1 in response to the "unjustified trade restrictions" from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply regret this measure," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, adding that "the countermeasures we take today are strong but proportionate".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US are applying tariffs worth US$28 billion, we are responding with countermeasures worth" the equivalent in euros, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And China, the world's leading steel manufacturer – though not a major exporter of the product to the United States – vowed "all necessary measures" in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's tariffs would "seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system", she warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed steep tariffs on major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China since returning to office, allowing only a partial rollback for his country's neighbours while vowing fresh levies from April 2. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was turned over on Wednesday to the custody of the International Criminal Court, following his arrest on a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drugs crackdowns he oversaw while in office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old former president arrived at Rotterdam The Hague Airport in the Netherlands earlier on Wednesday on a flight from Manila, following his arrest there on an ICC request on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups and families of victims hailed Duterte’s arrest, and the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, called it “a crucial step in our continuous work to ensure accountability for the victims of the most serious crimes under ICC jurisdiction.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters of Duterte criticised the administration of current Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Duterte's political rival, for arresting and surrendering the former leader to a court whose jurisdiction his supporters dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch-based court said in a statement that medical assistance was made available "as a precautionary measure'' at the airport for Duterte, in line with standard procedures when a suspect arrives. The court did not comment on his state of health.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ambulance drove to the hangar where his plane was taken, and medics wheeled a gurney inside.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police helicopter hovered close to the airport, and later a black SUV was seen leaving the airport accompanied by police. Its destination was not immediately clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Within days, Duterte will face an initial appearance where the court will confirm his identity, check that he understands the charges against him and set a date for a hearing to assess if prosecutors have sufficient evidence to send him to a full trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Duterte could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. (AP)

<img alt="The megaphone-shaped telescope will collect data on more than 450 million galaxies, as well as more than 100 million stars in the Milky Way during its planned two-year mission. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795461_1_20250312212209.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Nasa telescope was launched into space from California on Tuesday for a mission to explore the origins of the universe and to search the Milky Way galaxy for hidden reservoirs of water, a key ingredient for life.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US space agency's megaphone-shaped SPHEREx – short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer – was carried aloft by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  During its planned two-year mission, the observatory will collect data on more than 450 million galaxies, as well as more than 100 million stars in the Milky Way. It will create a three-dimensional map of the cosmos in 102 colors – individual wavelengths of light – and will study the history and evolution of galaxies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission aims to deepen the understanding of a phenomenon known as cosmic inflation, referring to the universe's rapid and exponential expansion from a single point in a fraction of a second after the Big Bang that occurred roughly 13.8 billion years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SPHEREx is really trying to get at the origins of the universe – what happened in those very few first instants after the Big Bang," SPHEREx instrument scientist Phil Korngut of Caltech said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reigning theory that describes this is called inflation. As its name posits, it proposes that the universe underwent an enormous expansion, going from smaller than the size of an atom, expanding a trillion-trillion fold in just a tiny fraction of a second," Korngut said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director of the Astrophysics Division at Nasa headquarters, said SPHEREx is going to search for "reverberations from the Big Bang – the fractions of a second after the Big Bang that echoed into the areas SPHEREx is going to directly observe."
  <br>
  <br>
  SPHEREx will take pictures in every direction around Earth, splitting the light from billions of cosmic sources such as stars and galaxies into their component wavelengths to determine their composition and distance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Within our galaxy, SPHEREx will search for reservoirs of water frozen on the surface of interstellar dust grains in large clouds of gas and dust that give rise to stars and planets.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will look for water and molecules including carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide frozen on the surface of dust grains in molecular clouds, which are dense regions of gas and dust in interstellar space. Scientists believe that reservoirs of ice bound to dust grains in these clouds are where most of the universe's water forms and dwells. (Reuters)

    SpaceX scrubs launch of ISS replacement crew mission

<img alt="SpaceX called off the flight over a last-minute technical issue with the rocket's launchpad. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795503_1_20250313075135.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX on Wednesday scrubbed the expected launch of a replacement crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station that would have set in motion the long-awaited homecoming of US astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been stuck in space for nine months after a trip on Boeing's faulty Starliner.
 <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX called off the flight over a last-minute technical issue with the rocket's launchpad, officials said on a livestream of the launch countdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear when the next launch opportunity would be. The reason for the scrub suggests that SpaceX and Nasa could try to launch again in the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa had been set to launch a SpaceX rocket from Florida carrying a replacement crew for the International Space Station in a mission that would set up the return to Earth of Wilmore and Williams - stuck in space for nine months after a trip on Boeing's faulty Starliner. The US space agency had moved up the mission by two weeks after President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, called for Wilmore and Williams to be brought back earlier than Nasa had planned.
  <br>
  <br>
  A planned eight-day stay on the orbiting station has dragged on for Wilmore and Williams, a pair of veteran astronauts and US Navy test pilots. Starliner returned to Earth without them last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX's rocket had been scheduled to blast off from the Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral at 7.48 pm ET (2348 GMT) with a crew of two US astronauts and one astronaut each from Japan and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams have been working on research and maintenance with the space station's other astronauts and have remained safe, according to Nasa. Williams told reporters in a March 4 call that she is looking forward to seeing her family and pet dogs upon returning home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us," Williams said of her family. "We're here, we have a mission - we're just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun." The flight, known as Crew-10, normally would be considered a routine astronaut rotation. Instead, it has become entangled in politics as Trump and Musk have sought - without offering evidence - to blame former President Joe Biden for the delayed return of Wilmore and Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demands by Trump and Musk for an earlier return were an unusual intervention in Nasa's human spaceflight operations. The mission previously had a target date of March 26, but Nasa swapped a delayed SpaceX capsule with a different one that would be ready sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the new crew arrives aboard the station, Wilmore and Williams and two others - Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov - can return to Earth in a capsule that has been attached to the station since September, as part of the prior Crew-9 mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams cannot leave until the new Crew-10 craft arrives in order to keep the ISS staffed with enough US astronauts for maintenance, according to Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams flew to the station in June as the first test crew of Boeing's Starliner, which suffered propulsion system issues in space. Nasa deemed it too risky for the astronauts to fly home on the Boeing craft. This led to the current plan to bring them home in a SpaceX capsule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing built Starliner under a US$4.5 billion contract with Nasa to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the US space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from American soil. Last year's mission had marked Starliner's first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before Nasa could certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starliner's development has been plagued with engineering issues and cost overruns since 2019, putting it far behind SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which was developed under a similar Nasa contract worth at least US$4 billion. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Carney will be sworn in as Canada's next prime minister on Friday morning, marking the final day of Justin Trudeau's more than nine years in power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Governor General Mary Simon will preside over the swearing-in of Carney and his cabinet ministers Friday at 11 a.m., her office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former central banker who led the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, was elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada on Sunday. He will become Canada's 24th prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney will take over at a tumultuous time in Canada, which is in the midst of a trade war with long-time ally the United States under President Donald Trump and must hold a general election soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's new cabinet may be about half the size of Trudeau's executive, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cabinet is expected to have between 15 and 20 ministers, down from 37 currently including the prime minister, the report added, citing a source. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada on Wednesday announced additional tariffs on US$20.7 billion of US goods, retaliating against American levies on Canadian steel and aluminium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The country’s finance minister Dominic Leblanc said the Canadian tariffs that come into force on Thursday will hit products that include computers and sports equipment, and were in response to President Donald Trump's 25 percent levy on Canadian aluminium and steel, which he called "unjustified and unreasonable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The escalation of the US-Canada trade war occurred as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prepares to hand over power to his successor Mark Carney, who won the leadership race of the ruling Liberals last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has said that Canada could impose non-tariff measures such as restricting oil exports to the US or levying export duties on minerals if American tariffs persist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's hyper-focus on tariffs since taking office in January has rattled investor, consumer and business confidence in ways that economists worry could cause a US recession and further lag on the global economy. (Agencies)

 China will host Russia and Iran for trilateral talks on Tehran's nuclear programme on Friday, the Foreign Ministry said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The three parties will exchange views on the Iranian nuclear issue and other issues of mutual interest," a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu will chair the meeting in Beijing, which will be attended by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov Sergey Alexeevich and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting will follow a closed-door gathering of the United Nations Security Council in New York the same day regarding Iran's expansion of its stocks of uranium that are close to weapons-grade.
  <br>
  <br>
  During US President Donald Trump's first term, which ended in 2021, Washington withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal that had imposed curbs on the country's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the agreement for a year after Washington's withdrawal, but then began rolling back its commitments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenland's centre-right opposition Democrats have won a surprise victory in legislative elections, more than tripling their support to 29.9 percent of votes, official results showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nationalist Naleraq party, the most ardent pro-independence party which campaigned for the Arctic island to cut ties with Denmark as soon as possible, also saw its support more than double to 24.5 percent of votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two parties in the outgoing centre-left coalition government came in third and fourth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-autonomous Danish territory came under global spotlight this year after US President Donald Trump vowed to make Greenland part of the United States, saying it is vital to US security interests. The idea was rejected by most Greenlanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast island, with a population of just 57,000, has been caught up in a geopolitical race for dominance in the Arctic, where melting ice caps are making its resources more accessible and opening new shipping routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People want change ... We want more business to finance our welfare," said Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Demokraatit's leader and a former minister of industry and minerals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want independence tomorrow, we want a good foundation," Nielsen told reporters in Nuuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old will now hold talks with other parties to try and form a governing coalition. (Agencies)

    Trump's 25 pct tariffs on steel and aluminium in force

<img alt="A new wave of US tariffs sees levies of 25 percent on steel and aluminium imports. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795389_1_20250312121525.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday as prior exemptions, duty free quotas and product exclusions expired.
 <br>
  <br>
  His administration says the move is to reorder global trade norms in favour of America and its citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's action to bulk up protections for American steel and aluminum producers restores effective global tariffs of 25 percent on all imports of the metals and extends the duties to hundreds of downstream products made from the metals, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runup to the tariff deadline came with some drama on Tuesday as Trump threatened Canada with doubling the duty to 50 percent on its steel and aluminum exports to America.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump backed off those plans after Ontario Premier Doug Ford agreed to suspend his province's decision to impose a 25 percent surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York until earlier US tariffs were removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ford said he would fly to Washington on Thursday with Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc for talks with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other Trump officials to discuss revising the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident whip-sawed US financial markets already jittery over Trump's broad tariff offensive, but left unchanged Trump's original plans to strengthen the Section 232 national security tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed in 2018 during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House spokesperson described the US pressure on Canada as a "win" for the American people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Customs and Border Protection agency cut off imports qualifying for duty-free entry under quota arrangements well before the midnight deadline, saying in a bulletin to shippers that quota paperwork needed to be processed by 4.30pm local time on Tuesday at US ports of entry or the full tariffs would be charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move was welcomed by US steel producers as restoring Trump's original 2018 metals tariffs that had been weakened by numerous country exclusions and quotas and thousands of product-specific exclusions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By closing loopholes in the tariff that have been exploited for years, President Trump will again supercharge a steel industry that stands ready to rebuild America," Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip Bell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The countries most affected by the tariffs are Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the US, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea, which all have enjoyed some level of exemptions or quotas. (Reuters)

    US Education Department to cut half its staff

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Department of Education said on Tuesday it would lay off nearly half its staff, a possible precursor to closing altogether, as government agencies scrambled to meet US President Donald Trump's deadline to submit plans for a second round of mass layoffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The terminations are part of the department's "final mission," it said in a press release, alluding to Trump's vow to eliminate the department, which oversees US$1.6 trillion in college loans, enforces civil rights laws in schools and provides federal funding for needy districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The layoffs would leave the department with 2,183 workers, down from 4,133 when Trump took office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the latest step in Trump's sweeping effort to downsize the government, led by the world's richest person Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  DOGE has cut more than 100,000 jobs across the 2.3 million-member federal civilian bureaucracy, frozen most foreign aid and cancelled thousands of programmes and contracts, despite dozens of lawsuits challenging the legality of those moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  All US government agencies have been ordered to come up with large-scale layoff plans by Thursday, setting up the next phase of Trump's cost-cutting campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several agencies have offered employees payments to retire early to fulfill Trump's demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Department said affected employees will be placed on administrative leave starting on March 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union representing more than 2,800 department workers said it would fight the "draconian cuts".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, NASA announced on Tuesday the dismissal of its chief scientist and others, marking the latest in a series of administrative actions undermining climate change research.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the move affects only 23 people, a spokeswoman indicated more cuts are coming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first round notably eliminates the Office of the Chief Scientist, led by Katherine Calvin, a renowned climatologist who contributed to key UN climate reports. She and other US delegates were also barred from attending a major climate science meeting in China last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also eliminated are the Office of Technology, Policy, and Strategy, and the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Branch of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  NASA has so far avoided the deep cuts affecting other agencies, reportedly due to last-minute intervention by Jared Isaacman, Trump's nominee for NASA chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaacman, an e-payments billionaire and SpaceX customer, is seen as close to Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who has called climate change a "scam" and expressed disdain for the UN and climate science, has already pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement for a second time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, his administration has dismissed hundreds of employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the nation's other key climate agency, with more cuts expected. (Agencies)

    Maradona's medical team on trial over his death

<img alt="Fans of Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona hold a banner that reads ''Justice for God'' in Buenos Aires. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795364_1_20250312091631.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven Argentines went on trial on Tuesday accused of homicide for their alleged role in what prosecutors called the "horror theatre" of football legend Diego Maradona's death four years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maradona died on November 25, 2020, aged 60, while recovering at home from brain surgery for a blood clot, after decades battling cocaine and alcohol addictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On trial are a neurosurgeon, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a medical coordinator, a nursing coordinator, a doctor and a night nurse accused of being criminally negligent in the care they provided to the footballer in his final days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an opening statement, the prosecution said it intended to submit "solid" evidence that no member of the medical team "did what they were supposed to do" in the "horror theatre" that was Maradona's deathbed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Look, that's how Maradona died!" prosecutor Patricio Ferrari exclaimed in the courtroom, holding up a posthumous photo of Maradona, lying on his back in bed, his body grotesquely swollen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gruesome picture brought Maradona's three daughters, Jana, Dalma and Gianinna, who attended the start of the trial, to the verge of tears.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the accused] are lying to you when they say they did not take part in murder," Ferrari charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernando Burlando, lawyer for Dalma and Gianinna, described Maradona's medical team as "diabolical."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants face prison terms of between eight and 25 years if convicted on charges of "homicide with possible intent" - pursuing a course of action despite knowing it can cause death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the court, dozens of fans waved banners calling for "justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veronica Ojeda, Maradona's former partner and mother of one of his sons, 12-year-old Dieguito, tearfully thanked them for their support before entering the courthouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maradona was found dead two weeks after going under the knife, in a rented house in an exclusive Buenos Aires neighbourhood where he was brought after being discharged from hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was determined he died of heart failure and acute pulmonary edema, a condition where fluid accumulates in the lungs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The passing of the 1986 World Cup star plunged Argentina, and football fans worldwide, into mourning in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 120 witnesses, including members of Maradona's family and doctors who previously tended to him, are expected to testify in the long-delayed trial in the Buenos Aires suburb of San Isidro.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearings, adjourned until Thursday, are expected to run until July.
  <br>
  <br>
  A day nurse who found Maradona dead is to be tried separately, by jury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors accuse his medical team of pushing for Maradona to receive home care, which proved "reckless" and "totally deficient."
  <br>
  <br>
  They allege the footballer was abandoned to his fate for a "prolonged, agonising period" before his death. (AFP)

    Australia says US steel tariffs 'entirely unjustified'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington's looming tariffs on steel and aluminium are "entirely unjustified", Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday after failing to secure a last-minute exemption.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a friendly act," Albanese told reporters, after the White House dashed hopes that Australia would be excluded from blanket 25 percent levies on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Quite clearly it is not a positive step in our relationship. It is as simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's decision to slug close ally Australia was "entirely unjustified", Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship. Friends need to act in a way that reinforces, to our respective populations, the fact that we are friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the setback, Albanese said Australia would not retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese hinted that Australia may be one of the few nations to secure an exemption following a phone call with Trump in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials told Australian media overnight that the exemption was no longer on the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He considered it, and considered against it," spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told national broadcaster ABC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia is a minor global player in steel export markets but is a dominant source of iron ore, a key raw ingredient in the alloy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian steel producer BlueScope said it employed around 4,000 staff in the United States. (AFP)
