<div class="itemFullText">
 A French court on Thursday sentenced Gisèle Pelicot's ex-husband to the maximum term of 20 years jail for committing and orchestrating the mass rapes targeting her with dozens of strangers he recruited online.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dominique Pelicot, who had already confessed to the crimes, was earlier found guilty by the court in the southern city of Avignon after a more than three-month trial that shocked France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Including Dominique Pelicot, all 51 defendants in the case were convicted by the court with no acquittals.
  <br>
  <br>
  His 50 co-defendants received jail terms of between three and 15 years -- less than what prosecutors had demanded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of these defendants had their jail terms suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pelicot, the now ex-husband of the 72-year-old grandmother, admitted that for years he knocked his wife of 50 years out with drugs so he and strangers he recruited online could abuse and rape her while he filmed the assaults.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appalling ordeal inflicted over nearly a decade on Gisèle Pelicot, in what she thought was a loving marriage, and her courage during the bruising and stunning trial have transformed the retired power company worker into a feminist hero of the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stretching over more than three months, the trial galvanised campaigners against sexual violence and spurred calls for tougher measures to stamp out rape culture. (Agencies)

 French President Emmanuel Macron arrived Thursday to the Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte to survey the devastation wreaked by Cyclone Chido.
 <br>
  <br>
  Marcon will overfly the area for an aerial appraisal of the damage before visiting the hospital. He will then visit a destroyed neighborhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  French authorities said at least 31 people have died and more than 1,500 people were injured, more than 200 critically.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it's feared hundreds or even thousands of people have died after the strongest cyclone in nearly a century ripped through the French territory on Saturday. (AP)

<img alt="Emergency services inspect the rubble of a destroyed school building near Tel Aviv after it was struck by debris from the reported interception of a Houthi missile from Yemen. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784190_1_20241219161602.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A series of intense Israeli airstrikes shook Yemen's rebel-held capital and a port city early on Thursday and killed at least nine people, officials said, shortly after a Houthi missile targeted central Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thursday’s strikes risk further escalating conflict with the Iranian-backed Houthis, whose attacks on the Red Sea corridor have drastically impacted global shipping.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebels have so far avoided the same level of intense military strikes that have targeted Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, which backs the group, denounced the raids as a "flagrant violation of the principles and norms of international law and the UN Charter."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's raids came after it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis have regularly targeted Israel over its military operation in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said it "conducted precise strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen -- including ports and energy infrastructure in Sanaa, which the Houthis have been using in ways that effectively contributed to their military actions."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I warn the leaders of the Houthi terrorist organisation: Israel's long arm will reach you too," Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al-Masira, a media channel belonging to the Houthis, said a series of "aggressive raids" were launched in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa and the port city of Hodeidah.
  <br>
  <br>
  It reported raids that "targeted two central power plants" in and around Yemen's capital Sanaa, while in Hodeidah it said "the enemy launched four aggressive raids targeting the port... and two raids targeting" an oil facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said strikes on the Al-Saleef port had killed seven people, while two more were killed and other injured in the strike on the oil facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes came after Israel's military intercepted a missile from Yemen for the second time this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the Houthis claimed a missile launch they said was aimed at "a military target of the Israeli enemy in the occupied area of Yaffa" -- a reference to Israel's Tel Aviv area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also Monday, an Israeli navy missile boat intercepted a drone in the Mediterranean after it was launched from Yemen, the military said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis have said they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians and pledged Monday to continue operations "until the aggression on Gaza stops and the siege is lifted".
  <br>
  <br>
  On December 9, a drone claimed by Houthis exploded on the top floor of a residential building in the central Israel city of Yavne, causing no casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, a Houthi drone attack in Tel Aviv killed an Israeli civilian, prompting retaliatory strikes on the Yemeni port of Hodeidah.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis have also regularly targeted shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, leading to retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets by United States and sometimes British forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said the group had become a "global threat," pointing to Iran's support for the rebels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to act against anyone, anyone in the Middle East, that threatens the state of Israel," he said. (Agencies)

    Arson suspected in deadly karaoke fire in Hanoi

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire ripped through a karaoke bar in the Vietnamese capital, killing 11 people and injuring two others in a case of suspected arson, police said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pictures on state media showed the blackened multi-storey building in western Hanoi, mostly destroyed by flames, and piles of twisted metal strewn nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received reports of a fire at 11pm on Wednesday "with many people trapped inside".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue workers rushed to the scene and managed to bring out seven people alive, two of whom were rushed to hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven others were found dead, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police suspect that the cafe was (deliberately) burned down and... have arrested the perpetrator," Hanoi police said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses told state media the fire was so large that no one dared to attempt to rescue those trapped inside. Photos from the scene showed that the building's balconies were enclosed with metal bars, likely making escape difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nguyen Minh Hung, who was nearby at the time, told the Dan Tri newspaper: "We were shouting for the trapped victims, but we heard no ask for help from inside the building."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10 fire trucks and ambulances sped to the scene, according to local media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire reportedly began on the first floor, before quickly spreading through the building. State media said CCTV footage from a nearby house showed a man carrying a bucket entering the premises shortly before the fire broke out.
  <br>
  <br>
  A suspect was arrested around midnight, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man had gone to the karaoke bar to drink beer before arguing with staff, they added. He then allegedly bought petrol and poured it close to an area with many motorbikes, which burst into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident comes after six people, including four police officers, were jailed in October over a fire that ripped through a karaoke bar two years ago, killing 32 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze in a province close to business hub Ho Chi Minh City shocked Vietnam and led to the closure of thousands of karaoke bars nationwide for failing to meet fire regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than two-thirds of the country's approximately 15,000 karaoke bars were forced to close, according to state media, citing police sources. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron will be in Mayotte on Thursday, his office said, as officials warned the death toll from the most destructive cyclone in living memory could reach hundreds - possibly thousands.
 <br>
  <br>
  France has declared "exceptional natural disaster" measures for Mayotte as authorities grapple with the full scale of the devastation wrought by Cyclone Chido on the Indian Ocean archipelago, racing against time to search for survivors and supply aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "exceptional" measures, announced by French overseas minister Francois-Noel Buffet on social media platform X, will ensure "faster and more effective management of the crisis".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers raced on Wednesday to find survivors in the ruins of shanty towns while also unblocking roads and clearing rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bulldozers were clearing the heliport of the island's only hospital, as residents were busy repairing their metal-sheet huts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Located near Madagascar off the coast of southeastern Africa, Mayotte is France's poorest region.
  <br>
  <br>
  A preliminary toll from France's interior ministry shows that 31 people have been confirmed killed, 45 seriously wounded and 1,373 suffering lighter injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But officials say the toll could rise exponentially. (AFP)

    US Supreme Court agrees to hear TikTok's appeal

<img alt="The US Supreme Court decided on Wednesday to hear a bid by TikTok and its China-based parent company ByteDance to block a law intended to force the sale of the app or face a ban. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784110_1_20241219083509.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to hear TikTok's appeal of a law that would force its Chinese owner to sell the online video-sharing platform or shut it down.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top court scheduled oral arguments in the case for January 10, nine days before TikTok faces a ban unless ByteDance divests from the popular app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law, signed by US President Joe Biden in April, would block TikTok from US app stores and web hosting services unless ByteDance sells its stake by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok is arguing that the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, violates its First Amendment free speech rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress has enacted a massive and unprecedented speech restriction," TikTok said in a filing with the Supreme Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Should the law take effect, it would "shutter one of America's most popular speech platforms the day before a presidential inauguration," TikTok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This, in turn, will silence the speech of Applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts, and other matters of public concern," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Applicants - as well as countless small businesses who rely on the platform - also will suffer substantial and unrecoverable monetary and competitive harms."
  <br>
  <br>
  A TikTok spokesman said the company was "pleased with today's Supreme Court order."
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Monday, incoming US President Donald Trump said he had "a warm spot" for TikTok and that his administration would take a look at the app and the potential ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks a reversal from his first term, when the Republican leader tried to ban the app over security concerns. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN envoy to Syria called on Wednesday for "free and fair" elections after the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad, voicing hope for a political solution for Kurdish-held areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Assad fled Syria following a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), more than 13 years after his crackdown on democracy protests precipitated one of the deadliest wars of the century.
  <br>
  <br>
  He left behind a country scarred by decades of torture, disappearances and summary executions, and the collapse of his rule on December 8 stunned the world and sparked celebrations around Syria and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Years of civil war have also left the country heavily dependent on aid, deeply fragmented and desperate for justice and peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing reporters in Damascus, UN special envoy Geir Pedersen said "there is a lot of hope that we can now see the beginning of a new Syria".
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new Syria that... will adopt a new constitution... and that we will have free and fair elections when that time comes, after a transitional period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling for immediate humanitarian assistance, he also said he hoped to see an end to international sanctions levied against Syria over Assad's abuses. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A British court ruled Wednesday that police can seize more than 2.6 million pounds (US$3.3 million) to cover years of unpaid taxes from influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Devon and Cornwall Police force went to court to claim the money, held in seven frozen bank accounts, from the Tates and a woman identified only as J.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Westminster Magistrates’ Court, Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring ruled that financial transactions by the brothers, including transferring almost US$12 million into an account in the name of J, were a “straightforward cheat” of the tax authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for the force said that the Tates were “serial” tax evaders who failed to pay any tax on 21 million pounds in revenue from their online businesses, including War Room, Hustlers’ University, Cobra Tate and OnlyFans, between 2014 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Tate, 38, accused the government of “outright theft” for freezing his accounts and seizing “everything they could.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is not justice; it’s a coordinated attack on anyone who dares to challenge the system," Tate said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This raises serious questions about the lengths authorities will go to silence dissent.”
  <br>
  <br>
  At a hearing in July, attorney Sarah Clarke quoted from a video posted online by Andrew Tate, in which he said: “When I lived in England I refused to pay tax.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said J — who can't be named because of a court order — wasn't involved with the brothers' businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for the brothers, Martin Evans, argued that the bank transfers were “entirely orthodox” for people who run online businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the siblings spent money on a number of “exotic motor cars,” but did nothing illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proceedings are civil, which carries a lower standard of proof than criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Tate is a former kickboxer and dual British-US citizen who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook after the platforms accused him of posting hate speech and misogynistic comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and Tristan Tate, 36, face criminal allegations in Romania , including human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to exploit women.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are set to be extradited to the UK once those proceedings are over to face further allegations of rape and human trafficking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tates deny all the allegations. (AP)

    Japanese startup's space rocket launch fails

<img alt="Japan's Space One's small, solid-fueled Kairos rocket lifts off at Space One's launching pad on the tip of Kii peninsula in Kushimoto town, Wakayama prefecture. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784026_1_20241218170424.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Space One terminated the flight of its Kairos small rocket shortly after liftoff on Wednesday, marking the end of its second attempt in nine months to become the country's first company to deliver a satellite to space with a privately-developed rocket.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the latest in a series of recent setbacks for Japanese rocket development, even as the government pushes for 30 rocket launches annually and an 8 trillion yen (US$52 billion) space industry by the early 2030s.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kairos rocket self-destructed about three minutes into the flight, after it detected abnormalities in the first-stage engine nozzle control and the rocket's trajectory, Space One director Mamoru Endo said at a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Live images from the local Wakayama prefecture government had shown the 18-metre solid-propellant rocket blasting off from Spaceport Kii in western Japan at 11am, but whirling during its ascent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the failure remains unclear and requires further investigation, Endo said, adding that Kairos probably flew to an altitude of more than 100 kilometres until the self-destruct system kicked in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five small satellites were on board the rocket, which was headed into sun-synchronous orbit roughly 500 kilometres above the Earth's surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo-based Space One was founded in 2018 by Canon Electronics, IHI's aerospace unit, construction firm Shimizu and a state-backed bank, with the goal of launching 20 small rockets a year by 2029 to capture growing satellite launch demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  At its debut flight in March, Kairos, carrying a Japanese government satellite, exploded five seconds after launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inappropriate flight settings triggered the rocket's autonomous self-destruct system even though no issues were found in its hardware, Space One later said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't see what happened this time as a failure," company president Masakazu Toyoda told reporters on Wednesday, repeating the phrase he used in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the data from the failed launch would be useful for a third mission and that another attempt was on the cards. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia has detained an Uzbek citizen who investigators believe placed the bomb which killed General Igor Kirillov on the instructions of Ukraine's security service, Moscow's Investigative Committee said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A national of Uzbekistan, born in 1995, was arrested on suspicion of having committed the attack that cost the life of the commander of Russian radiological, chemical and biological defence forces, Igor Kirillov, and his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov", the Investigative Committee said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man said he had been "recruited by Ukrainian special forces", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov and his assistant were killed on Tuesday as they walked out of a Moscow apartment building early in the morning, after an explosive device attached to a scooter went off.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said that the suspect told interrogators that he had come to Moscow to carry out the attack and that a camera mounted on the dashboard of a rented car parked outside the building had filmed the attack and streamed it "live to the attack organisers, in the (Ukrainian) city of Dnipro".
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was promised US$100,000 to carry out the attack, as well as the possibility to settle "in a European country", the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov was the most senior military figure assassinated in Russia since the conflict with Ukraine began nearly three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov, 54, was the head of the Russian army's chemical, biological and radiological weapons unit and was recently sanctioned by Britain over the alleged use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. (Agencies)

    Judge orders Adele song pulled over 'plagiarism'

<img alt="Adele is being sued for lost royalties, US$160,000 in moral damages, plus a songwriting credit on her track. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783901_1_20241217214109.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Brazilian judge has ordered a song by British pop superstar Adele, "Million Years Ago", be pulled worldwide – including on streaming services – over an ongoing plagiarism claim by a Brazilian composer.
 <br>
  <br>
  The injunction threatens the Brazilian subsidiaries of Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music, Adele's labels, with a fine of US$8,000 "per act of non-compliance."
  <br>
  <br>
  The music companies, however, can still appeal the decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  The injunction was made by Judge Victor Torres on Friday, in Rio de Janeiro's 6th Commercial Court, pending further activity in the continuing plagiarism case.
  <br>
  <br>
  His preliminary injunction, orders Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music to stop "immediately and globally, from using, reproducing, editing, distributing or commercialising the song 'Million Years Ago', by any modality, means, physical or digital support, streaming or sharing platform".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a landmark for Brazilian music, which... has often been copied to compose successful international hits," said Fredimio Trotta, the lawyer for Brazilian composer Toninho Geraes who brought the plagiarism complaint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trotta said his firm this week will work to ensure that radio and television broadcasters, and streaming services around the world, are alerted to the Brazilian ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  His client Geraes claims Adele's 2015 song plagiarised the music of his samba classic "Mulheres" ("Women"), recorded by famous Brazilian singer Martinho da Vila on a 1995 hit album.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geraes is suing for lost royalties, US$160,000 in moral damages, plus songwriting credit on Adele's track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sony Music Entertainment Brazil said it did "not have a statement at this time," while Universal Music Brazil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trotta said the injunction should have a chilling effect on foreign singers and labels looking to rip off Brazilian tunes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "International producers and artists who... have Brazilian music 'on their radar' for possible parasitic use will think twice, given this decision," the lawyer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adele was also accused by Turkish music fans of plagiarism in "Million Years Ago" back in 2015. They claimed its tune was similar to one in a 1985 song by a Kurdish singer, Ahmet Kaya, called "Acilara Tutunmak" ("Clinging to Pain").
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaya died in exile in France in 2000, and his widow said it was unlikely a global star like Adele would do such a thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil is a signatory to the 1886 Berne Convention that agrees international protection for copyrighted works. (AFP)

    China rejects spy allegations involving Prince Andrew

<img alt="The Foreign Ministry rejected accusations that a Chinese national said to have close ties with Britain's Prince Andrew (pictured) had been spying for China. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783864_1_20241217165716.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday labelled as "preposterous" claims that a Chinese businessman had used his links with Britain's Prince Andrew to spy for Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The development of China-UK relations is in the common interests of both countries and is also conducive to promoting world economic growth and responding to global challenges," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is hoped that the United Kingdom will work with China to accumulate more positive factors and demonstrate the two countries' innate character of cooperation, mutual benefits and common wins," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the man at the centre of the row, Yang Tengbo, said he had done nothing wrong and was not a spy, after he was named in a British court as being a suspected Chinese agent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang, described in a ruling last week by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission as a "close confidant" of Andrew, waived his right to anonymity on Monday so he could respond to the accusation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have done nothing wrong or unlawful, and the concerns raised by the Home Office against me are ill-founded," he said in a statement released by his lawyer, referring to Britain's interior ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The widespread description of me as a 'spy' is entirely untrue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, British judges upheld a 2023 ban on Yang entering the UK, ruling that the the government had been "entitled to conclude that his exclusion was justified and proportionate". (Agencies)

 An explosive device planted close to a residential apartment block in Moscow killed the head of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defence Forces, Lt. General Igor Kirillov, early on Tuesday, Russia’s Investigative Committee said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov’s assistant also died in the blast, triggered by the device which was placed in a scooter, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian investigators have opened a case into the two deaths, according to the committee's spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Investigators, forensic experts and operational services are working at the scene,” she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Investigative and search activities are being carried out to establish all the circumstances around this crime.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov, who had been in his post since 2017, was sanctioned in October by Britain over the alleged use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. (Agencies)

 An earthquake of magnitude 7.4 struck Vanuatu's capital Port Vila on Tuesday, damaging buildings and cars with at least one person reported killed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vanuatu state broadcaster VBTC showed footage of vehicles crushed in a building collapse on a street lined with retailers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broadcaster reported one person had been trapped in a collapsed building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said at least one person had been killed and injured people had been taken to hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The road connecting Port Vila to the international shipping terminal was blocked by landslides, officials added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other footage posted on social media showed buckled windows and collapsed concrete pillars on a building hosting foreign missions in the capital, including the US, British, French and New Zealand embassies.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the US Embassy in Papua New Guinea said its embassy in Port Vila had sustained "considerable damage" and was closed until further notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand's High Commission building, which is co-located with the US, French and British missions, had "sustained significant damage," a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were communications outages across the country, the New Zealand statement added, while the Australian High Commission in Vanuatu said its communication systems had also been affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake occurred at a depth of 57 kilometres and was centered 30 kilometres west of Port Vila, the largest city in the Pacific island nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half a dozen aftershocks hit Vanuatu following the initial quake, USGS data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was one that had us all sort of perched and ready to move again. But none of them have been anywhere near as bad as the initial shock," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the US Tsunami Warning System cancelled an initial tsunami warning for Vanuatu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in the US, Australia and New Zealand said there was no tsunami threat to their territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia was closely monitoring the situation following the "devastating earthquake". (Reuters)

    TikTok turns to US Supreme Court to avert ban

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok on Monday asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agreed to sell it.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for the company and China-based ByteDance urged the justices to step in before the law's January 19 deadline. A similar plea was expected from content creators who rely on the platform for income and some of TikTok's more than 170 million users in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the US and significant advertising revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case could attract the court's interest because it pits free speech rights against the government's stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The request first goes to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in the nation's capital. He almost certainly will seek input from all nine justices.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, a panel of federal judges on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency plea to block the law, a procedural ruling that allowed the case to move to the Supreme Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The same panel had earlier unanimously upheld the law over a First Amendment challenge claiming that it violated free speech rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without a court-ordered freeze, the law would take effect January 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences because President-elect Donald Trump pledged during the campaign that he would “save TikTok.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump takes office a day after the law goes into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Supreme Court could temporarily put the law on hold so that they can give fuller consideration to First Amendment and other issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, the justices could reject the emergency appeal, which would allow the law to take effect as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case has made a relatively quick trip through the courts once bipartisan majorities in Congress approved the law and President Joe Biden signed it in April. (AP)

    Germany's Scholz loses no-confidence vote

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote on Monday, spelling the effective end of his troubled government and putting Europe's biggest economy on the path to elections on February 23.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholz had called the vote, expecting to lose it, weeks after his coalition collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later Monday he asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to dissolve the legislature soon and ask voters to head back to the ballot box.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the centre-left chancellor continues in a caretaker role and with a minority in parliament, the political turmoil threatens months of paralysis until a new coalition government is formed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embattled Scholz, 66, lags badly in the polls behind conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz who heads the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of ex-chancellor Angela Merkel.
  <br>
  <br>
  After more than three years at the helm, Scholz was plunged into crisis when his unruly three-party coalition collapsed on November 6, the day Donald Trump won re-election to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berlin faces major geopolitical challenges as it confronts Russia over the Ukraine war and as Trump's looming return heightens uncertainty over NATO and trade ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those threats were at the centre of a heated debate between Scholz, Merz and other party leaders ahead of the vote in the lower house, in which 207 MPs expressed confidence in Scholz against 394 who did not, with 116 abstentions. (AFP)

    Trump, SoftBank CEO announce US$100 billion investment

<img alt="Donald Trump (right) and Masayoshi Son (left) say a planned investment by Softbank will create about 100,000 US jobs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783752_1_20241217022004.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump, with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at his side, announced on Monday that SoftBank would invest US$100 billion in the United States over the next four years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said in his joint appearance with Son that the investment would create 100,000 jobs focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and related infrastructure, with the money to be deployed before the end of Trump's term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the investment was evidence of "monumental confidence in America's future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US$100 billion pledge, made at a flag-bedecked event at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, fits in with Trump's vow to bolster the US economy and reduce the effect of inflation on Americans during his second term, which begins on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump called Son "one of the most accomplished business leaders of our time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Monday announcement echoes a similar pledge Son made with then-President-elect Trump in December 2016 at Trump Tower, when Son said he would spend US$50 billion and create 50,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  While that money was eventually spent, it is unclear whether those jobs were created. The company has been rebuilding its finances after the failure of high-flying office-sharing start-up WeWork and after investors soured on some of the tech firms that it's invested in through its Vision Fund unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's unclear how SoftBank plans to fund the new investment. As of September 30, SoftBank had about US$29 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to its most recent earnings report. After a sharp decline in shares between 2021 and 2023, its stock has recovered, gaining nearly 50 percent year-to-date. (Reuters)

    Turkey criticises Israel for Golan Heights expansion

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey on Monday denounced an Israeli plan to double the population living in the occupied and annexed Golan Heights as a bid to "expand its borders".
 <br>
  <br>
  "This decision is a new stage in Israel's goal of expanding its borders through occupation," the foreign ministry said in a statement condemning the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's government on Sunday approved a plan to double the population of the annexed Golan Heights, just days after its troops seized a UN-monitored buffer zone bordering Syria as rebel forces moved on Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This step by Israel is a source of grave concern, taken together with Israel's entry into the area of separation in violation of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement, its advance into adjacent areas and airstrikes in Syria," it said, warning the move would "seriously undermine" efforts to bring stability to Syria after Bashar al-Assad's ouster.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Golan Heights is a mountainous plateau at Syria's southwestern edge, most of which was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is separated from the Syrian side by the UN-patrolled buffer zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the move was a "limited and temporary step" for "security reasons". (AFP)

    Brazil's President Lula discharged from hospital
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was discharged on Sunday from a Sao Paulo hospital following emergency surgery to treat an intracranial hemorrhage.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am here in one piece... returning home calmly," the 79-year-old leader said as he made a surprise appearance at a news conference by his medical team at Hospital Sirio-Libanes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later smiled and waved to reporters as he left the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula had successful surgery last Tuesday in which doctors drilled through his skull to relieve pressure that built up after a blow to the head in October, when he fell in a bathroom in his presidential residence in the capital Brasilia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He underwent a follow-up operation on Thursday to minimise the risk of further bleeding in the affected area of the protective intracranial membranes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president can resume activities but will need to take it easy for 15 days, cardiologist Roberto Kalil said at the news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a risk of the worst happening," Kalil said later in an interview with the Globo television network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula will remain in Sao Paulo until Thursday, when he will undergo follow-up tests. Once cleared, he will be able to return to Brasilia and his normal routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only restriction is physical exercise," said Kalil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another doctor, Ana Helena Germoglio, said Lula's recovery had "exceeded expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for his frenetic work pace, Lula burst into the news conference on Sunday without warning and approached the microphones, walking unassisted.
  <br>
  <br>
  He addressed reporters while wearing a fedora-style hat that covered signs of his operations, accompanied by his wife Rosangela "Janja" da Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula's medical emergency started when he complained last Monday of a headache while in Brasilia.
  <br>
  <br>
  An MRI scan found a hemorrhage between his brain and the dura mater membrane that protects it, prompting his swift transport to Hospital Sirio-Libanes -- the country's top medical facility -- for surgery.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I confess I was scared by the volume of fluid growth in my head. I was worried by the urgency of the request" to go to the hospital, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I never think I'm going to die, but I'm scared, so I need to follow the rules," Lula said, adding he will not go to the beach for the end-of-year holidays, as many Brazilians do.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going home now," he told reporters, "calm, sure that I'm cured and that I just need to take care of myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  After suffering his fall on October 19, Lula had told an official from his Workers' Party that the accident was "serious."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the weeks following, the president skipped planned overseas trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  But from mid-November he resumed his active schedule, hosting a G20 summit in Rio and attending a Mercosur summit in Uruguay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest medical emergency adds to a list of health problems Lula has suffered over the years, including treatment in 2011 for throat cancer and a hip replacement operation last year. (AFP)

    Hundreds feared dead after cyclone hits Mayotte

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior officials on Sunday said the death toll from Cyclone Chido's passage across Mayotte would be in the hundreds, perhaps even thousands, as France rushed rescue workers and supplies to the French island territory off Mozambique.
 <br>
  <br>
  Their efforts will be hindered by the damage to airports and electricity distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even before the cyclone's passage, clean drinking water was already subject to chronic shortages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there will definitely be several hundred, perhaps we will come close to a thousand or even several thousand" deaths, prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville told broadcaster Mayotte la Premiere.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would be "very difficult to reach a final count" given that most residents are Muslim, traditionally burying their dead within 24 hours, Bieuville added.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday pledged help from the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our hearts go out to France following the devastating passage of Cyclone Chido through Mayotte," she posted on the social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to provide support in the days to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also offered support, writing on X that his organisation "stands ready to support communities in need of essential health care".
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Sunday, the mayor of Mayotte's capital Mamoudzou, Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, told AFP nine were in a critical condition in hospital, with another 246 more seriously injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital is hit, the schools are hit. Houses are totally devastated," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm had "spared nothing", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Establishing an accurate will be doubly difficult given that France's interior ministry estimates around 100,000 people live clandestinely on Mayotte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cyclone wiped out makeshift housing in the archipelago's shantytown, France's Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said late on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mayotte's 320,000 residents were ordered into lockdown on Saturday as Cyclone Chido bore down on the islands around 500 kilometres east of Mozambique, with gusts of at least 226 kilometres per hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already Sunday, medical personnel and equipment were delivered Sunday by air and sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prefecture in La Reunion, another French Indian Ocean territory some 1,400 kilometres away on the other side of Madagascar, said a first aid plane had landed in Mayotte.
  <br>
  <br>
  It carried three tonnes of medical supplies, blood for transfusions and 17 medical staff, authorities in La Reunion said, with two military aircraft expected to follow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just northwest of Mayotte, the Comoros islands, some of which had been on red alert since Friday, were also hit, but suffered only minor damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyclone Chido made in Mozambique landfall early Sunday around 40 kilometres south of the northern city of Pemba, weather services said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll there so far stands at three, said local officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unicef said it was on the ground in Mozambique to help the people hit by the storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyclone Chido is the latest in a string of storms worldwide fuelled by climate change, according to experts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "exceptional" cyclone was super-charged by particularly warm Indian Ocean waters, meteorologist Francois Gourand of the Meteo France weather service told reporters. (AFP)

    South Korea's top court begins Yoon impeachment trial

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's Constitutional Court kicked off proceedings on Monday over the impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol, who has been suspended from office over his failed bid to impose martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes as South Korean law enforcement authorities are pushing to summon Yoon for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  A joint investigative team involving police, an anti-corruption agency and the Defence Ministry said it plans to convey a request to Yoon’s office that he appear for questioning on Wednesday, as they expand a probe into whether his ill-conceived power grab amounted to rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son Yeong-jo, an investigator with the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, said the team plans to question Yoon on charges of rebellion and abuse of power. He declined to provide specifics when asked how investigators would respond if Yoon refuses to appear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son said the team tried to deliver the summons request to the presidential office but was rerouted to Yoon’s personal residence after presidential secretarial staff claimed they were unsure whether conveying the request to the impeached president was part of their duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was impeached by the opposition-controlled National Assembly on Saturday over his December 3 martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  His presidential powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon is dismissed, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has justified his martial law enforcement as a necessary act of governance against the main liberal opposition Democratic Party that he described as “anti-state forces” bogging down his agendas and vowed to “fight to the end” against efforts to remove him from office. (Agencies)

 South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo, moved on Sunday to reassure the country's allies and calm financial markets a day after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached and suspended from his duties over a martial law attempt.

  Han spoke with US President Joe Biden by phone, the White House and Han's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "South Korea will carry out its foreign and security policies without disruption and strive to ensure the South Korea-US alliance is maintained and developed steadfastly," Han said, according to a statement from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a further attempt to stabilise the Asian nation's leadership, the main opposition party announced it would not seek to impeach Han for his involvement in Yoon's December 3 martial law decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given that the prime minister has already been confirmed as acting president and considering that excessive impeachments could lead to confusion in national governance, we have decided not to proceed with impeachment procedures," Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said Yoon did not appear on Sunday morning in response to a summons for questioning in a criminal investigation into his martial law decision, and they promised to issue another order, Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon and a number of senior officials face potential charges of insurrection, abuse of authority and obstructing people from exercising their rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutors' office did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, a longtime technocrat picked by the conservative Yoon as prime minister, was elevated to acting president in accordance with the constitution while Yoon's case moves to the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators seeking Yoon's ouster braved the cold to throng the streets outside the National Assembly building where he was impeached. The crowd was about 200,000, according to police, Yonhap said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Han's role is only acting president, "I hope he will exercise the minimum power to operate the country stably, rather than actively be involved in state affairs," said Jo Sung-woo, a 39-year-old Seoul resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 8.5 km away, a much smaller number of Yoon supporters demonstrated in the central Seoul area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really can't stand to see these illegal lawmakers who were elected by fraudulent elections making evil laws and now this huge opposition party is running wild on their own," said Yim Joung-sook, 55.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's surprise martial law declaration and the ensuing political crisis spooked markets and South Korea's diplomatic partners, worried over the country's ability to deter nuclear-armed North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden told Han the ironclad US-South Korea alliance remained unchanged and Washington would work with Seoul to further develop and strengthen the alliance as well as trilateral cooperation including neighbour Japan, Han's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said in a statement that the US president "expressed his appreciation for the resiliency of democracy and the rule of law in the ROK," using the abbreviation for the country's formal name, the Republic of Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han convened his cabinet and National Security Council shortly after Saturday's impeachment vote and vowed to maintain military readiness to prevent any breach of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spoke by phone with the commander of US Forces Korea, expressing concern about the possibility North Korea could attempt military provocations, such as launching ballistic missiles or cyber attacks, Yonhap said, citing Han's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s partners wanted to see a credible and constitutional temporary leadership put in place as soon as possible, said Philip Turner, a former New Zealand ambassador to South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will be pleased to see Prime Minister Han take over as acting president," he said. "He is capable, experienced and well respected in foreign capitals."
  <br>
  <br>
  But even with an acting president in place, international partners face months of uncertainty before a new president can be elected and a new government established, Turner added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether to remove or reinstate Yoon. If he is removed or resigns, a new elections will be held within 60 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean shares rose for a fourth straight session on Friday on hopes that the political uncertainty would ease after the impeachment vote in parliament, which followed a failed vote a week earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic Party leader Lee said the most pressing issue is a slump in consumption caused by insufficient domestic demand and the government's reduction of its fiscal role.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for a National Stability Council for Governance comprising the government and parliament to discuss finance, economy and public livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is necessary to promptly discuss a supplementary budget," Lee said, adding that such a measure could support for small businesses and investments related to artificial intelligence and infrastructure to try to head off energy shortages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament, controlled by Lee's party, passed a 673.3 trillion won (US $470.6 billion) 2025 budget bill on Tuesday that cut the government's 677.4 trillion won proposal, without reaching agreement with Yoon's People Power Party and the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law parliament cannot increase government budgets, and at the time the Democratic Party said a supplementary budget could be needed to address spending for people's livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party said its cuts were mostly in reserve funds for the government, interest costs and funds allocated to the presidential office, prosecutors and auditors for classified operations. The government accused parliament of delaying projects for small businesses with the cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deadlock over budget issues was one of the justifications Yoon cited for imposing martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's financial authorities vowed on Sunday to act as needed to stabilise markets while the finance minister said he would announce an economic policy plan by year's end. (Reuters)

    'Bali Nine' drug smugglers return home: Australia

<img alt="Some of the 'Bali Nine' were held on death row in Kerobokan prison in Denpasar. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783560_2_20241215151025.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's government said on Sunday that five members of the "Bali Nine" drug ring have returned from Indonesia, after diplomatic efforts between the countries this month to strike a repatriation deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Australian Government can confirm that Australian citizens, Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, and Michael Czugaj have returned to Australia," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men were among nine people arrested in 2005 trying to smuggle more than 8 kg of heroin out of the Indonesian resort island of Bali.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These Australians served more than 19 years in prison in Indonesia. It was time for them to come home," Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of ringleaders of the Bali Nine group, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed in 2015, prompting Australia to recall its ambassador in protest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only woman in the group was released from prison in 2018, and a male member died of cancer the same year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to convey our deep appreciation to the Government of Indonesia for its cooperation to facilitate the men's return to Australia on humanitarian grounds," Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the men's return reflected "the strong bilateral relationship and mutual respect between Indonesia and Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The men will have the opportunity to continue their personal rehabilitation and reintegration in Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia's Senior Minister for Legal Affairs Yusril Ihza Mahendra this month met Australian Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke in Jakarta and handed over a draft proposal for the return of the five prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The terms of the draft included the five being banned from returning to Indonesia, regulations on the legal basis for the transfer and a requirement that Australia respect the decision of the Indonesian court, Yusril said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yusril said at the time that Indonesia would respect any decision taken by Australia when the prisoners returned home, including if the group was granted a pardon. He said the repatriation would not involve an exchange of prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia's government did not respond immediately to requests for comment on Sunday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese police were searching on Sunday for the attacker who fatally stabbed a junior high school student and wounded another at a McDonald's restaurant, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The teens were in line to order around 8.30 pm on Saturday when the attacker entered the fast-food restaurant in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka prefecture, and wordlessly stabbed them both, according to national broadcaster NHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were rushed to hospital where the girl later died. The other victim, a boy, survived and told police he did not know the man who had stabbed them, NHK said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear whether the girl knew the man, who remained at large on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of police have deployed to find the attacker, described as a man who appears to be in his 40s, wearing a grey jacket and dark pants, according to Television Nishinippon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack happened in less than a minute, local media reported, adding that around 10 customers were inside the restaurant at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violent crime is rare in Japan, which has strict gun control laws. But there are occasional stabbings and even shootings, including the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2019, two people, including a schoolgirl, were stabbed to death and more than a dozen wounded in the Japanese city of Kawasaki in a rampage by an attacker who targeted children as they waited for a bus.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 51-year-old attacker slashed at a group of children before fatally stabbing himself. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 ABC News will pay a US$15 million settlement payment to resolve a defamation lawsuit brought by President-elect Donald Trump, according to court documents filed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The lawsuit stemmed from on-air comments made by top anchor George Stephanopoulos, who said Trump was found "liable for rape" during an interview with US Representative Nancy Mace that aired in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The terms of the settlement require ABC News to make a US$15 million donation to a fund dedicated to "a presidential foundation and museum" for Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news organization and Stephanopoulos will also issue public apologies saying they "regret statements" made about Trump during the aforementioned interview, and the broadcaster will pay an addition US$1 million in attorney fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was settled one day after Judge Lisette M. Reid requested depositions from both Trump and Stephanopoulos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had been found liable for sexual abuse -- a different transgression from rape under New York law -- in a 2023 case filed by writer E. Jean Carroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  The settlement marks the latest legal victory for Trump since winning the November 5 presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, a US appeals court granted the dismissal of charges for Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents upon exiting the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Special Counsel Jack Smith also paused a second federal case regarding Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election results, although Trump faces racketeering charges over the same issue in a case out of Georgia.
  <br>
  <br>
  And for Trump's May conviction in the hush money case -- the only criminal charges against him to go to trial -- Judge Juan Merchan has indefinitely postponed sentencing. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Thailand have arrested two men following a bomb blast at a festival near the border with Myanmar that killed three people and wounded dozens, police said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An improvised explosive device went off on a dance floor at a festival in Umphang district in Thailand's northern Tak province on Friday night, according to local police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people were killed instantly and another died later in hospital, police said. The explosion also injured 48 people among approximately 8,000-9,000 attending the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai police said they had arrested a Thai youth and a man they said was a member of the Karen National Union (KNU), an ethnic minority rebel group that has fought the Myanmar military for decades for autonomy in neighbouring Myanmar's Karen state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tak police chief Major-General Samrit Ekamol said the Myanmar suspect had thrown the bomb after encountering a "rival gangster" he had previously fought with.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior KNU denied any involvement and said the group did not have any members in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The KNU can call on more than 5,000 fighters, maintains close links with the Thai police and military, and has extensive business interests on both sides of the border, according to analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed her condolences to the victims and their families, and urged security agencies to carry out an investigation. (AFP)

 Georgia's ruling party on Saturday installed a far-right loyalist as the country's president in a controversial election process amid a constitutional crisis and after weeks of mass pro-EU protests.
 <br>
  <br>
  An electoral college, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and boycotted by the opposition, elected former Manchester City striker Mikheil Kavelashvili with 224 votes as the country's next figurehead leader for a five-year term, central election commission chair Giorgi Kalandarishvili said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A UN envoy on Saturday urged foreign powers to work to avoid a collapse of vital Syrian institutions following the downfall of leader Bashar al-Assad, as diplomats gathered in Jordan for a conference on the crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Geir Pedersen, the UN's special envoy for Syria, also backed a "credible and inclusive" political process to form the next government as he met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure that state institutions do not collapse, and that we get in humanitarian assistance as quickly as possible," Pedersen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can achieve that, perhaps there is a new opportunity for the Syrian people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top Arab, Turkish, EU and US diplomats are holding talks in the Jordanian Red Sea resort city of Aqaba less than a week after Islamist-led rebels toppled Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken, on a trip in which he met the leaders of Jordan, Turkey and Iraq, has repeatedly called for an "inclusive" process that reflects all the diverse ethnic and religious communities in Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meeting Pedersen, Blinken said the United Nations "plays a critical role" in humanitarian assistance and protecting minorities in Syria. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean lawmakers on Saturday voted to remove President Yoon Suk Yeol from office for his failed attempt to impose martial law last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Out of 300 lawmakers, 204 voted to impeach the president on allegations of insurrection while 85 voted against.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three abstained, with eight votes nullified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is now suspended from office while South Korea's Constitutional Court deliberates whether to uphold his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Han Duck-soo steps in as the interim president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court now has 180 days to rule on Yoon's future.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it backs his removal, Yoon would become the second president in South Korean history to be successfully impeached.
  <br>
  <br>
  For weeks, thousands of South Koreans have taken to the streets of Seoul to demand Yoon’s resignation and jailing after his short-lived martial law declaration sent soldiers and helicopters to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers quickly responded, breaking the military cordon and assembling in parliament to vote down the declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, prosecutors said they had arrested a military commander who headed the capital defence command.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrest warrants were also issued by the Seoul central district court for the national police chief and the head of the city’s police, citing the “risk of destruction of evidence”. (AFP/Agencies)

    France's Macron names centrist ally Bayrou as PM

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Emmanuel Macron on Friday named centrist leader Francois Bayrou as prime minister, handing him the daunting task of hauling France out of months of political crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou, the 73-year-old head of the MoDem group which is allied to Macron's party, was appointed nine days after Michel Barnier's government was ousted by parliament in a historic no-confidence vote following a standoff over an austerity budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The President of the Republic has appointed Mr Francois Bayrou as prime minister and tasked him with forming a government," the French presidency said in a statement, giving no more details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou is the sixth prime minister of Macron's mandate after last week's toppling of Barnier, who became France's shortest-serving prime minister and lasted only three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also Macron's fourth prime minister of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou now faces an immediate challenge in putting together a cabinet that can survive a no-confidence vote in a deeply divided parliament and thrash out a 2025 budget in a bid to limit economic turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was made after Macron received Bayrou for nearly two hours of talks Friday. BFMTV reported the talks with Bayrou had been "tense".
  <br>
  <br>
  Barnier, 73, was expected to hand over power to his successor at a ceremony late on Friday. (AFP)

    Russian strikes target Ukrainian energy grid

<img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaking with local residents at the site of a missile strike carried out by Russia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783385_1_20241213182214.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Friday said Russia launched a massive aerial attack against the country's energy infrastructure, firing 93 missiles and almost 200 drones.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described it as one of the heaviest bombardments on the country's energy sector since the war began almost three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian defences shot down 81 missiles, including 11 cruise missiles that were intercepted by F-16 warplanes, according to Ukrainian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A strong reaction from the world is needed,” Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has repeatedly attempted to cripple Ukraine's electricity system in an effort to disrupt civilian life and Ukrainian defence manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latest attack comes as uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether American military support for Kyiv will continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow said on Friday that Trump's opposition to Ukraine firing US-supplied weapons deep into Russia "fully aligned" with Moscow's position.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The statement fully aligns with our position, with our view on the reasons for escalation. It is obvious that Trump understands exactly what is escalating the situation," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Russia's Defence Ministry says it carried out the attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in retaliation for Kyiv's use of US-supplied ATACMS missiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said that air- and sea-based long-range precision weapons and drones were used against "critical facilities of Ukraine's fuel and energy infrastructure that support the military-industrial complex."
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar massive attack on November 28 involved about 200 missiles and drones and left more than a million households without power until emergency teams restored supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia also said on Friday that discussions of possibly deploying European troops as peacekeepers in Ukraine to guarantee a future ceasefire were premature, and added it wanted peace rather than simply a truce. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday said he saw "encouraging signs" of progress towards a ceasefire in the war-torn Gaza Strip on a visit to Turkey.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We talked about the imperative of Hamas saying 'yes' to the agreement that's possible, to finally help bring this to an end. And we appreciate very much the role that Turkey can play in using its voice with Hamas to try to bring this to conclusion."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We discussed I think the opportunity... to get a ceasefire [in Gaza] in place. And what we've seen in the last couple of weeks are more encouraging signs that is possible," Blinken said after meeting Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two diplomats also discussed the situation in Syria which is in a state of flux following the fall of president Bashar al-Assad last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fidan said that possible Turkish and US roles for Syria's future were among the topics they discussed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Turkey's priority in Syria is ensuring the stability and prevention of domination by groups deemed terrorists after the ouster of Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken said it was "imperative" to work against a resurgence of the Islamic State group in Syria post-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country worked very hard... to ensure the elimination of the territorial caliphate of ISIS, to ensure that that threat doesn't rear its head again. And it's imperative that we keep at those efforts," Blinken said in Ankara at a press conference with Fidan. (Agencies)

<img alt="South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol delivers a defiant address to the nation on Thursday at the Presidential Office in Seoul. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783304_1_20241213094512.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said it was "deeply surprised and dissatisfied" with comments made by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol that appeared to accuse Chinese nationals of espionage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon made a defiant televised address earlier Thursday in which he defended his shock decision to declare martial law and send troops to the South Korean parliament last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embattled leader also lashed out at China during his speech, accusing Chinese nationals of photographing and filming military sites in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry hit back later Thursday, saying Yoon was "groundlessly hyping up so-called Chinese espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China... is deeply surprised and dissatisfied with these remarks made by the South Korean side," ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing, without referring to Yoon by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not conducive to the healthy and stable development of China-South Korea relations," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his address, Yoon accused the main opposition party of blocking his efforts to amend South Korea's anti-spying law.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said current legislation left "no way to punish foreign nationals for espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao said Thursday that Beijing "firmly opposes the South Korean side's linking internal issues with China-related factors".
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the Chinese government always required Chinese citizens overseas to abide by local laws and regulations, and added that no conclusion had been reached regarding the case mentioned by the Republic of Korea. (Agencies)

    'Impeachment best way to restore order'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said on Friday that the best way to restore order in the country is to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol, a day ahead of a planned parliamentary vote over Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  A vote by South Korea's parliament on whether to impeach President Yoon over his martial law decree has been moved to 4pm on Saturday, the speaker's office said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the national significance and gravity of the matter, the plenary session was finalised for 4pm to allow adequate time for thorough discussions and consultations," the National Assembly Speaker's Office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's move to impose military rule on December 3 was rescinded before six hours but it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and widespread calls for him to step down for breaking the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon on Thursday vowed to "fight to the end," blaming the opposition party for paralysing the government and claiming a North Korean hack into the election commission made his party's crushing defeat in an April parliamentary election questionable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic Party leader Lee called Yoon's remarks "a declaration of war" against the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It proved that impeachment is the fastest and the most effect way to end the confusion," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon survived the first attempt to impeach him last Saturday when most of his ruling People Power Party (PPP) boycotted the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then some PPP members have publicly supported a vote to impeach him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties, which control the single-chamber parliament, have introduced another impeachment bill and plan to hold a vote on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They need at least eight PPP members to join to pass the bill with the two-third majority required. (Reuters)

    Trump extends invite to Xi for his inauguration

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has invited President Xi Jinping and other world leaders to his inauguration next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Thursday during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange, where he was ringing the opening bell to kick off trading for the day, that he had been “thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration” without referring to any specific individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And some people said, ‘Wow, that’s a little risky, isn’t it?’” Trump said. “And I said, ‘Maybe it is. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens.’ But we like to take little chances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came soon after his incoming White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed during a Thursday morning appearance on “Fox & Friends” that Trump had invited Xi and other world leaders to attend his inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  No head of state has previously made an official visit to the US for the inauguration, according to State Department historical records.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unprecedented invitations come at a moment when much of the world is bracing for what comes next when Trump and his “America First” world view return to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president-elect has vowed to levy massive tariffs against the United States' chief economic competitor, China, as well as neighbours Canada and Mexico - citing illegal immigration and illegal drugs as a factor in his decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Danny Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said President Xi would not allow himself to “be reduced to the status of a mere guest celebrating the triumph of a foreign leader.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked at a Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday about Trump's invitation, spokesperson Mao Ning responded, “I have nothing to share at present.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s January 20 inauguration is set to take place a day after the US deadline for ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of social media giant TikTok, to sell the social media app or face a ban in the United States. (AP)

    Bulgaria and Romania fully integrated into Schengen

<img alt="Bulgaria and Romania are now fully integrated into Europe's vast Schengen area of free movement. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783219_1_20241212184750.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European Union ministers on Thursday agreed to let Bulgaria and Romania fully integrate into Europe’s ID-check free travel zone, known as the Schengen area, by lifting land border controls from next year, the EU's Hungarian presidency said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bulgaria and Romania joined the Schengen area in March after years of negotiations, providing free access for travellers arriving in both countries by air or sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, land border checks remained in place due to opposition, chiefly from Austria, over concerns the two countries were not doing enough to prevent migrants from entering without authorisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Interior ministers have just adopted a decision to lift internal land border controls with and between Bulgaria and Romania,” the Hungarian presidency posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A great victory for Bulgaria, Romania, and all of Europe!”
  <br>
  <br>
  Land border checks will end from January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romania’s Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said the decision would be a “major benefit” to his country’s economy and enable “faster journeys home for the millions of Romanians” living and travelling within the Schengen area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Freedom of movement is central to European integration.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 420 million people live in the Schengen area, and their freedom to move across borders helps businesses and tourism to flourish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romanian President Klaus Lohannis called it a “natural and necessary step” that will significantly reduce wait times at borders, lower logistical costs for businesses, and raise attractiveness to foreign investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Schengen membership has been a strategic objective for our country,” he said in a statement. “Over time, there have been numerous obstacles, despite Romania’s technical readiness to meet Schengen standards for many years.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Romania would “continue to act responsibly to protect and strengthen the EU’s external borders” to manage illegal migration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Schengen Area was established in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before Bulgaria and Romania’s partial admission, it comprised 23 of the 27 EU member countries, along with Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 3.5 million people cross an internal border each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s one of the main achievements of the European project.
  <br>
  <br>
  It started as an intergovernmental project between five EU countries– France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and has gradually expanded to become the largest free travel area in the world. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's new interim prime minister pledged to protect minority rights as Washington's top diplomat flew to the region on Thursday to urge an "inclusive" transition after the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mohammad al-Bashir has said he will only remain in power until March.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the new coalition of rebel groups has yet to spell out key details of the transition process, including its thinking on a new constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You are bringing (ministers) from one colour, there should be participation of others," said Zakaria Malahifji, secretary general of the Syrian National Movement who once served as political advisor to rebels in Aleppo. He said the lack of consultation in forming an interim government was a misstep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syrian society is diverse in terms of cultures, ethnicities, so frankly this is concerning," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad fled Syria last Sunday after a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group and its allies, which brought a spectacular end to five decades of rule by the Assad clan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrians across the country and around the world erupted in celebration after enduring decades during which suspected dissidents were jailed or killed, and nearly 14 years of war that killed 500,000 people and displaced millions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joy sparked by Assad's overthrow has been accompanied by uncertainty about the future of the multi-ethnic, multi-confessional country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its new rulers have sought to reassure minorities they will be protected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunni Muslim HTS is rooted in Syria's branch of Al-Qaeda and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, though it has sought to moderate its rhetoric.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria," Mohammad al-Bashir, the transitional head of government until March 1, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera in an interview published on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new rulers have also pledged justice for the victims of Assad's iron-fisted rule, with HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani vowing that officials involved in torturing detainees will not be pardoned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jolani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, also urged "countries to hand over any of those criminals who may have fled so they can be brought to justice".
  <br>
  <br>
  Top US diplomat Antony Blinken is on Thursday in Jordan, his first stop on a regional tour that will see him offer American support for "an inclusive, Syrian-led transition to an accountable and representative government," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will call for Syria to avoid becoming a "base of terrorism" or "posing a threat to its neighbours" -- a nod to the concerns of Turkey and Israel, both of which have carried out strikes inside Syria since Assad's fall. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifa on Wednesday confirmed that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, underlining the Gulf kingdom's growing influence in world sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, a virtual Congress of world football's governing body confirmed that Morocco, Spain and Portugal will be joint hosts of the 2030 World Cup, in which three games will also be played in South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi bid was waved through by acclamation during the meeting of Fifa's 211 national member associations, with no rivals standing in its way.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a proud day, a day of celebration, a day that we invite the entire world to Saudi Arabia," said Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Faisal al Saud, the Saudi Minister of Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We intend to have an extraordinary version of the World Cup in our kingdom."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to condemnation from rights groups, Fifa president Gianni Infantino said his organisation is inclusive and non-discriminatory. “We want to obtain positive social impact," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are of course aware of critics and fears, and I fully trust our hosts to address all open points from this process and deliver a Fifa World Cup which meets expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "social improvements and positive human rights impacts" are "responsibilities of hosting a World Cup". (AFP)

Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783127_2_20241212091257.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean president on Thursday defended his martial law decree as an act of governance and denied rebellion charges.
 <br>
  <br>
  In televised remarks, Yoon Suk Yeol lashed out at his political opponents as "anti-state forces", said North Korea has hacked the country's elections and defended his short-lived martial law order as a legal move to protect democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came hours before the main liberal opposition Democratic Party submits a new impeachment motion against him. The opposition party plans to put the motion on a floor vote this Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the address, Yoon vowed to "fight with the people until the very last minute".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I apologise again to the people who must have been surprised and anxious due to the martial law," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Please trust me in my warm loyalty to the people."
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition’s earlier attempt to impeach Yoon fell through last Saturday, with ruling party lawmakers boycotting a vote at the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's inner circle has come under intense scrutiny for their role in last week's martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prison authorities on Wednesday said former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun tried to kill himself shortly before his formal arrest the previous day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former interior minister and the general in charge of the martial law operation are also barred from foreign travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  And two senior police officials were also arrested early on Wednesday. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope has spotted a young galaxy dating to the early universe – called Firefly Sparkle because its gleaming star clusters resemble the bioluminescent bugs – in a discovery that is giving astronomers a peek at what our Milky Way may have looked like in its infancy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Researchers said the galaxy, still in the process of assembling, dates to when the universe was roughly 5 percent of its current age, about 600 million years after the Big Bang event that initiated the cosmos. It has a mass equal to about 10 million stars the size of our sun, and has two other relatively small galaxies as neighbours, dubbed Firefly-Best Friend and Firefly-New Best Friend.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is comprised of 10 densely packed star clusters embedded in a diffuse arc of stars, eight in its central region and two along its extended arm. Its main visible portion spans about 1,000 light-years across. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).
  <br>
  <br>
  The galaxy is estimated to have formed 100-400 million years before its evolutionary stage that was observed by Webb, the most capable space telescope ever deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Milky Way began forming very early in the universe's history, likely around the same time as Firefly Sparkle," said astronomer Lamiya Mowla of Wellesley College in Massachusetts and the Centre for Astronomy, Space Science and Astrophysics in Bangladesh, co-lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The father and stepmother of Sara Sharif, a 10-year-old girl who was found dead in her home in Britain, were on Wednesday convicted of her murder after a trial which heard harrowing details of her treatment before her killing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sharif was found dead in August 2023 at her home in Woking, a town southwest of London, after what prosecutors say was a campaign of "serious and repeated violence".
  <br>
  <br>
  The family fled to Pakistan immediately after Sara Sharif was killed, before they were arrested in September 2023 at London's Gatwick airport after flying from Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones told jurors at the start of the trial that Sara had suffered a litany of injuries, including burns, broken bones and bite marks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara's father Urfan Sharif, 43, and his wife Beinash Batool, 30, stood trial at London's Old Bailey court charged with her murder, which they denied.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jury convicted Sharif and Batool of Sara's murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara's uncle Faisal Malik, 29, was found not guilty of murder but guilty of causing or allowing Sara's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharif and Batool will be sentenced on December 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emlyn Jones told jurors at the start of the trial that Urfan Sharif had called police and said: "It wasn't my intention to kill her, but I beat her up too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharif gave evidence and initially denied responsibility for Sara's death. He accepted slapping Sara to discipline her, but denied beating her in a regular or sustained way.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sharif, under questioning from Batool's lawyer Caroline Carberry, later said he took "full responsibility" for his daughter's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for Batool, who did not give evidence, said Sharif was violent and controlling and that she was scared of him. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police said Wednesday that security guards were blocking a raid on President Yoon Suk-yeol's offices to investigate his brief imposition of martial law, with the opposition party accusing the presidential staff of illegally protecting an insurrectionist.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is already banned from foreign travel as part of an "insurrection" probe into his inner circle over the dramatic events of December 3-4 that stunned South Korea's allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several hours into a standoff at the presidential offices, police Wednesday evening said "The special investigation team is currently continuing to discuss the seizure and search of the presidential office (with the presidential staff and security)."
  <br>
  <br>
  The main opposition Democratic Party warned it would file legal complaints for insurrection against the presidential staff and security if they continued to obstruct law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the presidential office (staff) and the security are protecting right now is not the head of state, but an insurrectionist," said DP lawmaker and spokesperson Jo Seung-lae. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes across Syria as its troops advanced deeper into the country, and the Israeli defence minister announced his country's forces had destroyed Syria’s navy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it conducted about 480 strikes over the past 48 hours on strategic military targets in Syria, days after the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Within the last 48 hours, the IDF (army) struck most of the strategic weapons stockpiles in Syria, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist elements," the military said in a statement, adding that the targets included 15 naval vessels, anti-aircraft batteries and weapons production sites in several cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence officials said Israeli ships struck two Syrian naval facilities during the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has acknowledged pushing into a buffer zone inside Syria following the overthrow of Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it remained unclear if Israeli soldiers had gone beyond that area, which was established more than 50 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel denied it was advancing on the Syrian capital of Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel intended to establish a demilitarised zone in southern Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a navy base in Haifa, Katz said the army would create a “defence zone free of weapons and terrorist threats in southern Syria, without a permanent Israeli presence, in order to prevent terrorism in Syria from taking root.” (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's former defence minister tried to kill himself shortly before he was formally arrested over his role in this month's martial law operation, a senior prisons official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers and helicopters to parliament but was forced to rescind the decree hours later after lawmakers voted it down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence minister Kim Yong-hyun resigned last Thursday and was formally arrested on Tuesday on charges including "engaging in critical duties during an insurrection" and "abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  During a parliamentary hearing, the commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service said the former minister tried to kill himself minutes before his arrest was announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly before midnight, "former Minister of Defence Kim Yong-hyun attempted suicide at the Seoul Dongbu Detention Center," said Shin Yong-hae.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding that he received the report Wednesday morning, Shin said Kim had tried to kill himself in the toilet using a string from his clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A control room staff member intervened, and when they opened the door, he immediately gave up the attempt," said Shin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shin added that Kim was now under protection in a secure cell and in good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The medical examination results indicate that the inmate's health status is good without any abnormalities, and he is currently living a normal life in the facility," the justice ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim had issued an apology on Tuesday, saying through his lawyers that "all responsibility for this situation lies solely with me".

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea is in "chaos" after President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law, North Korean state media said on Wednesday in its first comments on the political upheaval.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suspended civilian rule on Tuesday last week and sent special forces and helicopters to parliament before lawmakers forced him to rescind the decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The shocking incident of the puppet Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing impeachment and a governance crisis, suddenly declaring a martial law decree and unhesitatingly wielding the guns and knives of its fascist dictatorship wrought chaos across South Korea," North Korean state media said in a commentary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The international community is sternly watching, with assessments that the martial law incident exposed vulnerabilities in South Korean society," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Commentators described Yoon's abrupt declaration of martial law as a desperate move and that Yoon Suk Yeol's political life could face an early end."
  <br>
  <br>
  In declaring martial law on December 3, Yoon said it would safeguard South Korea "from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness".
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between the two Koreas have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles in violation of UN sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also has been bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons since May, in what it says is retaliation for anti-Pyongyang propaganda missives sent North by activists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who was arrested on Tuesday, has been accused by opposition lawmakers of calling for strikes on sites from which North Korea was launching balloons carrying trash, an order reportedly refused by his subordinates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition plans to bring another motion to impeach Yoon to a vote on Saturday. (AFP)

    French Socialists repeat call for left-wing PM

<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday gathered leaders of all parties – except the far right and the far left – for talks about forming a government, the first time under the hung parliament left by June's election that mainstream parties had sat down together.
 <br>
  <br>
  The meeting included moderate left-wing leaders willing to compromise to break the political impasse, distancing themselves from the anti-capitalist France Unbowed, which declined to join them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left Socialists are seen as likely kingmakers in Macron's bid to form a new government, with sufficient parliamentary support to make sure it survives, unlike the last cabinet under veteran conservative Michel Barnier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have come to say we are ready to have a left-wing prime minister, but one who is open to compromise," Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure told reporters on his way into the Winter Garden of the president's Elysee Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Socialists, while sticking to their calls for a new prime minister to hail from the left, have shifted since Barnier's government was toppled in a vote of no-confidence last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, they no longer insist on Macron naming a prime minister whom France Unbowed would approve of, saying France cannot remain rudderless.
  <br>
  <br>
  A source in Macron's entourage declined to say whether he would indeed name a prime minister from the left, but did say entrenched positions had begun to shift.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Socialists say Macron's decision not to invite Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) opens space for cooperation. But Green leader Marine Tondelier said the president would also have to compromise, adding "We've come to hear what concessions Macron is willing to make".
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen said she had not wanted an invitation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The president knows that, so he didn't invite the RN to the party where the jobs will be divided up." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is recovering in an intensive-care unit after undergoing surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage, the Sirio-Libanes Hospital said in a statement on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The procedure was performed after the 79-year-old leader felt headaches doctors believed resulted from a fall at home in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital said Lula, who travelled from the capital Brasilia to be treated 1,000 kilometers south in Sao Paulo, is “well, under monitoring in an ICU bed” after the bleeding was drained.
  <br>
  <br>
  His doctors later said he was "stable" and should leave hospital next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula canceled a trip to Russia for a Brics summit after the accident, his office said at the time. It left him with a cut visible on the back of his head, slightly above his neck. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in court in Tel Aviv on Tuesday to testify for the first time in his corruption case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu, who has repeatedly sought to delay his appearance in court, is the first sitting prime minister of Israel to face a criminal trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of public trust in three separate cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several people, including anti-Netanyahu protesters and his supporters, gathered outside the court, while some right-wing lawmakers attended the session, which was held in an underground chamber for security reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time he physically appeared in court was in June 2023, before the war in Gaza began in October that year. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities banned more top officials from leaving the country on Tuesday in the wake of President Yoon Suk-yeol's bungled attempt to impose martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  A day after Yoon himself was hit with a travel ban, his party was forging a "resignation roadmap" that reportedly could see him step down in February or March before fresh elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suspended civilian rule a week ago and sent special forces and helicopters to parliament, before lawmakers forced him to rescind the decree in a country assumed to be a stable democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators are probing the president and a cabal of allies -- many from the same school -- for alleged insurrection over the sequence of extraordinary events.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday Cho Ji-ho, commissioner general of the Korean National Police Agency, and two other top police officials became the latest to be banned from foreign travel, the Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already confined to South Korean territory are the former defence and interior ministers, martial law commander General Park An-su and defence counterintelligence commander Yeo In-hyung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Yong-hyun, the former defence minister, was detained on Sunday and late on Monday prosecutors filed a formal arrest warrant against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charges included "engaging in critical duties during an insurrection" and "abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul court will hold a hearing later on Tuesday to rule on whether to issue the warrant for Kim, the first court decision to be made related to the martial law chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim issued contrite comments Tuesday saying that "all responsibility for this situation lies solely with me".
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim "deeply apologised" to the South Korean people and said that his subordinates were "merely following my orders and fulfilling their assigned duties", in a statement made through his lawyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon narrowly survived an impeachment effort in parliament on Saturday as tens of thousands braved freezing temperatures to call for his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civic groups held further candlelight vigils across the country on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motion failed after members of Yoon's own People Power Party (PPP) walked out of parliament, depriving it of the necessary two-thirds majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PPP says that in exchange Yoon has agreed to hand power to the prime minister and party chief, prompting the opposition to accuse it of a "second coup".
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported on Tuesday that the PPP will announce a "resignation road map" soon in order to head off a new impeachment motion, which the opposition wants to put before lawmakers on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party's task force was also reportedly reviewing two options, including for Yoon to resign in February with an April election, or to step down in March with a vote in May. (AFP)

    Nearly 200 dead in Haiti massacre

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 200 people in Haiti were killed in brutal weekend violence reportedly orchestrated against voodoo practitioners, with the government on Monday condemning a massacre of "unbearable cruelty".
 <br>
  <br>
  The killings in the capital Port-au-Prince were overseen by a powerful gang leader convinced that his son's illness was caused by followers of the religion, according to civil organisation the Committee for Peace and Development (CPD).
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest act of extreme violence by powerful gangs that control most of the capital city in the Caribbean country mired for decades in political instability, natural disasters and other woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and voodoo practitioners who, in his imagination, would be capable of sending a bad spell on his son," a statement from the Haiti-based group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the "horrific" violence, which his spokesman said left at least 184 people, including 127 elderly men and women, dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling the bloody episode an "act of barbarity, of unbearable cruelty," the office of Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime said "this monstrous crime constitutes a direct attack on humanity".
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the CPD and UN said that the killings took place in the capital's western coastal neighborhood of Cite Soleil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The gang's soldiers were responsible for identifying victims in their homes to take them to the chief's stronghold to be executed," the CPD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reliable sources within the community report that more than a hundred people were massacred, their bodies mutilated and burned in the street," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haiti has suffered from decades of instability but the situation escalated in February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in the capital to overthrow then-prime minister Ariel Henry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gangs now control 80 percent of the city. Despite a Kenyan-led police support mission, backed by the United States and UN, violence has continued to soar.

    Suspect in US insurance exec killing in custody: NYPD

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 26-year-old man was arrested Monday over the targeted killing of a health insurance executive on the streets of New York, with investigators charging him with possession of fake IDs and a gun.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investigators continued to interrogate Luigi Mangione in connection with last week's brazen murder, which triggered a nationwide manhunt and global headlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  He arrived at a Pennsylvania court wearing a dark sweatshirt on Monday evening and was led inside by Altoona police flanked by NYPD detectives where he was arraigned, broadcasters showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione is next due to appear in court on December 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said that murder charges in New York state would follow, telling a media briefing "we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have not confirmed reports the words "delay" and "deny" – language used by insurers to reject claims – were written on casings found at the scene, hinting at a possible political motive for the crime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione was apprehended by officers following a tip from staff at an Altoona McDonald's branch, where he was found wearing a mask and a beanie while using a laptop, and gave officers a fake ID, charging documents show.
  <br>
  <br>
  They then searched him and found what police called a "ghost gun" capable of firing 9MM rounds and equipped with a suppressor that could have been made on a 3D printer.
  <br>
  <br>
  When officers asked if he had been to New York recently, Mangione "became quiet and started to shake," according to the criminal complaint.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the fake IDs found was that used to check in to a Manhattan hostel ahead of the attack, discovered alongside a document that spoke to Mangione's "motivation and mindset", New York police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, studied at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania, and had been living in Hawaii ahead of the killing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He matches the description of the identification we've been looking for. He's also in possession of several items that we believe will connect him to this incident," said New York mayor Eric Adams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police told reporters that Mangione possessed material that suggested he had "ill-will towards corporate America". (AFP)

 This year will be the world's warmest since records began, with extraordinarily high temperatures expected to persist into at least the first few months of 2025, European Union scientists said on Monday.

  The data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) comes two weeks after UN climate talks yielded a US$300 billion deal to tackle climate change, a package that poorer countries blasted as insufficient to cover the soaring cost of climate-related disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  C3S said data from January to November had confirmed 2024 is now certain to be the hottest year on record, and the first in which average global temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous hottest year on record was 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Extreme weather has swept around the world in 2024, with severe drought hitting Italy and South America, fatal floods in Nepal, Sudan and Europe, heatwaves in Mexico, Mali and Saudi Arabia that killed thousands, and disastrous cyclones in the US and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientific studies have confirmed the fingerprints of human-caused climate change on all of these disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month ranked as the second-warmest November on record after November 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still in near-record high territory for global temperatures, and that's likely to stay at least for the next few months," Copernicus climate researcher Julien Nicolas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cutting emissions to net zero – as many governments have pledged to eventually do – will stop global warming from getting worse. Yet despite these green pledges, global CO2 emissions are set to hit a record high this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  C3S' records go back to 1940, and are cross-checked with global temperature records going back to 1850. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Damascus stirred back to life on Monday at the start of a hopeful but uncertain era after rebels seized the capital and President Bashar al-Assad fled, following 13 years of civil war and more than 50 years of his family's rule.
 <br>
  <br>
  Heavy traffic returned to the streets and people ventured out after a nighttime curfew, but most shops remained shut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebels milled about in the centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main rebel commander Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, met overnight with Assad's Prime Minister Mohammed Jalali and Vice President Faisal Mekdad to discuss arrangements for a transitional government, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Jazeera television reported that the transitional authority would be headed by Mohamed Al-Bashir, who ran the administration in a small pocket of rebel-held territory before the 12-day lightning offensive that swept into Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's banks would reopen on Tuesday and staff had been asked to return to offices, according to a Syrian central bank source and two commercial bankers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's currency would continue to be used, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighters from the remote countryside milled about in the capital, clustering in the central Umayyad Square before Damascus's great eight-century mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a purpose and a goal and now we are done with it. We want the state and security forces to be in charge," said Firdous Omar, who said he had been battling the Assad government since 2011 and was now looking forward to laying down his weapon and returning to his job as a farmer in provincial Idlib.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advance of a militia alliance spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al Qaeda affiliate, was a generational turning point for the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ends a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble, swathes of countryside depopulated and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions. Millions of refugees could finally go home from camps across Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's fall wipes out one of the main bastions from which Iran and Russia wielded power across the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkey, long aligned with Assad's foes, emerges strengthened, while Israel hailed it as an outcome of its blows to Assad's Iran-backed allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arab world faces the challenge of reintegrating one of the Middle East's central states, while containing the militant Sunni Islam that underpinned the anti-Assad revolt but has also metastasised into the horrific sectarian violence of Islamic State.
  <br>
  <br>
  HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations, but has spent years trying to soften its image to reassure foreign states and minority groups within Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's leader Golani, who spent years in US custody as an insurgent in Iraq but broke with al Qaeda and Islamic State to align his movement with more mainstream anti-Assad groups, has vowed to rebuild Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new history, my brothers, is being written in the entire region after this great victory," he told a huge crowd at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus on Sunday. With hard work Syria would be "a beacon for the Islamic nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's prime minister Jalali told Sky New Arabia he was ready to provide documents and assistance for the transfer of power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fate of Syria's army would be "left to the brothers who will take over the management of the country's affairs", Jalali said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What concerns us today is the continuation of services for Syrians." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s Justice Ministry on Monday imposed an overseas travel ban on President Yoon Suk-yeol as authorities investigate allegations of rebellion and other charges in connection with his short-lived declaration of martial law last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s martial law decree last Tuesday, which brought special forces troops into Seoul streets, plunged South Korea into political turmoil and caused worry among its key diplomatic partners and neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Yoon avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him, with most governing party lawmakers boycotting a parliamentary vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the opposition parties vowed to submit a new impeachment motion against him this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bae Sang-up, a Justice Ministry official, told a parliamentary hearing that it banned Yoon from leaving the country following requests by police, prosecutors and an anti-corruption agency as they expand their probes into the circumstances surrounding Yoon’s power grab.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a senior National Police Agency officer told local reporters in a background briefing that police can also detain Yoon if conditions are met.
  <br>
  <br>
  While a sitting South Korean president has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.
  <br>
  <br>
  This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by police over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that police will forcefully detain him or search his office because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. (AP)

    Australia launches special task force on antisemitism

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia on Monday launched an anti-semitism task force following an arson attack at a synagogue in Melbourne last week which police say was likely terrorism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire early on Friday at the Adass Israel synagogue injured one and caused widespread damage, and has strained relations between Australia and its ally Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the third anti-semitic attack in Australia this year, following the vandalism of a Jewish MP's office in Melbourne in June and anti-semitic graffiti daubed on cars in Sydney's eastern suburbs, an area with a high Jewish population, last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australian Federal Police (AFP) task force will be known as Abalight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special Operation Abalight will be an agile and experienced squad of counter-terrorism investigators who will focus on threats, violence, and hatred towards the Australian Jewish community and parliamentarians," the head of the AFP Reece Kershaw told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In essence, they will be a flying squad to deploy nationally to incidents."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the attacks on the Jewish community were concerning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Antisemitism is a major threat, and antisemitism has been on the rise," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Monday, Australian police transferred the investigation into Friday's blaze to a joint counter-terrorism unit, saying the blaze was likely a terrorist attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  State and federal police along with the country's domestic intelligence service will work in tandem to identify three suspects wanted in connection with the attack, Shane Patton, Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have the best resources, best-skilled investigators, people who are expert in this field, and we will throw everything we can at this investigation to resolve it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police initially said on Friday it did not believe the fire met the threshold of a terror attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Designating it a suspected terror incident gives investigators additional resources and powers that include preventative detention, Patton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have also stepped up patrols of Jewish areas in Melbourne in order to reassure the community there, he added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's former president Bashar al-Assad is in Moscow with his family after Russia granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds, a Kremlin source told Russian news agencies on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Foreign Ministry said that Assad had left Syria and had given orders for a peaceful transfer of power, after rebel fighters raced into Damascus unopposed on Sunday, ending nearly six decades of his family's rule and a brutal 13-year civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syrian President Assad of Syria and members of his family have arrived in Moscow. Russia has granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds," state media quoted the unnamed Kremlin source as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Syrians awakened on Monday to a hopeful if uncertain future, after rebels seized the capital Damascus, forcing Assad to flee the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lightning advance of a militia alliance spearheaded by Hayat al-Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaeda affiliate, marked one of the biggest turning points for the Middle East in generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's fall wiped out a bastion from which Iran and Russia exercised influence across the Arab world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in the international community sought to take stock of a new-look Middle East following the end of Assad's autocratic rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden said Syria is in a period of risk and uncertainty, and it is the first time in years that neither Russia, Iran nor Hezbollah held an influential role there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebels face a monumental task of rebuilding and running a country after a war that left hundreds of thousands dead, cities pounded to dust and an economy hollowed by global sanctions. Syria will need billions of dollars in aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new history, my brothers, is being written in the entire region after this great victory," said Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the head of HTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to a huge crowd on Sunday at Damascus' Umayyad Mosque, a place of enormous religious significance, Golani said with hard work Syria would be "a beacon for the Islamic nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the US, Turkey and the United Nations, although it has spent years trying to soften its image to reassure international governments and minority groups within Syria. (Reuters)

<img alt="First mass open to the public at the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, five-and-a-half years after a fire ravaged the Gothic masterpiece.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An architect in Hong Kong says laser scanning of Paris' famous Notre Dame Cathedral, carried out by late art historian Andrew Tallon, played a crucial role in the restoration of the Gothic gem.
 <br>
  <br>
  The more than 850-year-old cathedral has finally reopened its doors after it was partially destroyed by a fire in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the timber roof and the structure's spire were ravaged by the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu Ka-sing, Associate Professor of Practice at the Faculty of Architecture from the University of Hong Kong told RTHK that Tallon's scans of the interior and exterior of the cathedral conducted before the blaze provided basic information for the restoration team to start with.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically, it is the process that can allow the site to create a digital twin of the historic building by collecting a range of geospatial information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu noted that the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum in China cooperated with France on the restoration, and its deputy director Zhou Ping paid a visit to France earlier this year to gain a better understanding of the restoration process.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the international heritage conservation aspect, both France and China are of the highest levels," said Yu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also given the fact that the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum [Site Museum] has also got many burned timber debris, so sharing some similarity with Notre Dame, the two sites have some good knowledge for exchange."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite rolling out the red carpet to the public, the 700-million euro restoration project has yet to be completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tasks, such as the restoration of the chevet and sacristy, as well as the installation of stained glass windows will continue.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's main opposition party said on Sunday it would try again to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol after his declaration of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, police arrested the defence minister in charge of the martial law operation, and the interior minister resigned. Both they and Yoon are being investigated for alleged insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon averted impeachment late on Saturday as huge crowds braved freezing temperatures in another night of protests outside parliament to demand the president's ouster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties proposed the impeachment motion, which needed 200 votes in the 300-member parliament to pass, but a near-total boycott by Yoon's People Power Party doomed it to failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jae-myung, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, said on Sunday that they will try again on December 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yoon, the principal culprit behind the insurrection and military coup that destroyed South Korea's constitutional order, must either resign immediately or be impeached without delay," Lee told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On December 14, our Democratic Party will impeach Yoon in the name of the people." (AFP)

 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said on Sunday it hoped Syria would return "to stability as soon as possible", after rebels said they had taken Damascus and sent President Bashar al-Assad fleeing.
 <br>

 Newly restored Notre Dame cathedral held its first service for the public on Sunday after a historic re-opening ceremony that saw firefighters, builders and artists celebrated for their work saving the 12th-century masterpiece.
 <br>
  <br>
  The beloved Paris monument nearly burned down in 2019, but has been renovated inside and fitted with a new roof and spire during a frenzied reconstruction effort since then.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a re-opening service on Saturday, attended by world leaders including incoming US president Donald Trump, French leader Emmanuel Macron expressed the "gratitude of the French nation" for the work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have rediscovered what great nations can do -- achieve the impossible," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the most moving moments came when firefighters in their protective gear walked through the congregation to thunderous applause as the word "Merci" ("Thank you") was beamed on the intricate facade and famous belltowers of the Gothic masterpiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  The architectural wonder had been in danger of collapsing during the April 2019 blaze and was saved only by the heroic intervention of teams of firefighters pumping water from the nearby River Seine.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the morning service, a second mass in the evening at 6.30pm will be open to the public, with roughly 2,500 people who secured free tickets this week expected to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cathedral will open fully to visitors on December 16 via an online reservation system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact cause of the 2019 blaze has never been identified despite a forensic investigation by prosecutors, who believe an accident such as an electrical fault was the most likely reason.
  <br>
  <br>
  Notre Dame welcomed around 12 million visitors a year before the fire, but expects to receive an even higher figure of "14 to 15 million" after the reopening, according to the church authorities. (AP)
