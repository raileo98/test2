    Fatalities as typhoon Man-yi lashes the Philippines

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least eight people were killed as super typhoon Man-yi hit the Philippine archipelago over the weekend, unleashing fierce winds and strong rains that triggered landslides and storm surges, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi, the sixth storm to hit the country in a span of one month, made landfall in the eastern province of Catanduanes on Saturday, but weakened as it moved across the main Luzon island and was later downgraded to a typhoon as it exited the landmass on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A family of seven, including an eight-year-old girl, died after a landslide in a northern provincial town in Nueva Vizcaya buried their home, the disaster office in the area said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Daet town in Camarines Norte province, a 72-year-old man was killed in a vehicular accident caused by hanging cables due to the storm's strong winds, the provincial disaster office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One casualty is one casualty too many. So, that is unfortunate," President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told reporters, referring to the death in Camarines Norte. "We will now carry on with the rescue of those isolated areas and the continuing relief for those who have been displaced."
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is approaching Vietnam with maximum sustained winds of 110km per hour and gustiness of up to 135kph.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rice-producing Nueva Ecija province in northern Luzon, farmlands and villages were flooded, worrying farmers such as Danilo Dagdagan due to the impact on crops and livelihood.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The floodwater from the typhoon and the surrounding provinces gushed here because the elevation of the land here is lower," Dagdagan said inside the living room of his flooded home. "It makes our lives difficult, it's hard for us especially for those without sufficient food."
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid has poured in to assist the Philippines in its relief operations, including from the US. (Reuters)

    Biden makes historic visit to Amazon rainforest

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden became the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon rainforest on Sunday, flagging the dangers of global warming often dismissed by President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to scrap measures to fight climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden flew from Lima, Peru, to Manaus, Brazil, the largest city in the Amazon, to meet with local leaders working to preserve the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dressed casually in a blue shirt and pants, the 81-year-old chatted on the tarmac with local dignitaries before boarding a helicopter to fly over the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the helicopter tour, Biden saw severe erosion, ships grounded in one of the Amazon River’s main tributaries and fire damage. He also passed over a wildlife refuge for endangered species of monkeys and birds and the expansive waters where the Negro River tributary flows into the Amazon. He was joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and expert on how climate change is harming the Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden met indigenous leaders - introducing his daughter and granddaughter - and visited a museum at the gateway to the Amazon where indigenous women shook maracas as part of a welcoming ceremony. He then signed a US proclamation designating November 17 as International Conservation Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Amazon is home to indigenous communities and 10 per cent of Earth’s biodiversity. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil. Scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  During brief remarks from the forest, Biden sought to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. He said the US was on track to reach US$11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a six-fold increase from when he started his term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The fight to protect our planet is literally a fight for humanity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with President Xi Jinping. (Agencies)

    Israel hits Gaza and Lebanon in deadly strikes

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Strikes by the Israeli military killed dozens in Gaza on Sunday, the civil defence said, while also hitting a Hezbollah stronghold near Beirut's international airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel has been fighting on two fronts since September, intensifying attacks on Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah after nearly a year of cross-border clashes alongside its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  A year after the Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attacks on its south, Israel vowed to stop the Islamist militants from regrouping in the north of the Palestinian territory, launching a major assault there.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest violence in the besieged Palestinian territory, the civil defence agency said Israeli air raids killed at least 46 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadliest strike, in the middle of the night in Beit Lahia in the north, killed 26 people, including women and children, and left at least 59 others buried under the rubble, said civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strike killed 10 people in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, where a separate strike on a house claimed the life of a woman, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli drone strike killed five people in the southern city of Rafah, Bassal said, adding another strike killed three women and a child in the Nuseirat camp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry on Sunday said the overall death toll in more than 13 months of war had reached 43,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the dead are civilians, according to ministry figures, which the United Nations considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Israel's second front in the north, TV footage showed several strikes hit Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, shortly after the Israeli military warned people to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Columns of smoke were seen rising over the capital's southern suburbs, where Lebanon's only international airport is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further south, overnight Israeli air strikes and shelling hit the flashpoint town of Khiam, the Lebanese state-run National News Agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the bombardment, the Israeli army said about 20 projectiles were seen crossing from Lebanon into Israel, and that some of them were intercepted. Emergency services did not immediately report any casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has escalated its bombing of Lebanon since September 23 and has since sent in ground troops, following almost a year of limited, cross-border exchanges of fire begun by Hezbollah militants in support of Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its military on Saturday said Hezbollah had already "paid a big price," but vowed to keep fighting until tens of thousands of Israelis displaced from the north can return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces also shelled the southern area of Lebanon along the Litani River, the NNA said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news agency had earlier reported strikes on the southern city of Tyre, including in a neighbourhood near Unesco-listed ancient ruins. Israel's military said late on Saturday it had hit Hezbollah sites in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Lebanon's east, the health ministry said an Israeli strike in the Bekaa Valley killed six people including three children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hezbollah said it fired a guided missile that set an Israeli tank ablaze in the southwestern Lebanese village of Chamaa.
  <br>
  <br>
  In eastern Lebanon, funerals were held for 14 civil defence staff killed in an Israeli strike on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They weren't involved with any (armed) party... they were just waiting to answer calls for help," said Ali al-Zein, a relative of one of the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese authorities say more than 3,452 people have been killed since October last year, with most casualties recorded since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced the death of a soldier in southern Lebanon, bringing to 48 the number killed fighting Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN-backed assessment on November 9 warned famine was imminent in northern Gaza, amid the increased hostilities and a near-halt in food aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has pushed back against a Human Rights Watch report this week alleging that its mass displacement of Gazans amounts to a "crime against humanity," as well as findings from a UN Special Committee pointing to warfare practices "consistent with the characteristics of genocide."
  <br>
  <br>
  A foreign ministry spokesman dismissed the HRW report as "completely false", while the United States – Israel's main military supplier – said accusations of genocide "are certainly unfounded."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, police said they arrested three suspects after flares shot near the home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the central city of Caesarea, south of Haifa, while he was away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators in Tel Aviv on Saturday reiterated demands that the government reach a deal to free dozens of hostages still held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protest came a week after mediator Qatar suspended its role until Hamas and Israel show "seriousness" in truce and hostage-release talks. (AFP)

    Russia pounds Ukraine with 'massive' attack

<img alt="A resident of Odesa salvages what he can after a Russian strike. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779593_1_20241117213812.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday pummelled Ukraine with a "massive" aerial barrage of missiles and drones, killing at least nine people across the country in the largest attack in months that Kyiv called "hellish."
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow launched 120 missiles and almost 100 drones, targeting Kyiv as well as southern, central and far-western corners of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civilians were killed in the Mykolaiv, Lviv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A hellish night," the spokesman for Ukraine's airforce Yuriy Ignat said on social media, saying Kyiv downed "144 targets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes caused massive power cuts across the country, with fears of a precarious winter to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Kyiv called it one of the biggest attacks in the almost three-year-long Russian assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A massive attack on our country," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past week, the aggressor used nearly 140 missiles of various types, more than 900 guided aerial bombs, and over 600 strike drones," he said, accusing Moscow of trying to "intimidate us with cold and blackouts."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came just two days after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the first time in almost two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is war criminal Putin's true response to all those who called and visited him recently," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said after the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need peace through strength, not appeasement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv had slammed Scholz for calling Putin, as have many in Germany itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Sunday, Scholz reaffirmed his country's support for Ukraine, saying that no decision on ending the war would be taken without Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine can count on us" and "no decision will be taken behind Ukraine's back," the chancellor said at Berlin airport before flying off to a G20 meeting in Rio de Janeiro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has been on the back foot militarily in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow's forces have made steady advances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The election of Donald Trump in the US has raised questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican blazingly critical of US aid to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses heard explosions in the early morning in Kyiv and lose to Sloviansk in the Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow, meanwhile, said it had hit all its targets, claiming it had targeted an "essential energy infrastructure supporting the Ukrainian military-industrial complex."
  <br>
  <br>
  But civilian deaths were reported across Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Kherson said a 51-year-old woman was killed by a drone.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the southern Mykolaiv region, local leader Vitaliy Kim said two women were killed in a night attack and that seven people – including two children – were wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll included two employees of the state railway company Ukrzaliznytsia in the city of Nikopol, who were killed when a depot was hit, the Dnipropetrovsk region's governor Sergiy Lysak and the operator said. Three more people were wounded in the bombing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people were also killed in the Odesa region, where a teenager was wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian drones also made their way to Zakarpattia – a mountainous region rarely hit – with officials saying fragments fell in the village of Pavshyno, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytsky, said a 66-year-old woman was killed in her car in the village of Sheptytsky – some 20 kilometres from the Polish border.
  <br>
  <br>
  That prompted Nato-member Poland to scramble fighter jets and mobilise all available forces on Sunday in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warsaw puts its armed forces on alert whenever attacks against its neighbouring country are deemed likely to create a danger for its own territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia, meanwhile, said a man was killed by a Ukrainian drone in its border Belgorod region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's energy operator DTEK on Sunday announced emergency power cuts in the Kyiv region and two regions in the east.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's relentless aerial bombardment has destroyed half of Ukraine's energy production capacity, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said on Telegram that Russian forces were "attacking electricity generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the harsh Ukrainian winter fast approaching, the country is already suffering from major energy shortfalls, while its outmanned and outgunned forces have been steadily ceding ground to the Kremlin's troops for weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv has implored its Western allies for help to rebuild its energy grid – a hugely expensive undertaking – and to supply its outgunned forces with more aerial defence weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But many in Ukraine fear that Western help will not be as freely given following the imminent return of Trump to the White House in January. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 31st edition of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Week has wrapped up with host nation Peru saying it has furthered three objectives, including fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders also issued a joint declaration, calling for a concerted effort in tackling issues such as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to local and international press at the end of the week-long Apec meeting, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte said she was honoured to have hosted the leaders of the bloc’s 20 other economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also praised the professional work of her colleagues for the past year, saying it has reaped immense rewards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those included the signing of a free trade agreement with Hong Kong, and updating the existing one with China, its biggest trading partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boluarte also reiterated three thematic priorities - trade and investment for inclusive and interconnected growth; innovation and digitalisation to promote transition to a formal economy; and sustainable growth for resilient development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before making her concluding remarks, the Peruvian leader and her counterparts got together one final time for the family photo, a longstanding tradition for the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session offers a chance for the host nation to showcase their traditional attire, but Peru decided to use the occasion to promote their textile products made of alpaca fibre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each leader was given a vicuna wool scarf from a local luxury brand. The price tag? US$1,415.
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours after the summit concluded, the customary Leaders’ Declaration was released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goals were similar to those in past years, including tackling climate change, reforming the World Trade Organisation, and achieving food and energy security.

 A drunk man on Sunday was killed by French police outside Paris after threatening officers and shouting "Allahu akbar," an Arabic expression often shouted by Islamist attackers.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to preliminary information, the man brandished what turned out to be a dummy gun, a source close to the case said. He was "very drunk," the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At around 6.00 am (0500 GMT), police were called to an incident which saw an armed man bang on a door in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, one of the police sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man threatened the police "by pointing a handgun and shouting 'Allahu akbar'," a Muslim expression of faith meaning "God is greatest," the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police officer then drew his weapon and shot the man, who died despite the intervention of the emergency services, the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to another police source, the officer fired his weapon three times, and the man was hit once. The entire incident was captured by the police body camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, aged 30, committed an "apology for terrorism" in 2019, according to police sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case has been referred to the police's IGPN internal affairs department, which is a standard procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police officer who shot the man tested negative for drugs and alcohol. (AFP)

    Super Typhoon Man-yi batters Philippines' main island

<img alt='No fatalities have been reported, but there was "extensive" damage to trees and homes. Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779585_1_20241117191753.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Super Typhoon Man-yi slammed into the Philippines' most populous island on Sunday, with the national weather service warning of flooding, landslides and huge waves as the storm sweeps across the archipelago nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi was still packing maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour after making its first landfall late on Saturday on lightly populated Catanduanes island.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1.2 million people fled their homes ahead of Man-yi as the weather forecaster warned of a "life-threatening" impact from the powerful storm, which follows an unusual streak of violent weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi uprooted trees, brought down power lines and smashed flimsy houses to pieces after hitting Catanduanes in the typhoon-prone Bicol region.
  <br>
  <br>
  No deaths have been reported, but there was "extensive" damage to structures on Catanduanes, civil defence chief Ariel Nepomuceno said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi remained a super typhoon as it hit heavily populated Luzon – the country's economic engine – forecasters said, warning of a "potentially dangerous" situation in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significant weakening" was expected as it traversed the mountainous island, the weather service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it said severe flooding and landslides were expected as Man-yi dumped "intense to torrential" rain over provinces in its path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters also warned storm surges of up to more than three metres could swamp vulnerable coastal communities, including in Manila.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panganiban municipality in the northeast of Catanduanes took a direct hit from Man-yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photos and a drone video shared on the Facebook page of Mayor Cesar Robles showed fallen power lines, damaged and destroyed buildings, and trees and corrugated iron sheets strewn on the roads.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pepito was so strong, I have never experienced a typhoon this strong," Robles said in a post, using the local name for Man-yi, as clean-up efforts got underway and people returned home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is still a bit unsafe, there are still bursts of wind and there is much debris."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mother-of-three Marissa Cueva Alejandro, 36, who grew up in Catanduanes and sheltered with a relative during Man-yi, said typhoons were getting stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before, we would only experience (typhoon) signal number three to four, but now typhoons are getting as strong as signal number five," she said, referring to the weather service's five-tiered wind warning system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is the sixth storm in the past month to batter the archipelago nation. At least 163 people died in the previous storms, that also left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather forecaster has hoisted its highest and second-highest typhoon signals over a wide band of provinces stretching from Luzon's east coast, where Man-yi made its second landfall, across to the western side of the island where it will exit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,000 people were in emergency evacuation shelters in Dipaculao municipality in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others have stayed home to protect their property and livestock, or because they were sceptical of the warnings, said Geofry Parrocha, communications officer of Dipaculao disaster agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of our countrymen are really hard-headed. They do not believe us until the typhoon arrives," Parrocha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists emptied out of coastal resorts ahead of the typhoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our facilities are deserted," said Irene Padeo, reservation officer of the L'Sirene Boutique Resort in Baler town in Aurora, as Man-yi neared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our outdoor items have all been packed and taken indoors. We tied down all the rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  On its current trajectory, Man-yi will cross north of Manila and sweep over the South China Sea on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season – most cyclones develop between July and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency said was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951. (AFP)

    Iran 'categorically' denies envoy's meeting with Musk

<img alt="The New York Times has reported that Elon Musk met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779495_1_20241116195555.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's foreign ministry spokesman on Saturday "categorically" denied The New York Times report on Tehran's ambassador to the United Nations meeting with US tech billionaire Elon Musk, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with state news agency IRNA, spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was reported as "categorically denying such a meeting" and expressing "surprise at the coverage of the American media in this regard."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Times reported on Friday that Musk, who is a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani.
  <br>
  <br>
  It cited anonymous Iranian sources describing the encounter as "positive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian newspapers, particularly those aligned with the reformist party that supports President Masoud Pezeshkian, largely described the meeting in positive terms before Baghaei's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the weeks leading up to Trump's re-election, Iranian officials have signalled a willingness to resolve issues with the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the US-backed shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, both countries have communicated through the Swiss embassy in Tehran and the Sultanate of Oman. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian state riven by months of ethnic tensions imposed an internet shutdown and curfew on Saturday after angry protests over the recovery of six bodies of people believed to have been kidnapped by insurgents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manipur in India's northeast has been rocked by periodic clashes for more than 18 months between the predominantly Hindu Meitei majority and the mainly Christian Kuki community, dividing the state into ethnic enclaves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies were suspected to be of those belonging to the Meitei community who went missing in Jiribam district after a gunfight between Kuki insurgents and Manipur police last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three bodies were pulled from a river in Jiribam on Friday while three more were found on Saturday, local media reports said.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the discovery provoked incensed mobs to attack the homes of seven local politicians, but only minor damage had been recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters also burned tyres and blocked roads in the capital city of Imphal on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Manipur government announced a curfew was in effect in part of the city due to the "developing law and order situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The state's home ministry also ordered all internet and mobile data services in Manipur to be shut off for two days in order to bring the latest unrest under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anti-social elements might use social media extensively for transmission of images, hate speech and hate video messages inciting the passions of the public which might have serious repercussions for the law and order situation," a notice said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Internet services were shut down for months in Manipur last year during an outbreak of violence which displaced around 60,000 people from their homes, according to government figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of the state's residents are living in emergency shelters, still unable to return home due to ongoing tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long-standing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities revolve around competition for land and public jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights activists have accused local leaders of exacerbating ethnic divisions for political gain. (AFP)

 The guitar described by Noel Gallagher as "the best in the world," which he played on the third Oasis album "Be Here Now," sold at auction on Saturday for £226,800 (US$286,000).
 <br>
  <br>
  The custom Silver Sparkle Gibson Les Paul Florentine guitar that starred on the 1997 album was one of Gallagher's primary guitars during the height of Oasis's fame.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was made for him at Gibson's custom shop and appeared in performances on The David Letterman Show and Saturday Night Live.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not one of the best guitars. It's the best guitar," Gallagher said of the instrument in a 1997 interview with Spin magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guitar was sold in a sale of entertainment memorabilia by online auction group Propstore. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Militants stormed a paramilitary checkpoint in southwestern Pakistan on Saturday, killing seven troops, the latest in a string of attacks by separatist insurgents, police said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The early-morning attack in the mountainous Kalat district, some 150 km south of Quetta, capital of the southwestern Balochistan province, continued for several hours, said police officer Habib-ur-Rehman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 18 wounded paramilitary soldiers, some in critical condition, were admitted to local hospitals, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed that its fighters had attacked the checkpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has stepped up its operations recently, claiming a suicide bombing last week that targeted Pakistani army troops at a railway station minutes before they were due to board a train to return home for vacations. It killed 27, including 19 soldiers, who were in civilian clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BLA and several other militant groups have been fighting for decades for a separate homeland to gain a greater share of the mineral and resource-rich Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he would like to end the war with Russia next year through "diplomatic means."
 <br>
  <br>
  He spoke a day after saying he expected the conflict to end sooner than it would otherwise have done, once Donald Trump takes office in the United States next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For our part, we must do everything we can to ensure that this war ends next year. We have to end it by diplomatic means," Zelensky said in an interview with Ukrainian radio. "And this, I think, is very important."
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been no meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine, but a Trump presidency raises questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican repeatedly saying he would end the war swiftly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to understand what the Russians want," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referring to Ukraine, he said: "You are at war with a state that does not value its people, that has a lot of equipment, that does not care how many people die."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will only accept talks with Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders Ukrainian territory that Moscow occupies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said he repeated that demand in a phone conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has rejected Putin's conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has made steady advances in eastern Ukraine since this summer, inching closer to key hubs such as Pokrovsk and Kurakhove.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said on Saturday that Russian forces were suffering heavy losses and that the adance had "slowed down" in some areas. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Donald Trump's most controversial cabinet picks just became even more so: Pete Hegseth, tapped for defence secretary earlier this week, was accused of sexual assault in 2017, according to police.
 <br>
  <br>
  No charges were filed in the case, but shocked Trump transition team officials are nonetheless reportedly weighing the next steps for the Fox News host, whose nomination took many in Washington by surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Trump nominated the 44-year-old National Guard veteran on Tuesday to run the world's most powerful military, despite having never managed a large organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in Monterey, California confirmed on Thursday that they had investigated "an alleged sexual assault" at a hotel involving Hegseth that included bruising to the victim's right thigh, in early October 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the woman's accusations caught the Trump team off guard, according to Vanity Fair, which first reported the story.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's lawyer Timothy Parlatore told the publication that the allegation "was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said that Hegseth "has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defence so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's hearing in the Senate is likely to be among the more fraught, not only due to his lack of experience but also other controversies, such as his lobbying of Trump during his first term to pardon service members accused of war crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014 and now co-hosts "Fox and Friends Weekend" and serves as a host for "Fox Nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  He additionally served as an infantry officer in the National Guard, deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accusations against Hegseth come as Trump's pick for attorney general, far-right former congressman Matt Gaetz, stunned many following his lengthy embroilment in sexual misconduct allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump himself was convicted of financial wrongdoing for covering up payments to a former porn star and found liable for defaming and sexually abusing an author.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth has been married three times, divorcing his first wife in 2009 following an "irretrievable breakdown" and "infidelity," according to the Washington Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  His second wife filed for divorce in September 2017, one month after he had a baby with a Fox News producer whom he subsequently married, according to US media. (AFP)

    UN climate chief urges G20 to push for COP29 deal

<img alt="Simon Stiell says the G20's role in progress on climate action finance is mission-critical. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779484_1_20241116180132.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN's climate chief urged G20 nations on Saturday to push COP29 negotiations towards a deal to raise money for developing nations, warning there was a "long way to go."
 <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators worked through the night to narrow their differences at the UN talks in Baku before ministers arrive next week for the final days of the summit, but major differences remain.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN climate chief Simon Stiell appealed for leaders of the Group of 20 nations, which includes the world's biggest economies and top polluters, to weigh in when they meet in Brazil on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As G20 Leaders head to Rio de Janeiro, the world is watching and expecting strong signals that climate action is core business for the world's biggest economies," Stiell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some developing countries, which are least responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions, want an annual commitment of US$1.3 trillion to help them adapt to climate impact and transition to clean energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is over 10 times what donors including the United States, the European Union and Japan currently pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the negotiations are stuck over a final figure, the type of financing and who should pay, with developed countries wanting China and wealthy Gulf states to join the list of donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest draft deal was 25 pages long, and still contained a raft of options.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here in Baku negotiators are working around the clock on a new climate finance goal," Stiell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a long way to go, but everyone is very aware of the stakes, at the halfway point in the COP," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Climate finance progress outside of our process is equally crucial, and the G20's role is mission-critical." (AFP)

    Philippines braces for impact of Super Typhoon Man-yi

<img alt="Man-yi will be the sixth major storm to batter the Philippines in the past month. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779477_1_20241116162508.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A super typhoon sweeping towards the Philippines on Saturday was intensifying and could have a "potentially catastrophic" impact, the state weather forecaster warned, with millions of people at risk from storm surges.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 650,000 people have fled their homes ahead of Super Typhoon Man-yi, which is expected to make landfall later on Saturday or early on Sunday, becoming the sixth major storm to pummel the archipelago nation in the past month.
  <br>
  <br>
  With wind gusts of up to 240 kilometres per hour, Man-yi was on track to slam into the sparsely populated island province of Catanduanes as a super typhoon or "near peak intensity", the weather service warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially catastrophic and life-threatening situation looms for northeastern Bicol region as Super Typhoon 'Pepito' further intensifies," the forecaster said in its latest update, using the local name for the storm and referring to the southern part of the main island of Luzon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to 14-metre high seas were expected around Catanduanes, while more than 7.6 million people were at risk from storm surges of one to three metres, the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 163 people died in the five storms that pounded the Philippines in recent weeks that also left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government urged people on Saturday to heed warnings to flee to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If preemptive evacuation is required, let us do so and not wait for the hour of peril before evacuating or seeking help, because if we did that we would be putting in danger not only our lives but also those of our rescuers," Interior Undersecretary Marlo Iringan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Albay province, Legazpi City grocer Myrna Perea was sheltering with her fruit vendor husband and their three children in a school classroom with nine other families after they were ordered to leave their shanty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conditions were hot and cramped – the family spent Friday night sleeping together on a mat under the classroom's single ceiling fan – but Perea said it was better to be safe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think our house will be wrecked when we get back because it's made of light materials – just two gusts are required to knock it down," said Perea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why we evacuated. Even if the house is destroyed, the important thing is we do not lose a family member."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists have warned climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuation centres were filling up on Catanduanes island in the typhoon-prone Bicol region, with the weather forecaster warning of "widespread incidents of severe flooding and landslides."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 400 people were squeezed into the provincial government building in the capital Virac, with new arrivals being sent to a gymnasium, said provincial disaster officer Roberto Monterola.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monterola said he had dispatched soldiers to force about 100 households in two coastal villages near Virac to move inland due to fears storm surges could swamp their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regardless of the exact landfall point, heavy rainfall, severe winds, and storm surges may occur in areas outside the predicted landfall zone," the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Naga city in Camarines Sur province imposed a curfew from midday on Saturday in a bid to force residents indoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Northern Samar province, disaster officer Rei Josiah Echano lamented that damage caused by typhoons was the root cause of poverty in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whenever there's a typhoon like this, it brings us back to the mediaeval era, we go (back) to square one," Echano said, as the province prepared for the onslaught of Man-yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  All vessels – from fishing boats to oil tankers – have been ordered to stay in port or return to shore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 4,000 people were stranded after the coast guard shut 55 ports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcanology agency also warned heavy rain dumped by Man-yi could trigger flows of volcanic sediment, or lahars, from three volcanos, including Taal, south of Manila.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi will hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season – most cyclones develop between July and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency said on Saturday was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951. (AFP)

    10 newborns killed, 16 critical in India hospital fire

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire at the neonatal unit of an Indian hospital killed 10 newborns, authorities said on Saturday, with another 16 clinging to life after a blaze blamed on a faulty oxygen machine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Building fires are common in India due to shoddy construction and a routine disregard for safety regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday night's fire broke out at about 10:30 pm (1700 GMT) at the Maharani Lakshmibai Medical College in Jhansi, around 450 kilometres south of the capital New Delhi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage from the scene showed charred beds and walls inside the ward as a crowd of anguished families waited outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Babies rescued from the fire, all only days old, were laid side by side on a bed elsewhere in the hospital as staff hooked up their arms to intravenous drips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten infants have sadly died," Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seven bodies have been identified. Three bodies haven't been identified as yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 16 infants were in critical condition after the blaze, news outlet Times Now reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pathak said a safety audit of the hospital was carried out in February followed by a fire drill three months later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of the fire will be probed," he added. "If any lapses are found, strict action will be taken against those responsible and no one will be spared."
  <br>
  <br>
  District official Avinash Kumar said the fire had been caused by an electrical short circuit in the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are providing medical care to the critically injured," he was quoted as saying by the Hindustan Times newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reports quoted other officials who said the fire started in a piece of machinery used to enrich the level of oxygen in the atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The high concentration of the combustible gas in the unit helped the fire spread quickly and suddenly, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster NDTV reported that 54 infants in total were in the neonatal intensive care unit when the fire broke out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the deaths "heart-wrenching" in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My deepest condolences to those who have lost their innocent children in this. I pray to God to give them the strength to bear this immense loss," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced compensation of 500,000 rupees (US$5,900) to bereaved families.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The district administration and concerned officials have been instructed to carry out relief and rescue operations on a war footing," Adityanath wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I pray to Lord Shri Ram to provide salvation to the departed souls and speedy recovery to the injured."
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's fire comes six months after a similar blaze at a children's hospital in New Delhi that killed six newborns. (AFP)

 Chief Executive John Lee had his most hectic day yet in his week-long visit of Peru, signing a free trade agreement with the nation and meeting with the leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also attended an informal dialogue on Friday, Lima time, briefing regional leaders on the SAR’s strengths as well as its role in China’s Belt and Road initiative and Apec development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong leader then met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for the first time since July last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked Anwar for supporting the SAR’s plan to establish an Economic and Trade Office in Kuala Lumpur, the fourth in the region known as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also congratulated Malaysia for taking the chairmanship of Asean next year, and hoped the nation will continue to support Hong Kong's early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or Rcep.
  <br>
  <br>
  After attending another Apec dialogue where he exchanged views Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Lee had two more bilateral meeting with Vietnamese President Luong Cuong and Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries are key trading partners of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader’s day culminated in the signing of the FTA between Hong Kong and Peru, and he got to relax by watching cultural performances at an Apec gala dinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Lima time, Lee will attend the Apec Economic Leaders' meeting retreat and meet with Peruvian business sector representatives.

<img alt='President Xi Jinping has told his Japanese counterpart, Shigeru Ishiba, Beijing is ready to work with Tokyo  "in accordance with the principles and directions set out in the four political documents" between the two countries. Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779446_1_20241116120529.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping told Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in their first meeting that China hoped Japan would "properly handle" major issues such as history and Taiwan, according to state media on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi called for the two Asian neighbours to safeguard the global free trade system, as well as stable and unimpeded production and supply chains, as they met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum summit in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that China is ready to work with Japan "in accordance with the principles and directions set out in the four political documents" between the two countries, and adhere to the important consensus that they are "cooperative partners rather than threats to each other", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Japan are close neighbours and important countries in Asia and the world, Xi said, adding that bilateral relations bears significance beyond bilateral dimension.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba told Xi that Japan's position on the Taiwan question, based on the Japan-China joint communique in 1972, remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese prime minister also said he wanted to build a "constructive and stable" relationship, and that Tokyo has no intention of decoupling from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a summit for the first time in two years on the sidelines of Apec.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi told Yoon that "the international and regional situations have undergone many changes" over the past two years, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how the situation changes, China and South Korea should stick to the original intention in establishing diplomatic ties, firmly adhere to the direction of good-neighbourliness and friendship, and remain committed to the goal of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon told his Chinese counterpart that their two countries should cooperate for peace in the face of North Korea and Russia's military cooperation, according to the South Korean President's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon expressed his hope that "South Korea and China will cooperate in promoting stability and peace in the region in response to North Korea's successive provocations, the war in Ukraine, and Russia-North Korea military cooperation", his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also called for the two countries to further strengthen cooperation in the economic sector, which he called "the central axis of bilateral relations over the past 30 years", Yoon's office said. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has warned that the world is entering an era of harmful "protectionism", in remarks to an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of what will be his final official face-to-face with outgoing US President Joe Biden, Xi raised concern about "spreading unilateralism and protectionism", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also quoted Xi as cautioning against "fragmentation of the world economy" in a written speech prepared for a meeting of CEOs on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi and Biden are in the Peruvian capital for a two-day meeting of heads of state of the 21-member Apec grouping.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the sitting leaders of the world's two largest economies will have their final official encounter before Trump takes office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his prepared remarks reported by Xinhua, Xi said the world had "entered a new period of turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said attempts to use pretexts to block economic cooperation and to break up the interdependence of the world were nothing but back-pedalling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should see to it that economic globalisation generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the principles of "plan together, build together and benefit together" should be followed, the representation and voice of the Global South should be enhanced continuously, and all countries should be ensured of equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules in conducting international economic cooperation.

    Hamas official says 'ready' for Gaza ceasefire

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Hamas official said on Friday that the group is "ready for a ceasefire" in Gaza and urged US President-elect Donald Trump to pressure Israel to end the war.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas is ready to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip if a ceasefire proposal is presented and on the condition that it is respected" by Israel, said Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We call on the US administration and Trump to pressure the Israeli government to end the aggression.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas informed the mediators that it is in favour of any proposal submitted to it that would lead to a definitive ceasefire and military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, allowing the return of displaced people, a serious deal for a prisoner exchange, the entry of humanitarian aid and reconstruction," Naim added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demands are the same ones Hamas has made in successive rounds of ceasefire negotiations since the start of the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign trail, Trump promised peace in the Middle East and has vowed to give freer rein to Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naim's comments come after Qatar said on Saturday that it had suspended its role as a key mediator for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal until Hamas and Israel show "seriousness" in talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gulf emirate, which has hosted Hamas's political leadership since 2012 with US blessing, has been involved in months of protracted diplomacy aimed at ending the war triggered by the Palestinian group's attack on Israel on October 7 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,764 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

    Spanish regional leader admits 'mistakes' over floods

<img alt="Carlos Mazon admits he was having lunch on the afternoon of the disaster. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779377_1_20241115203421.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Spain's eastern Valencia region admitted on Friday to "mistakes" in handling the country's deadliest floods in decades that killed 216 people there and apologised.
 <br>
  <br>
  The October 29 disaster claimed 224 lives nationwide. The floods wrecked infrastructure, gutted buildings and submerged fields.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final bill is expected to soar to tens of billions of euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to deny mistakes," Carlos Mazon told Valencia's regional parliament, adding he was "not going to shirk any responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  As the head of the regional government "I would like to apologise" to those who "felt" that "the aid did not arrive or was not enough," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he spoke, dozens of protesters gathered outside the building, jeering and chanting slogans demanding his resignation and calling him a liar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost half the people killed in Valencia were 70 years old or older and 26 were foreigners, including two Britons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outrage at the authorities for their perceived mismanagement before and after the floods triggered mass protests on Saturday, the largest in Valencia city which drew 130,000 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several carried placards that read: "Our hands are stained with mud, theirs with blood."
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics have questioned the efficiency of the Valencia region's alert system. In some cases, residents were only contacted by telephone when floodwater was already gushing through towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergency alert was only sent after 8 pm, nearly 13 hours after the state weather agency warned of the risk of "very intense" rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of Valencia's emergency department admitted she did not learn it was possible to send such warnings until the evening of the first day of the floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Spain's decentralised system of government, regional governments lead disaster response.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's Socialist-led central government has said Mazon's administration, run by the conservative Popular Party (PP), bore responsibility for not issuing the alert earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mazon has also come under fire for having been missing for several critical hours on the afternoon of the disaster when it was already raining heavily.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to repeated questions for explanations for his absence, he finally admitted he had been having lunch with a journalist to offer her the directorship of the regional television station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many residents have complained they were left without food and water for days and had to rely on aid provided by volunteers instead of the government. (AFP)

    COP29 summit denounced as 'no longer fit for purpose'

<img alt="A coalition of NGOs says more than 1,700 people linked to fossil fuel interests are attending COP29. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779379_1_20241115205149.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oil executives and lobbyists descended on COP29 in Baku for "energy day" on Friday, as environmental groups denounced the presence of the fossil fuel industry at the UN climate talks.
 <br>
  <br>
  While negotiators haggled over the key goal of an increase in climate funding, a former UN chief denounced the talks as "no longer fit for purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of France's TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, said the sector is "part of the problem," but insisted it was making "continuous progress" on transition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Kick the Big Polluters Out" (KBPO) coalition of NGOs analysed accreditations at the annual climate confab, calculating that more than 1,700 people linked to fossil fuel interests are in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fossil fuel industry is creating havoc in people's lives, the fossil fuel industry is responsible for destruction," said Makoma Lekalakala, a South African environmental campaigner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The presence of oil, gas and coal interests at the climate talks has long been a source of controversy, and the appointment of UAE state oil firm head Sultan Al Jaber to head last year's negotiations in Dubai stoked criticism.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's host is energy-rich Azerbaijan, whose President Ilham Aliyev on Tuesday repeated his insistence that oil and gas are a "gift of God."
  <br>
  <br>
  Former US vice president and climate activist Al Gore warned on Thursday that "the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Dubai summit produced a global agreement on "transitioning away" from fossil fuels, the follow-up commitment "has been very weak" and the issue "is hardly even mentioned" at COP29, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to think that one of the reasons for that is that the petrostates have too much control over the process."
  <br>
  <br>
  A group of leading climate activists and scientists including former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned on Friday that the COP process was "no longer fit for purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  They urged smaller, more frequent meetings, strict criteria for host countries and rules to ensure companies showed clear climate commitments before being allowed to send lobbyists to the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michai Robertson, lead negotiator on climate change for the Alliance of Small Island States, said the talks remained crucial for vulnerable nations shut out of forums like the G20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is the only time that our voice can be clearly heard," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  KBPO said Japan brought employees of coal giant Sumitomo as part of its delegation, Canada included oil producers Suncor and Tourmaline and Italy brought employees of energy giants Eni and Enel.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, some of those on the NGO list work for companies that are not primarily fossil fuel-related, including Danish offshore wind champion Orsted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top priority at the talks is a new figure for climate finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change and transition their economies away from fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rich nations are reluctant to spend much more than the US$100 billion a year already committed, conscious of domestic publics angry about inflation and stuttering economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But developing countries warn they need at least US$1 trillion to defend against the ravages of climate change and meet commitments to reach net-zero emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators are struggling to agree on a workable draft text before ministers arrive next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must be honest, we believe that the pace of their work is currently too slow," warned COP29 lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev on Friday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hanging over proceedings is the question of what role the United States will play on climate action and funding after Donald Trump returns to the White House in January, given his pledge to again withdraw from the landmark Paris agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  American officials at the talks have insisted Trump will struggle to undo the climate action already in motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When history is written, he will be looked at as a speed bump on the tremendous growth of this clean energy transition," the Democratic governor of Washington state, Jay Inslee, told an event on Friday. (AFP)

<img alt="Punjab's environment minister has urged residents to " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779387_1_20241115215108.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan's most populated province of Punjab on Friday extended school closures in smog-hit major cities by a week, as the country battles record air pollution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The schools will remain closed for another week due to the hazardous air quality. Institutes including universities would switch to online classes to ensure the safety of students," Marriyum Aurangzeb, Punjab's environment minister, told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Air quality in Lahore was deemed "hazardous," according to data from IQAir, with the concentration of deadly PM2.5 pollutants – fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health – around 30 times the level deemed acceptable by the World Health Organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 35,000 patients have been reported in the hospitals of Lahore due to smog-related health issues in almost a month," Aurangzeb added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also urged residents to "stop roaming around on bikes and in cars and to wear masks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The province, home to more than half of Pakistan's 240 million people, had previously closed all schools until November 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  A mix of low-grade fuel emissions from factories and vehicles, exacerbated by agricultural burning, blanket the city each winter, trapped by cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN's food agency says transport is the main cause of air pollution in Pakistan, followed by industry and agriculture.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children are often hardest hit, with Unicef noting that "prior to these record-breaking levels of air pollution, about 12 percent of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were due to air pollution." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A collection of guitars and other musical equipment owned by influential rock guitarist Jeff Beck will go on sale in London in January, Christie's auctioneers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the 130 guitars, amps and "tools of the trade" used by Beck during his decades-spanning career are expected to fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds (dollars) when they go under the hammer on January 22, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include the rock legend's 1954 "Oxblood" Gibson Les Paul, famously depicted on the cover of his seminal 1975 solo instrumental album "Blow By Blow" and used on several tracks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is estimated to fetch up to £500,000 (US$634,000).
  <br>
  <br>
  Beck, who rose to stardom with 1960s supergroup The Yardbirds and later enjoyed a prolific solo career, died in January last year aged 78.
  <br>
  <br>
  His widow, Sandra Beck, said it was "a massive wrench" to part with the instruments but that they needed to be "shared, played and loved again."
  <br>
  <br>
  "These guitars were his great love and after almost two years of his passing, it's time to part with them as Jeff wished," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the future guitarists who acquire these items are able to move closer to the genius who played them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The collection includes another Gibson Les Paul from 1958, dubbed the original "Yardburst" as it was bought in 1966 while Beck was in the seminal British rock group. It is valued at up to £60,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Fender Telecaster and Gibson hybrid crafted by world-renowned guitar designer Seymour Duncan specifically for Beck in 1973 is predicted to sell for as much as £150,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Highlights from the guitar haul will be on public view in Los Angeles on December 4-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The full collection will go on show for a week at Christie's London headquarters before the January 22 sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie's Amelia Walker said the auctioneers were "honoured to have been entrusted" with the sale of instruments belonging to a "rock pioneer whose influence on his peers was unmatched."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added Beck's guitars had "shared his emotion and voice" with the world and the auction would "pay tribute to his enduring legacy." (AFP)

    Landslide win for Sri Lanka president's coalition

<img alt="Anura Kumara Dissanayake's leftist coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779382_1_20241115211555.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake thanked voters on Friday for delivering his leftist coalition a landslide victory in snap parliamentary elections that repudiated establishment parties blamed for triggering an economic crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake, a self-avowed Marxist, swept September presidential elections on a promise to combat graft and recover stolen assets, two years after a slow-motion financial crash imposed widespread hardships on the island nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  His decision to immediately call polls and secure parliamentary backing for his agenda was vindicated on Friday, with his National People's Power (NPP) coalition taking at least 159 seats in the 225-member assembly – exceeding a two-thirds majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to all who voted for a renaissance," Dissanayake said in a brief statement on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coalition had a monumental 61.5 percent of the vote while opposition leader Sajith Premadasa's party was well behind with only 17.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People voted to get rid of corruption and a corrupt system," said IT professional Chanaka Rajapaksha, who supported the NPP in the polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a sign of the magnitude of support for Dissanayake, his party won the most votes in the northern district of Jaffna, dominated by the island's minority Tamil community, for the first time since independence from Britain in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voter turnout was estimated at under 70 percent, less than the 80 percent of eligible voters who cast a ballot in September's presidential polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake, the 55-year-old son of a labourer, had been an MP for nearly 25 years and was briefly an agriculture minister but his NPP coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stormed to the presidency after successfully distancing himself from successive leaders blamed for steering the country to its 2022 economic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial crash was the worst in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka's history as an independent nation, sparking months-long shortages of food, fuel and essential medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The resulting public anger culminated in the storming of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's compound, prompting his resignation and temporary exile.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake's pledge to change a "corrupt" political culture has resonated with millions of Sri Lankans struggling to make ends meet following tax hikes and other austerity measures imposed to repair the nation's finances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very happy about this victory," said voter Nilusha Nilmini after the scale of the win became clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All this time, the country was governed by thieves, robbers and corrupt people. I am very happy that the crooks are out and a clean government has been established."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake's JVP party, the main constituent in the NPP coalition, led two insurrections in 1971 and 1987 that resulted in at least 80,000 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he was sworn in after presidential polls described as one of the island nation's most peaceful elections. (AFP)

<img alt="Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of this year's US presidential election and endorsed Donald Trump. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779324_1_20241115153158.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday that he had selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist who has spread misinformation on vaccines, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the top health agency in the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a post on X, Kennedy vowed to work to end chronic diseases, clean up corruption and provide Americans with the data they needed to make informed decisions, vowing to Trump that he would work to "Make America Healthy Again”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy ran for president in this year's election as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump, in exchange for a role in the Republican's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country," Trump said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appointment, which had been seen as a possibility for weeks, raised concern among some public health advocates who said Kennedy could have a negative role in Americans' health given his power over public health agencies. The Democratic Party decried the decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some politicians and business groups supported the nomination, such as the National Community Pharmacists Association, which said it was encouraged by his willingness to take on corporations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among Kennedy's suggestions is that he would gut the 18,000-employee Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – which ensures the safety of food, drugs and medical devices – and replace hundreds of employees at the National Institutes of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "FDA's war on public health is about to end," he wrote on X in late October, adding that includes its "aggressive suppression" of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, sunshine and other items.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1. Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of vaccine makers, including Pfizer and Moderna, fell after news of Kennedy's appointment and were down in after-hours trading by as much as two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy has been criticised for making false medical claims, including that vaccines are linked to autism. He opposed state and federal restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic and was accused of spreading misinformation about the virus.
  <br>
  <br>
  He disputes the anti-vaccine tag, saying he instead wants more rigorous testing of vaccines. However, he chaired the Children's Health Defense, a non-profit organisation that focuses on anti-vaccine messaging. (Reuters)

    President Xi inaugurates new Peru megaport

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday inaugurated Latin America's first Beijing-funded port in Chancay, Peru -- a symbol of China's growing influence on the continent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$3.5-billion complex, about 80 kilometres north of Lima, is meant to serve as a hub for Chinese trade as the country prepares for the threat of major tariff hikes once Donald Trump re-enters the White House for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The port was officially opened in a ceremony overseen virtually by Xi and Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte from Lima, where they will attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Friday and Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China plays a major role in the growth of our economy," Boluarte said at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi, for his part, said the port would help "promote connectivity" between South America and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are witnessing... the birth of a new land-sea channel between Asia and Latin America in the new era," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru -- one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies over the past decade -- is China's fourth-largest Latin American trading partner, with bilateral flows of nearly US$36 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States as they trade with Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay is the latest addition to infrastructure projects built under the Belt and Road Initiative to stimulate trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed Cosco Shipping Ports, which owns 60 percent of the port, has a 30-year concession to operate the terminal and has forecast it will handle up to a million containers in its first year of operation. (AFP)

    High security as Israel draw with France in Paris

<img alt="The Israeli team on the pitch after the match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779241_1_20241115080700.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel and France played out a goalless draw in a Nations League football match in Paris on Thursday surrounded by a huge security operation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 4,000 police and members of the security forces patrolled inside and outside the Stade de France to prevent a repetition of the attacks on fans of Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A further 1,600 civilian security personnel were also on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards had to intervene at one point to stop fans of both nations from clashing in the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos taken by spectators and posted on the X social media platform showed fans, some with Israeli flags, running along the rows of seats at the stadium while other supporters whistled and booed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the stadium security team moved between the two groups to separate them and the incident was over within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tension surrounding the fixture caused many fans to stay away with just 16,611 in a stadium that holds up to 80,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 Israeli fans attended the match despite calls from Israeli authorities to avoid the fixture. Around 600 members of the Jewish community in France travelled to the stadium in buses with a police escort.
  <br>
  <br>
  French authorities mounted a huge security operation after the government defied calls from some French lawmakers to postpone the match or move it to another city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not give in to anti-Semitism anywhere, and violence – including in the French Republic – will never prevail, nor will intimidation," President Emmanuel Macron, who attended the game, told BFMTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the game to assure him that French authorities had taken the necessary security measures for the match to pass off smoothly, the president's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An elite police unit guarded the Israeli team from the moment they arrived on French soil. Israel coach Ran Ben Simon said the security had been "extraordinary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to thank the security people for protecting us," he said in a post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incidents in the Netherlands took place with anti-Israeli sentiment and reported anti-Semitic acts across the world soaring as Israel wages wars against Iran-backed Islamist militants in Lebanon and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The violence in Amsterdam flared after Maccabi fans in the city for a match against Ajax set fire to a Palestinian flag and vandalised a taxi 24 hours earlier, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the match, Maccabi fans were chased by men on scooters and beaten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amsterdam's mayor Femke Halsema called it a "poisonous cocktail of anti-Semitism and hooliganism".
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutch far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders blamed the violence on "Muslims". (AFP)

    World's largest coral found near Solomon Islands

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing on Thursday a major discovery "pulsing with life and colour".
 <br>
  <br>
  The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they had stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and colour," marine ecologist Enric Sala said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The standalone structure had been growing for some 300 years, the researchers said, formed from a "complex network" of tiny coral polyps.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was distinct from a coral reef, which is made from many distinct coral colonies, they explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measuring 34 metres wide and 32 metres long, the team said the "mega coral" was three times bigger than the previous record holder – a coral dubbed "Big Momma" in American Samoa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor," said lead scientist Molly Timmers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was longer than a blue whale and was thought to be "so colossal" that it could "be seen from space".
  <br>
  <br>
  The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands in an area known as the Three Sisters.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope," said coral scientist Eric Brown. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has arrived in Lima, kicking off a week-long diplomatic visit of South America during which he will attend the Apec Leaders’ meeting and the G20 summit in Brazil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peru pulled out all the stops at the airport, rolling out the red carpet while soldiers performed a guard of honour as Xi’s chartered jet landed just after noon, Lima time.
  <br>
  <br>
  First to greet the Chinese leader was Gustavo Adrianzen, the Peruvian Prime minister who stood in for President Dina Boluarte while she was occupied by other Apec engagements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who arrived the previous night, also greeted Xi on the tarmac, alongside Beijing’s top diplomat in Peru, Song Yang.
  <br>
  <br>
  After shaking hands, Xi and Lee had a brief conversation as dozens of officials, bodyguards, and media representatives watched on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president then headed to Government Palace for a state reception by his counterpart Boluarte.
  <br>
  <br>
  On top of their agenda was the inauguration of the Chancay megaport, which is jointly funded and owned by Chinese shipping giant Cosco.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders were also expected to sign bilateral agreements covering trade and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will also meet US President Joe Biden during his time in Lima, before moving on to Rio de Janeiro next week for the G20 summit.

    India's toxic smog hides landmarks, delays flights

<img alt="Dense fog wreathed worshippers at the Golden Temple in Punjab. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779185_1_20241114203648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Toxic smog obscured India's famed monument to love, the Taj Mahal, as well as Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, becoming too thick to see through in several places.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city of Lahore in neighbouring Pakistan ranked as the world's most polluted in winter's annual scourge across the region, worsened by dust, emissions, and smoke from fires burnt illegally in India's farming states of Punjab and Haryana.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the city of Agra, the Taj Mahal was barely visible from the gardens in front of the 17th-century monument, while dense fog wreathed worshippers at the Golden Temple in Punjab, television images showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi flights also faced delays, with tracking website Flightradar24 showing 88 percent of departures and 54 percent of arrivals were delayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials blamed high pollution, combined with humidity, becalmed winds and a drop in temperature for the smog, which cut visibility to 300 metres at the city's international airport, which diverted flights in zero visibility on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  More patients flocked to hospitals, particularly children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There has been a sudden increase in children with allergies, cough and cold ... and a rise in acute asthma attacks," Sahab Ram, a paediatrician in Punjab's Fazilka region, told news agency ANI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi's minimum temperature fell to 16.1 degrees Celsius on Thursday from 17 degrees Celsius the previous day, weather officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its pollution ranked in the 'severe' category for the second consecutive day, with a score of 430 on an index of air quality maintained by the top pollution panel that rates a score of zero to 50 as 'good'.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pollution in New Delhi is likely to stay in the 'severe' category on Friday, the earth sciences ministry said, before improving to 'very poor', or an index score of 300 to 400.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of farm fires to clear fields in northern India has risen steadily this week to almost 2,300 on Wednesday from 1,200 on Monday, the ministry's website showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, was rated the world's most polluted city on Thursday, in live rankings kept by Swiss group IQAir. Authorities there have also battled hazardous air this month. (Reuters)

<img alt="Rescuers fetch residents during a forced evacuation operation in Buguey town, Cagayan province, north of Manila, ahead of Super Typhoon Usagi's landfall. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779129_1_20241114154252.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philippines raised its highest storm alert and evacuated thousands of people on Thursday, as Super Typhoon Usagi barrelled towards its already disaster-ravaged north.
 <br>
  <br>
  Packing sustained winds of up to 185 kilometres an hour, Usagi is set to hit the main island of Luzon later on Thurday -- the fifth storm to threaten the country in just three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The brutal wave of weather disturbances has already killed 159 people and prompted the United Nations to request US$32.9 million in aid for the worst-affected regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national weather agency said the winds could cause "almost total damage to structures of light materials, especially in highly exposed coastal areas", and "heavy damage" to buildings otherwise considered "low-risk".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense to torrential rain" and potentially "life-threatening" coastal waves of up to three metres were also forecast over two days, with the storm warning raised to the highest signal on a five-step scale.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Cagayan province, where the storm is expected to make landfall, officials worked in driving rain to remove residents along the coasts and on the banks of already swollen rivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday it was preemptive evacuations. Now we're doing forced evacuations," local disaster official Edward Gaspar said, adding 1,404 residents were sheltering at a municipal gym.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many more evacuees in nearby villages but we haven't had time to visit and count them," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cagayan's civil defence chief Rueli Rapsing said he expects local governments to take 40,000 people to shelters, roughly the same number that were preemptively evacuated ahead of Typhoon Yinxing, which struck Cagayan's north coast earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 5,000 Cagayan residents were still in shelters following the previous storms because the Cagayan River, the country's largest, remained swollen from heavy rain that fell in several provinces upstream.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Usagi, Tropical Storm Man-yi is also forecast to strike the Philippines' population heartland around the capital Manila this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Typhoons are overlapping. As soon as communities attempt to recover from the shock, the next tropical storm is already hitting them again," UN Philippines Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Gustavo Gonzalez said.

  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people and keeping millions in enduring poverty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A recent study showed that storms in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Several airlines resumed flights to Bali on Thursday, after cancelling trips to and from the Indonesian resort island due to huge eruptions at a nearby volcano.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eighty-three international routes were cancelled on Wednesday, the general manager of Bali's international airport said in a statement, after Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki spewed a nine-kilometre tower of ash into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcano has erupted more than a dozen times over the last two weeks, killing at least nine people and forcing the evacuation of thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qantas and Jetstar resumed their services to Bali, Australia's Qantas Group said in a statement on Thursday, noting "improved" conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to monitor the changing conditions and volcanic activity," it said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of Thursday morning, Bali's airport had recorded another 32 international flight cancellations while 180 international flights were scheduled, the airport's general manager Ahmad Syaugi Shahab said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that volcanic ash from Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki had been heading away from the airport since Wednesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope affected airline passengers can resume their travel on Thursday," Ahmad said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewotobi erupted again overnight into Thursday morning, and a thick ash column and lava flows could be seen pouring from its crater, according to authorities. (AFP)

    Harvey wins Booker Prize for space story 'Orbital'

<img alt='"Orbital" tracks astronauts from five countries as they observe and reflect on their home planet, touching on themes of mourning, desire and the climate crisis. Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778941_1_20241113213850.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Samantha Harvey won the 2024 Booker Prize for her novel 'Orbital', a story about a single day aboard the International Space Station that ponders the beauty and fragility of Earth.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Orbital" tracks astronauts from Japan, Russia, the United States, Britain and Italy as they observe and reflect on their home planet, touching on themes of mourning, desire and the climate crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the 49-year-old Harvey's fifth novel, and was the top selling book on the shortlist of six finalists, having sold more copies than the past three Booker Prize winners combined.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judges of the prize, which is now in its 55th year, praised her writing for the "intensity of attention to the precious and precarious world".
  <br>
  <br>
  Past winners of the prestigious Booker, which is open to works of fiction written in English, include Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie, Yann Martel, Hilary Mantel, Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes and Kazuo Ishiguro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvey said she wrote the novel while stuck at home during the pandemic watching the space station's live camera. She likened the experience of her six characters "trapped in a tin can" to that of lockdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Set over 24 hours, the astronauts and cosmonauts of her story witness sixteen sunrises and sixteen sunsets as they circle the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  “To look at the Earth from space is like a child looking into a mirror and realizing for the first time that the person in the mirror is herself," said Harvey. "What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the novel “is not exactly about climate change, but implied in the view of the Earth is the fact of human-made climate change”.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her acceptance speech, Harvey dedicated the prize to "everybody who does speak for and not against the Earth; for and not against the dignity of other humans, other life; and all the humans who speak for and call for and work for peace".
  <br>
  <br>
  Writer and artist Edmund de Waal, who chaired the five-member judging panel, praised the “crystalline” writing and “capaciousness” of Harvey’s succinct novel - at 136 pages in its UK paperback edition, one of the shortest-ever Booker winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is a book that repays slow reading,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the judges spent a full day picking their winner and came to a unanimous conclusion. Harvey beat five other finalists from Canada, the United States, Australia and the Netherlands, chosen from among 156 novels submitted by publishers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvey walks away with a 50,000 pound prize which she said she would disburse “some of it on tax. I want to buy a new bike. And then the rest, I want to go to Japan”. (Agencies)

    China hawk Rubio gets Trump nod for secretary of state

<img alt="Marco Rubio, Trump's pick as secretary of state, has been sanctioned twice by China. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779000_1_20241114045203.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has announced that he is nominating Republican Senator and noted China hawk Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, as he quickly fills out his cabinet ahead of his January 20 inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who clashed bitterly with Rubio for the presidential nomination in 2016, said in a statement nominating him: "Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said in a statement that he will work with Trump "every day to carry out his foreign policy agenda."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the leadership of President Trump, we will deliver peace through strength and always put the interests of Americans and America above all else," Rubio said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants to Miami and vociferous opponent of Latin American communists, China and Iran, would be the first Hispanic as the top US diplomat.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 to sanction SAR and central government officials, and has in turn been sanctioned by Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio was among a flurry of new nominations announced by Trump. He also tabbed Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, and former Democratic representative Tulsi Gabbard as his director of national intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength," Trump said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also extolled Gaetz, a staunch ally who has defended Trump in his legal battles and impeachment fights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System," Trump posted on social media. "Matt will end Weaponized Government... and restore Americans' badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department."
  <br>
  <br>
  As attorney general, Gaetz would drive all aspects of the work of the US Justice Department, which for years has carried out an investigation into sex trafficking and obstruction of justice allegations involving him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaetz, who denies all wrongdoing, was told last year that there would be no charges against him, but he remains the subject of a House ethics investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican and Democratic senators immediately voiced doubts that Gaetz's nomination would survive the confirmation process, which can involve intense questioning during difficult, fraught hearings. (Agencies)

    Republicans complete takeover with House majority

<img alt="CNN and NBC projected that the Republicans have retained their majority in the House of Representatives. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778993_1_20241114040243.jpg&q=25">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Republican Party has won a majority in the US House of Representatives, American media projected on Wednesday, completing their clean sweep of Congress and handing President-elect Donald Trump vast legislative power.
 <br>
  <br>
  After more than a week of vote counting, CNN and NBC projected that the Republicans had reached the 218 seats needed to retain their majority in the 435-seat lower chamber, having already secured control over the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a beautiful morning in Washington. It is a new day in America," said House Speaker Mike Johnson, who held a press conference to celebrate victory before the result was official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sun is shining, and that's a reflection about how we all feel. This is a very, very important moment for the country and we do not take it lightly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump triumphed in each of the seven battleground states in the November 5 presidential election and also won the national popular vote, with preliminary figures showing him ahead of Democratic Party challenger Kamala Harris by 3.2 million votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having control of both chambers of Congress will clear the way for him to confirm his nominations for key positions in his administration and will also allow him to push through his radical agenda of mass deportations, tax cuts and slashing regulations.

    Xi to hold final talks with Biden in Peru: US official

<img alt="Saturday's talks between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden in Peru is expected to the last between the world leaders. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778981_1_20241114021104.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping will reportedly be holding talks with his US counterpart Joe Biden on Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Peru, in what’s expected to be their last official talks before Donald Trump takes office.
 <br>
  <br>
  A senior Biden administration official briefed reporters about the meeting on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect this will be their last meeting as presidents," the official said. "With that in mind, we expect the president will use the opportunity to take stock of efforts to responsibly manage competition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has already signaled a confrontational approach with Beijing for his second term, picking a number of outspoken China hawks for key foreign and defense positions in his top team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has also promised to slap 60-percent tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to fears of a renewed trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Biden administration official would not be drawn on whether he would try to advise China on how to deal with Trump – or if he would advise Trump on how to deal with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a difficult, complicated, consequential relationship," the official said. "The president has been pretty clear that he even admits the competitive aspects of the relationship, we need to find ways to manage it responsibly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden heads to Lima on Thursday for the APEC summit on Friday and Saturday for his swansong at the major gathering of Asia-Pacific economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been working for months to arrange a final meeting between Xi and Biden before the Democrat leaves office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's talks will be the third meeting between Biden and Xi during Biden's presidency. They met in Woodside, California, last November on the sidelines of the 2023 Apec summit, and the leaders last spoke by phone in April. (Agencies)

    Republicans pick John Thune as new US Senate leader

<img alt="Republican senators picked John Thune as their new leader, over Texas Senator John Cornyn and Florida's Rick Scott. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778975_1_20241114012608.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Senate Republicans elected John Thune to lead the chamber next year, opting for a well-regarded insider and shrugging off a public pressure campaign by supporters of Donald Trump to pick a loyalist to the president-elect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The South Dakota senator's victory in a three-way contest is a sign the Senate could retain some degree of independence from Trump next year, when Republicans will control the White House and possibly both chambers of Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans will hold at least 52 seats in the 100-seat Senate and are on track to retain their majority in the House of Representatives, where several races have yet to be decided.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thune, 63, is seen as an even-tempered institutionalist and seasoned legislator who has close relationships with many of his fellow Republicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  He currently serves as the chamber's No. 2 Republican and will succeed 82-year-old Mitch McConnell, the longest serving party leader in Senate history. He was first elected to the Senate in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thune prevailed over Senator John Cornyn of Texas, another long-serving institutionalist, and Rick Scott of Florida, a close ally of Trump who was backed by influential outsiders like billionaire Elon Musk and conservative commentator Sean Hannity.
  <br>
  <br>
  That made the normally clubby election an early test of Senate independence under Trump, who has not endorsed a candidate but called on the next Republican leader to give him leeway to bypass the normal system of hearings and votes to approve Cabinet nominees.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three contenders quickly signaled their openness to the idea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of Trump's loudest supporters had expressed concern that Thune and Cornyn, who had both worked closely with McConnell, might lack the willingness to deliver on some of Trump's campaign promises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both have served for two decades and delivered major legislation and helped elected other Republicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott, first elected in 2018, is a hardline conservative who previously served two terms as Florida governor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without Rick Scott, the entire Trump reform agenda wobbly," Trump adviser Robert F Kennedy Jr. said in a post on X before the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senate Republicans resisted that pressure. The job of majority leader, they said, requires someone who has spent time building trust and support within the caucus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think it's worth the president using the political capital that he has to weigh in on the race," said Senator Markwayne Mullin, a Thune supporter. (Reuters)

    Smooth transfer vowed as Trump returns to White House

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump thanked President Joe Biden for pledging a smooth transfer of power as the victorious Republican made a historic return visit to the White House on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Politics is tough, and in many cases it's not a very nice world. It is a nice world today and I appreciate it very much," Trump said after the two men shook hands in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, added that the transition would be "smooth as you can get."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden greeted Trump in front of a roaring fire, offering him congratulations and saying: "Welcome back."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 81-year-old Biden invited his sworn rival to the White House –despite the fact that Trump, who refused to admit his 2020 election loss, never afforded Biden the same courtesy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden, who dropped out of the election in July but saw his successor Kamala Harris lose to Trump last week, said he was "looking forward to having a smooth transition."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, (have) what you need," he told Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the White House visit, Trump addressed Republicans from the House of Representatives at a Washington hotel near the Capitol, which a mob of his supporters stormed in 2021 to try to reverse his election loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ebullient Trump suggested that he could even be open to a third term in office – which would violate the US constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I suspect I won't be running again unless you say, 'He's good, we got to figure something else,'" he said, drawing some laughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's party looks set to take both chambers of Congress and consolidate his extraordinary comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was accompanied at the meeting with Republicans by the world's richest man Elon Musk, whom he named on Tuesday as head of a new group aimed at slashing government spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has launched a flurry of nominations as he moves swiftly to name his administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest announcement, Trump said he would be bringing four advisers from his presidential campaign into his new White House as deputy chiefs of staff, including two longtime aides and the political director who played a key role in his victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incoming president said longtime aide Dan Scavino will serve as a deputy without giving a specific portfolio, campaign political director James Blair as deputy for legislative, political and public affairs, and Taylor Budowich as deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  All will have the rank of assistant to the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also formally announced Stephen Miller, an immigration hard-liner, will be deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser. That had previously been confirmed by Vice President-elect JD Vance on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blair was the political director for Trump’s campaign and, once Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee, the political director for the Republican National Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scavino was a senior adviser on Trump’s campaign and, in his first term in the White House, he worked as a social media director.
  <br>
  <br>
  He began working for Trump as a caddy at one of Trump’s golf courses, and was part of the small group of staffers who traveled with the president across the country for the entirety of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before joining the campaign, Budowich worked for the pro-Trump Super PAC, Maga Inc., and after Trump left office, Budowich served as his spokesman while working for Trump's political action committee, Save America.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Dan, Stephen, James, and Taylor were ‘best in class’ advisors on my winning campaign, and I know they will honorably serve the American people in the White House,” Trump said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They will continue to work hard to Make America Great Again in their respective new roles.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Miller is one of Trump’s longest-serving aides, dating back to his first campaign for the White House. He was a senior adviser in Trump’s first term and has been a central figure in many of his policy decisions, particularly on immigration, including Trump’s move to separate thousands of immigrant families as a deterrence program in 2018.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping headed to Peru on Wednesday, bound for a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) organisation leaders overshadowed by fears of renewed global trade tensions under US President-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi will join leaders from the United States and other Asia-Pacific nations in the Peruvian capital Lima for the Apec gathering, after which he will go to Brazil for a G20 summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  While in Peru, Xi will also inaugurate South America's first Chinese-funded port, in Chancay, around 80 kilometres north of Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia and Ecuador, among other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States for trade with Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting on Wednesday, Lima will receive government ministers and business leaders of Apec member countries, which also include Russia, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Chile and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ministerial meetings will take place on Thursday, followed by talks at the level of heads of state the following two days. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the world's richest man, Elon Musk, will lead a new government efficiency group tasked with cutting federal waste, as the Republican added a series of seasoned figures and hardliners to his incoming administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk became a key ally to Trump during his campaign, reportedly spending over US$100 million to help the former president and repeatedly boosting Trump's candidacy on X, the social media platform he owns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Musk and another stalwart ally, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, would lead a "Department of Government Efficiency ('DOGE')" a tongue-in-cheek reference to an internet meme and cryptocurrency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies," Trump said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the department "will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government," a move that could allow Musk to avoid disclosing his financial holdings.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on X, Musk said the department's actions will be published online "for maximum transparency" and will include a "leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining," Musk wrote. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping's special representative at the United Nations climate summit has called for a strengthening of early warning systems and enhancing climate adaptation capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang was addressing a high-level meeting held by China on Tuesday, during COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, said China attached great importance to international cooperation on meteorological early warnings and that President Xi had made specific requirements on this issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, Ding proposed three points, including standardising climate risk assessments, building a global early warning network by sharing technology and enhancing interconnectivity, and establishing a climate adaptation partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said China would develop a South-South cooperation flagship project for early warning in response to climate change, and support developing countries with meteorological observation equipment, early warning systems, and training.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere at the summit, scientists said global carbon dioxide emissions, including those from burning fossil fuels, would hit a record high this year, pulling the world further off course from averting more destructive climate extremes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Global Carbon Budget report, published during the climate summit, said global CO2 emissions are set to total 41.6 billion metric tons in 2024, up from 40.6 billion tons last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report forecast that emissions in China would marginally increase by 0.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report's authors said China's emissions from oil use have likely peaked, as electric vehicles gain market share. (Agencies)

    Judge delays ruling in Trump's hush money case

<img alt="Donald Trump was found guilty in May of of falsifying business records to conceal money paid to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778799_2_20241113102116.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge has postponed a decision on whether to undo US President-elect Donald Trump’s hush money conviction as prosecutors consider how to proceed in light of last week’s election and his lawyers argue for dismissal so he can run the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump is due to be sentenced in New York this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of Justice has already dropped two outstanding criminal investigations into the former president, one relating to his alleged efforts to subvert the outcome of the last election and the other regarding his alleged mishandling of classified documents.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the criminal case in New York, where Trump has already been convicted of fraud in connection with the payments made to Stormy Daniels, is outside the purview of the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  New York commuters on Tuesday morning were split over whether sentencing in the case should be scrapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think anybody should be above the law. I mean, I don’t care who you are," one man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another male commuter disagreed, saying, “the financial crime case is a joke. Regardless of who the President is, they need to have some immunity to do their jobs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was not in office when he made the payments to Stormy Daniels. But his lawyers are arguing that because he is poised to return to the Oval Office, any sentencing in the case could create an impediment to his ability to carry out his duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes as the US Senate's Democratic majority moves to confirm as many new federal judges nominated by President Biden as possible to avoid leaving vacancies that Trump could fill after taking office on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Republicans set to take control of the chamber on January 3, the Senate on Tuesday voted in favour of former prosecutor April Perry becoming a district court judge in Illinois.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has announced another 30 judicial nominees who are awaiting Senate confirmation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump made 234 judicial appointments during his first four years in office, the second most of any president in a single term, and moved the judiciary rightward - including building a 6-3 conservative majority on the US Supreme Court with three appointees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has appointed a host of liberal judges, including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. (Agencies)

    Researchers: Bright lights could deter shark attacks

<img alt="The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted in the waters of South Africa's Mossel Bay, a popular great white feeding ground.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released on Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biologist Laura Ryan said the predator often attacked its prey from underneath, occasionally mistaking a surfer's silhouette for the outline of a seal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan and her fellow researchers showed that seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks.
  <br>
  <br>
  This appeared to be because the lights distorted the silhouette on the ocean's surface, making it appear less appetising.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is this longstanding fear of white sharks and part of that fear is that we don't understand them that well," said Ryan, from Australia's Macquarie University.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted in the waters of South Africa's Mossel Bay, a popular great white feeding ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seal-shaped decoys were strung with different configurations of LED lights and towed behind a boat to see which attracted the most attention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighter lights were better at deterring sharks, the research found, while vertical lights were less effective than horizontal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan said the results were better than expected and is now in the process of building prototypes for use on the underside of kayaks and surfboards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia has some of the world's most comprehensive shark management measures, including monitoring drones, shark nets and a tagging system that alerts authorities when a shark is near a crowded beach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan said her research could allow less invasive mitigation methods to be used.
  <br>
  <br>
  More research was needed to see if bull and tiger sharks - which have different predatory behaviour - responded to the lights in a similar way, the authors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been more than 1,200 shark incidents in Australia since 1791, of which 255 resulted in death, official data shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Great white sharks were responsible for 94 of those deaths. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The leader of the world's Anglican communion, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, announced on Tuesday he was resigning following a damning report that concluded the Church of England covered up a serial abuse case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Welby had faced days of growing pressure to quit after the independent probe found Welby "could and should" have formally reported decades of abuse by a Church-linked lawyer to authorities in 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  A petition demanding his resignation, launched in the wake of the report's revelations, has garnered nearly 14,000 signatures while leading clergy, including some bishops, were increasingly urging him to quit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and re-traumatising period between 2013 and 2024," Welby said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope this decision makes clear how seriously the Church of England understands the need for change and our profound commitment to creating a safer church.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As I step down I do so in sorrow with all victims and survivors of abuse."
  <br>
  <br>
  The independent Makin Review concluded that John Smyth, a lawyer who organised evangelical summer camps in the 1970s and 1980s, was responsible for "prolific, brutal and horrific" abuse of as many as 130 boys and young men.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found the Church of England - the mother church of Anglicanism - covered up the "traumatic physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual attacks", which occurred in Britain, Zimbabwe and South Africa over several decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smyth, who lived in Africa from 1984, died aged 75 in South Africa in 2018 while under investigation by British police. He never faced any criminal charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appointed the Church of England's highest-ranking cleric in 2013, Welby has apologised for what occurred but previously insisted he would not resign because he did not know about the wrongdoing before then. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, The New York Times reported on Monday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  It quoted three people as saying that the decision is not final, but that Trump appears to have settled on Rubio, a loyalist whom Trump passed over as his vice presidential running mate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has moved quickly to staff his incoming administration, naming loyalists to several key posts within days of his election victory and signalling his desire to have some seated without a Senate confirmation process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The staffing picks are the subject of intense speculation and scrutiny, with Trump vowing that his second administration will oversee a radical shake-up of the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 78-year-old Republican tycoon said Sunday he would tap hardline immigration official Tom Homan as the country's "border czar," while US media reported the nod for UN ambassador as going to New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a vocal Trump ally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Miller, another fierce critic of illegal immigration who served in Trump's first administration, has been tapped for deputy chief of staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The picks signal movement on a number of Trump's key campaign messages, with Homan's hardline immigration stance making him a loyal hand in carrying out the incoming president's deportation promises.

  <br>
  Stefanik, who has voiced strong support for Israel, will represent the administration as the UN grapples with the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik's nomination would need approval by the Senate, but Trump is hoping to bypass Congress by making appointments while the chamber is in recess.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another hardliner, Florida congressman Michael Waltz, is reportedly in line to take the crucial National Security Advisor role, according to The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump will not be inaugurated until January, and had previously made one cabinet-level appointment, naming his campaign manager Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, a position that does not require Senate confirmation. (AFP)

    Japan's re-elected PM Ishiba vows to step up reform

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged to take tougher measures against misuse of political funds after he was re-elected by parliament on Monday following a major loss in the polls last month by his governing coalition.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba’s Liberal Democratic Party and its junior partner Komeito together lost a majority in the 465-seat Lower House, the more powerful of Japan’s two-house parliament, in the October 27 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was blamed on voter outrage over financial misconduct by his party.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must remind ourselves of the basics that politics is for the people, as we tackle political and party reforms," Ishiba said. He said that in response to the poor election results, "We must be able to have empathy for the pain, sorrow and anger of the people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A special parliamentary session convened on Monday to pick a new leader in a vote required within 30 days of a general election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba beat top opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda 221-160 in the first runoff in 30 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his second Cabinet in just over a month, Ishiba reappointed most of its previous members, including Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi.
  <br>
  <br>
  He replaced three ministers who lost seats or were affected by the election results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba stressed the importance of pursuing the significant buildup of Japan's defence power.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he plans to attend Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits later this month to strengthen partnership with the Global South nations and the Asia-Pacific region. He said he will hold talks with US President Joe Biden, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and other leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  His government is also reportedly arranging a possible meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. (AP)

 Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler on Monday called on Israel to respect Iran's sovereignty and refrain from attacking Iranian soil, highlighting warming ties between the Middle East rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told a summit of Arab and Muslim leaders that the international community should oblige Israel "to respect the sovereignty of the sisterly Islamic Republic of Iran and not to violate its lands".
  <br>
  <br>
  Opening the summit, he said the international community must "immediately halt the Israeli actions against our brothers in Palestine and Lebanon", condemning Israel's campaign in Gaza as "genocide".
  <br>
  <br>
  "(Saudi Arabia) affirms its support for the brothers in Palestine and Lebanon to overcome the disastrous humanitarian consequences of the ongoing Israeli aggression," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A draft resolution for the summit stresses "firm support" for "national rights" for the Palestinian people, "foremost among which is their right to freedom and to an independent, sovereign state".
  <br>
  <br>
  Just hours earlier, newly appointed Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said it was not "realistic" to establish a Palestinian state, dismissing it as a "Hamas state".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think this position is realistic today and we must be realistic," Saar said in response to a question during an appearance in Jerusalem.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi foreign ministry announced plans for the summit in late October during a meeting, also in Riyadh, of a new "international alliance" to press for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes one year after a similar gathering in Riyadh of the Cairo-based Arab League and the Jeddah-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation during which leaders condemned Israeli forces' actions in Gaza as "barbaric". (AFP)

    UN climate talks off to rocky start

<img alt="COP29 president Mukhtar Babayev addresses the opening of the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Azerbaijan. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778581_1_20241111212523.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The COP29 talks opened on Monday with calls for global cooperation and fresh warnings about climate disasters, but proceedings quickly ground to a halt in a fight over the agenda.
 <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump's re-election is already hanging over the talks in Baku where negotiators are meant to agree new funding for climate action in poorer countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they opened, UN climate chief Simon Stiell told countries: "Now is the time to show that global cooperation is not down for the count."
  <br>
  <br>
  And he warned rich countries struggling to agree a new funding target to "dispense with any idea that climate finance is charity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "An ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every nation, including the largest and wealthiest."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the official proceedings in the capital of oil- and gas-rich Azerbaijan stalled almost immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're not going to resume until they resolve... the agenda," said Alden Meyer, senior associate at climate change think tank E3G.
  <br>
  <br>
  The COP29 president "can't put negotiating teams to work" until they adopt it, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators must increase a US$100 billion-a-year target to help developing nations prepare for worsening climate impacts and wean their economies off fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  How much will be on offer, who will pay, and who can access the funds are some of the major points of contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries are pushing for trillions of dollars and insist money should be mostly grants rather than loans, but negotiators are tight-lipped over what final figure might emerge.
  <br>
  <br>
  COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev acknowledged the need was "in the trillions" but said a more "realistic goal" was somewhere in the hundreds of billions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These negotiations are complex and difficult," the former executive of Azerbaijan's national oil company said at the opening of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries warn that without adequate finance, they will struggle to offer ambitious updates to their climate goals, which countries are required to submit by early next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global North owes the global South a climate debt," said Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not leave this COP if the ambition level on the finance... doesn't match the scale at which finance must be delivered."
  <br>
  <br>
  The small group of developed countries that currently contributes the money wants the donor pool expanded to include other rich nations and top emitters, including China and the Gulf states.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is firmly rejected by Beijing, with one Chinese official warning on Sunday during a closed-door session that the talks should not aim to "re-negotiate" existing agreements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just a handful of leaders from the Group of 20, whose countries account for nearly 80 percent of global emissions, are attending. US President Joe Biden is staying away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan will however be sending a delegation for the first time since the Taliban took power. They are expected to have observer status.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diplomats have insisted that the absences, and Trump's win, will not detract from the serious work at hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks come with fresh warnings that the world is far off track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN said Monday that 2024 is on track to break new temperature records, and the Paris climate agreement's goals were now "in great peril".
  <br>
  <br>
  The period from 2015 to 2024 will also be the warmest decade ever recorded, the UN's World Meteorological Organization said in a new report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The climate deal commits to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, preferably below 1.5C.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the world tops that level this year, it would not be an immediate breach of the Paris deal, which measures temperatures over decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it suggests much greater climate action is needed. (AFP)

    Parliament re-elects Ishiba as Japan PM in runoff vote

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese lawmakers voted on Monday for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to stay on as leader, after his scandal-tarnished coalition lost its parliamentary majority in a lower house election last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba, who called the snap poll after taking office on October 1, must now run a fragile minority government.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Liberal Democratic Party and coalition partner Komeito won the biggest bloc of seats in the election but lost the majority held since 2012, leaving him beholden to small opposition parties to pass his policy agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Underlining that fragility, Monday's vote in parliament, broadcast on television, went to a runoff for the first time in 30 years, with no candidate able to muster majority support in the first round.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ishiba eventually prevailed as expected, garnering 221 votes, well clear of his nearest challenger, ex-PM Yoshihiko Noda, the head of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, but still short of a majority in the 465-seat lower house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan will hold elections next year for the less powerful upper house, where the ruling coalition's slim majority could also be at risk if Ishiba cannot revive public trust roiled by a scandal over unrecorded donations to lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  His imminent challenge is compiling a supplementary budget for the fiscal year through March, under pressure from voters and opposition parties to raise spending on welfare and take steps to offset rising prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  For approval he needs the backing of at least one opposition party, which is most likely to be the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) headed by Yuichiro Tamaki.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has held co-operation talks with Ishiba, but DPP lawmakers on Friday did not vote for Ishiba to stay on as prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tamaki is also in a precarious position after admitting on Monday to an extramarital affair revealed in a tabloid magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  With his premiership confirmed, Ishiba now has to prepare for a slate of international engagements, including a summit of the Group of 20 big economies in Brazil on November 18 and 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also trying to arrange a stopover in the United States on the way to or from that gathering to meet Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some Japanese officials fear Trump might again hit Tokyo with protectionist trade measures and revive demands for it to pay more for the cost of stationing US forces there.
  <br>
  <br>
  These issues were largely smoothed over in Trump's first term, from 2017 to 2021, by the close ties between the president and Japan's then-premier, Shinzo Abe, a bond Ishiba seems keen to re-establish. (Reuters)

    Russia, Ukraine exchange massive drone attacks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A massive drone strike rattled Moscow and its suburbs overnight into Sunday, injuring a woman and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia's busiest airports, while a huge nighttime wave of Russian drones targeted Ukraine, officials reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  A top UK defence official meanwhile said that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since their full-scale assault on Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief of the UK defence staff, Tony Radakin, said Moscow’s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded “every single day,” bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's defence ministry said a total of 70 drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, including 34 over Moscow's outskirts. Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman in her 50s suffered burns to her face, neck and hands after drones sparked a blaze in her village southeast of Moscow, local Governor Andrei Vorobyov reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt in Moscow itself, according to Sobyanin, although Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying “an extraordinary price" for the war, even as a gruelling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine's industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how UK officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the losses were for “tiny increments of land,” and that Moscow's mounting defence and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Radakin insisted that Ukraine's Western partners should stand by it for “as long as it takes” to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of US President-elect Donald Trump have signalled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following “human wave” attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Russia overnight launched a “record” 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine’s air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were “lost”, the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa, local Governor Oleh Kiper reported. (AP)

    Dozens dead in Israeli strikes on Gaza, Lebanon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched deadly strikes on Gaza and Lebanon on Sunday, rescuers and authorities said, ahead of a US deadline for improved aid delivery to the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers in Gaza on Sunday said 30 people, including 13 children, were killed by Israeli strikes in the territory's north.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first strike early on Sunday hit a house in Jabalia, killing "at least 25" people including 13 children and injuring more than 30, the Palestinian territory's civil defence agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vowing to stop Hamas militants from regrouping in north Gaza, Israel on October 6 began a major air and ground assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations has described the area as under "siege" and Washington set a deadline of this coming week for Israel to get more aid in or face possible cuts to military assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strike on the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City killed five people, with others still missing, the civil defence agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A number of civilians are still under the rubble," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said it was "looking into the reports" of the strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon's health ministry, meanwhile, said an Israeli strike on the village of Almat north of Beirut killed at least 20 people including three children on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war in Gaza erupted with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,603 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which the UN considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since late September Israel has been engaged in a two-front war after turning its focus north toward Lebanon, escalating air strikes and sending in ground troops, after almost a year of tit-for-tat exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah. The Lebanese group said it was acting in support of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's main military backer the United States on October 15 warned that it could withhold some of its billions of dollars in military assistance unless Israel improves aid delivery to the Gaza Strip within 30 days – a deadline that expires on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at the time that top US officials made "clear to the government of Israel that there are changes that they need to make again to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up from the very, very low levels that it is at today."
  <br>
  <br>
  The demand came before Tuesday's election of President-elect Donald Trump who has promised to give freer rein to Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday a UN-backed assessment warned famine is imminent in northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid shipments allowed to enter Gaza were now lower than at any time since October 2023, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alert from the Famine Review Committee warned of "an imminent and substantial likelihood of famine occurring, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military questioned the report's credibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To date, all assessments by the IPC have proven incorrect and inconsistent with the situation on the ground," a military statement said, denouncing "partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests."
  <br>
  <br>
  IPC says its process is "evidence-based" and ensures "a rigorous, neutral analysis."
  <br>
  <br>
  The heads of UN agencies in early November described north Gaza as "under siege" and denied "basic aid and life-saving supplies."
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken hopes to use the remaining weeks of his term to press for an end to the Gaza and Lebanon wars, a spokesman said on Thursday, before fellow mediator Qatar on Saturday said it had suspended its role in trying to broker a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Qatar would resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness," Doha's foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said in a statement. (AFP)

    King Charles leads silence for UK war dead

<div class="itemFullText">
 King Charles led Britain in two minutes of silence on Sunday to honour the country's war dead at a remembrance service also attended by Catherine, Princess of Wales, as she returns to royal duties after cancer treatment.
 <br>
  <br>
  The king, who was also diagnosed with cancer this year, was among the dignitaries to lay wreaths at the Cenotaph memorial in central London after the nation fell silent at 11:00 am (1100 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds lined the Whitehall area of the capital as political leaders including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, current and former members of the armed forces, and war veterans paid their respects to Britons killed in the world wars and other conflicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Catherine, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, watched the ceremony from a government building balcony as she stepped up her return to royal duties since ending chemotherapy in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event came after she smiled and clapped alongside her husband Prince William at the Festival of Remembrance commemorative concert on Saturday night, the first major royal occasion she had attended since her treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The events, two of the most important dates in the royal calendar, marked the first time the princess had carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buckingham Palace announced in February that Charles, 75, had been diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer and would withdraw from public life to undergo treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The following month Kate, 42, revealed that she also had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both have since made limited returns to public duties, with Charles recently pausing his treatment while on tour in Australia and Samoa.
  <br>
  <br>
  William said this week that the past year had been "brutal" and probably the "hardest" of his life because of the twin diagnoses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, it's been dreadful," he told reporters on Thursday at the end of a four-day visit to South Africa for his Earthshot prize initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult."
  <br>
  <br>

    Philippines to evacuate 2,500 villages ahead of Toraji

<img alt="Severe Tropical Storm Toraji is set to batter parts of the Philippines still reeling from the devastation caused by three huge storms in less than a month. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778429_1_20241110194929.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The residents of 2,500 villages were ordered to evacuate their homes as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji approached the northern Philippines, the government said on Sunday, after three massive cyclones battered the country in less than a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 700,000 people are still sheltering at evacuation centres or with relatives after their homes were destroyed by tropical cyclones Trami, Kong-rey and Yinxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous trio of storms killed 159 people and with Toraji due to make landfall on Monday, people living in 2,500 villages across the northern regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley and Cordillera have been ordered to evacuate, Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The soil in those areas is now very saturated and the risk of landslides is very high," Remulla said in a briefing on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot stress it enough, the evacuation orders are important."
  <br>
  <br>
  Toraji, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 110 kilometres per hour, was expected to unleash torrential rains and strong winds when it makes landfall over the northern provinces of Aurora or Isabela, the state weather agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military and police have also prepositioned at least 14 aircraft for rescue and transportation of food in areas that could be isolated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sea travel has also been suspended and dams have started to release water in advance to prevent flooding, Remulla said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toraji's approach has complicated recovery efforts from the three previous storms.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Typhoon Yinxing slammed into the country's north coast. It left a 12-year-old girl dead and damaged houses and buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 51,000 people are still displaced in badly-hit Cagayan province north of Manila, with at least seven of its towns still without power, the provincial disaster agency said in a report on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks before that, Severe Tropical Storm Trami and Super Typhoon Kong-rey together left 158 people dead, the national disaster agency said, with most of that tally attributed to Trami.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has won the presidential election in Arizona, Edison Research projected on Saturday, completing a sweep of all seven battleground states and locking in a decisive Electoral College victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
 <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump, who had secured the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House by early on Wednesday, now has what is expected to be a final total of 312 votes to Harris' 226.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to Arizona, Trump won the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada. In 2020, Biden defeated Trump by winning six of the seven swing states - and narrowly lost North Carolina, winning 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also won 306 in his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump won 74.6 million votes nationwide, or 50.5 percent, to Harris' 70.9 million, or 48 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Congress certifies the Electoral College vote on January 6, Trump and his incoming vice president, US Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on January 20. (AP)

    Famine looming in north Gaza: UN-backed report

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Famine is looming in the northern Gaza Strip amid increased hostilities and a near-halt in food aid, a UN-backed assessment said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The alert from the Famine Review Committee warned of "an imminent and substantial likelihood of famine occurring, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Famine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future," said the alert.
  <br>
  <br>
  On October 17, the body projected that the number of people in Gaza facing "catastrophic" food insecurity between November and April 2025 would reach 345,000, or 16 percent of the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report classified that as IPC Phase 5 – a situation when "starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels are evident."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since that report, conditions have worsened in the north of Gaza, with a collapse of food systems, a drop in humanitarian aid and critical water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, the committee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It can therefore be assumed that starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing in these areas," it read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vast areas of the Gaza Strip have been devastated by Israel's retaliatory assault launched after the October 7 attack last year by Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces have intensified their operations in large swathes of the Gaza Strip's north since early October, where evacuation orders are in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid shipments allowed to enter the Gaza Strip were now lower than at any time since October 2023, said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Access to food continues to deteriorate, with prices of essentials on the black market soaring. Cooking gas rose by 2,612 percent, diesel by 1,315 percent and wood by 250 percent, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Concurrent with the extremely high and increasing prices of essential items has been the total collapse of livelihoods to be able to purchase or barter for food and other basic needs," said the alert.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body expressed concern over Israel's cutting ties last month with the UN aid agency for Palestinians (UNRWA), warning of "extremely serious consequences for humanitarian operations" in Gaza. (AFP)

    S Sudan floods affect 1.4 million, displace 379,000

<img alt="Four straight years of flooding linked to climate change has left the world's youngest nation suffering from severe food insecurity and outbreaks of disease. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778331_1_20241109194114.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Devastating flooding in South Sudan is affecting around 1.4 million people, with more than 379,000 displaced, according to a United Nations update that warned about an upsurge in malaria.
 <br>
  <br>
  Aid agencies have said that the world's youngest country, highly vulnerable to climate change, is in the grip of its worst flooding in decades, mainly in the north.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said about 1.4 million people were affected by floods in 43 counties and the disputed Abyei region, which is claimed by both South Sudan and Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over 379,000 individuals are displaced in 22 counties and Abyei," it added in a statement issued late on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A surge in malaria has been reported in several states, it said, "overwhelming the health system and exacerbating the situation and impact in flood-hit areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, the world's youngest nation has remained plagued by chronic instability, violence and economic stagnation as well as climate disasters such as drought and floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Bank said last month that the latest floods were "worsening an already critical humanitarian situation marked by severe food insecurity, economic decline, continued conflict, disease outbreaks, and the repercussions of the Sudan conflict," which has seen several hundred thousand people pour into South Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than seven million people are food insecure in South Sudan and 1.65 million children are malnourished, according to the UN's World Food Programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country also faces another period of political paralysis after the president's office announced in September yet another extension to a transitional period agreed in a 2018 peace deal, delaying elections by two years to December 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key provisions of the transitional agreement remain unfulfilled – including the creation of a constitution and the unification of the rival forces of President Salva Kiir and his foe Reik Machar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delay has left South Sudan's partners and the United Nations exasperated, with UN envoy Nicholas Haysom on Thursday describing it as a "regrettable development."
  <br>
  <br>
  All local and international parties involved "must collectively seize the opportunity to make this extension the last, and deliver the peace and democracy that the people of South Sudan deserve," added Haysom.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Sudan boasts plentiful oil resources but the vital source of revenue was decimated in February when an export pipeline was damaged in neighbouring war-torn Sudan. (AFP)

    Rome's Trevi Fountain opens temporary tourist catwalk

<img alt="For the time being at least, people can view the famous architecture from a completely different perspective. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778343_1_20241109213345.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A suspended walkway providing tourists an up-close view of Rome's Trevi Fountain was unveiled on Saturday, a temporary addition while the famous "La Dolce Vita" site undergoes cleaning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Baroque masterpiece constructed on the facade of a palace is one of the most popular sites in Rome for tourists, who strain over the crowds to throw their coins into its water.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the fountain is being cleaned to remove limestone deposits and grime, however, the walkway positioned over its basin will accommodate some 130 people at a time to take a closer look.
  <br>
  <br>
  That will give tourists "an experience not ruined by excessive crowding," said Rome's mayor, Roberto Gualtieri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wanted to give everybody the opportunity to admire the fountain and to do this from a unique perspective, because what you can see from the walkway, you will never be able to see normally," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  French tourist Franc Petretto, 50, was one of the first to walk across the passageway, calling the view "wonderful and very, very beautiful."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even without the water flowing inside the fountain, you can really see that the architecture is serious... and that's really very pleasing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Micaela di Caterina, a 32-year-old visiting from Argentina, agreed, saying the up-close look at the intricate sculptures of Oceanus, father of the river gods, and his sea-horses was "incredible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, she acknowledged, it was "kind of weird" to be walking over the fountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fountain – where Anita Ekberg frolicked in Federico Fellini's 1960 film "La Dolce Vita" – last got a thorough scrub a decade ago during an 18-month renovation sponsored by Fendi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, too, the Italian fashion house installed a plexiglass bridge above the basin allowing tourists to still admire the fountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The current work involves removing limestone deposits on the fountain's facade, which can turn black with time, while removing loose material between stones where vegetation grows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists won't be allowed to toss coins over their shoulders into the fountain's basin – where tradition has it that visitors who do so will return to Rome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, a small pool set up next to the walkway has been installed to receive spare change.
  <br>
  <br>
  That pool "allows us to avoid throwing coins, which, without water, would damage the fountain," Gualtieri said, adding that anyone doing so would be fined.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also allows the flow of donations to Rome's needy to continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Every week, authorities recuperated some 10,000 euros in coins from Trevi Fountain, which were donated to the Caritas charity to fund meals, said Gaultieri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proud not to have interrupted such important work for those in difficulty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The walkway will be up until the cleaning is complete, sometime in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaultieri said city officials were still considering a possible ticketing system to control the crowds at Trevi Fountain once the cleaning is over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor numbers are expected to surge next year for the Jubilee, a holy year held by the Catholic Church around once every 25 years, with some 30 million people expected in Rome and the Vatican. (AFP)

 Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday that Israeli air strikes killed at least 14 Palestinians overnight, including women and children, while the Israeli military said it had eliminated dozens of militants in the territory's north.
 <br>
  <br>
  An air strike hit tents housing displaced Palestinians in the southern area of Khan Younis, killing at least nine people, including children and women, said civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Red Crescent also confirmed the toll, saying 11 others were wounded in the strike and were taken to Nasser Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second air strike killed five people, including children, and injured about 22 when "Israeli warplanes hit Fahad Al-Sabah school," which had been turned into a shelter for "thousands of displaced people" in the Al-Tuffah district of Gaza City, Bassal said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dead and injured were taken to Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent months, the military has struck several schools-turned-shelters where Israel has said Palestinian militants are operating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Israeli military said its troops killed "dozens of terrorists" in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, where it has been conducting a sweeping air and ground operation for more than a month to prevent Hamas from regrouping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces also killed several militants in the area of Rafah in the territory's south, the military added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military is currently engaged in a two-front war, with troops fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past day, the IAF (air force) struck over 50 terror targets in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip," the military said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the targets struck were military structures, weapons storage facilities and launchers," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's war in Gaza broke out after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7 last year, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people on Israeli side, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures, which included those who died and were killed in captivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the attack, militants abducted 251 people, 97 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 43,508 people, a majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

 A bombing claimed by Pakistani separatists killed 26 people including 14 soldiers at a railway station in the southwestern Balochistan province, a hospital spokesman said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blast hit as passengers waited on a platform at the main railway station in the provincial capital Quetta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fourteen members of the army and 12 civilians were killed," said Wasim Baig, spokesman for Quetta's Sandeman Provincial Hospital, raising an earlier toll of 25 provided by police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty-six members of the security forces and 14 civilians were wounded, the spokesman added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Journalists saw pools of blood and ripped backpacks at the scene, where a large metal sheet protecting passengers from the elements had been blown off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite frequent attacks in Balochistan the toll of Saturday's blast was particularly high for the southwestern province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The train station explosion hit at around 8:45 am (0345 GMT) and was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), one of the area's main separatist groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack "was carried out on a Pakistani army unit at Quetta railway station... after completing a course at the Infantry School," the BLA said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Associated Press of Pakistan, the official news agency, cited railway officials as saying the blast happened near the ticket booth when two trains were scheduled to depart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the attackers "will pay a heavy price," according to a statement from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BLA frequently claims deadly attacks against security forces or Pakistanis from other provinces, notably Punjabis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Quetta station, police said they were working to determine the cause of the blast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we reached here, initially it appeared that some explosive had perhaps been hidden or left in the luggage. But now we think it may be a suicide bomber," Muhammad Baloch, a senior local police official, told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters, rescuers and passengers were working through abandoned luggage on the platform, guarded by heavily armed members of the security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Militants have in the past targeted energy projects with foreign financing, accusing outsiders of exploiting the resource-rich region while excluding residents in the poorest part of Pakistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August, the BLA claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks by dozens of assailants who killed at least 39 people, one of the highest tolls to hit the region. (AFP)
