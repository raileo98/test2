    Russia jails lawyers of late dissident Navalny

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three lawyers who once represented the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny were jailed on Friday in Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vadim Kobzev, Igor Sergunin and Alexei Liptser were jailed from 3.5 to five years by a court in the town of Petushki, about 100 kilometres east of Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were arrested in October 2023 on charges of involvement with extremist groups, as Navalny’s networks were deemed extremist by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was widely seen as a way to increase pressure on the opposition to discourage defence lawyers from taking political cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time, Navalny was serving a 19-year prison term on several criminal convictions, including extremism.
  <br>
  <br>
  He died in a Russian prison camp in February 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and outspoken opponent of President Vladimir Putin, was arrested in 2021 upon his return from Germany, where he was recuperating from a nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was ordered to serve 2.5 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  After two more trials, his sentence was extended to 19 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his allies said the charges were politically motivated and accused the Kremlin of seeking to jail him for life.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December 2023, Navalny was moved from a penal colony in the Vladimir region east of Moscow to one above the Arctic Circle, where he died in February at the age of 47 under still-unexplained circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, and members of his team alleged he was killed on orders from the Kremlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian government has rejected the accusation. (AP)

    Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan jailed for 14 years

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistan court on Friday convicted former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in a landmark graft case, sentencing Khan to 14 years in prison.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan has been held in custody since August 2023 charged with around 200 cases, but his party claim the latest conviction was being used to pressure him into silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief," Khan told reporters inside the court room after his conviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft court convened in the jail near the capital Islamabad where Khan is being held, and convicted him along with his wife over a welfare foundation they established together called the Al-Qadir Trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The prosecution has proven its case. Khan is convicted," said Judge Nasir Javed Rana, announcing a 14 year sentence for Khan and seven years for Bibi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faith healer Bibi, who was recently released on bail, was arrested at the court after the conviction, her spokeswoman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan maintains the cases are politically motivated and designed to keep him from returning to power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentence has been delayed several times over the past month, with analysts saying the jail term was being used to pressure Khan into accepting a deal with the military to step back from politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since being ousted from power in 2022, Khan has launched an unprecedented campaign in which he has openly criticised the country's powerful generals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan had previously been handed four convictions, two of which have been overturned while the sentences in the other two cases were suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he remained in prison over pending cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN panel of experts found last year that Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office".
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan was barred from standing in February's election and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were hamstrung by a widespread crackdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  PTI won more seats than any other party in the poll, but a coalition of parties considered more pliable to the influence of the military establishment shut them out of power. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian mother has been charged with poisoning her one-year-old baby girl and posting video of the infant's distress to get online GoFundMe donations, police and local media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old woman allegedly went to "great lengths" to conceal that she was giving prescription and pharmacy drugs to the baby without medical approval, Queensland detective inspector Paul Dalton told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital staff in the Queensland capital Brisbane alerted police to their suspicions in October last year when the girl was there for treatment of a serious mental condition, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police took "immediate action" to protect the baby and launched an investigation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman from Queensland's Sunshine Coast was widely reported in local media to be the baby's mother, though police would not officially confirm this.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was accused of filming and posting images of the baby's "immense distress and pain" between August and October last year to elicit financial donations from online followers, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Testing for unauthorised medicines allegedly returned a positive result this month, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was charged on Thursday with 11 offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no words to describe just how repulsive offences of this nature are," Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no excuse for hurting a child, particularly one so young that is totally dependent on adults to care and love for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman is accused of raising just over Aus$60,000 (US$37,000) via GoFundMe, which was working to return the money to donors, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was scheduled to appear at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Thursday accused Hamas of backtracking on parts of the Gaza ceasefire deal announced a day earlier, and said the cabinet will not meet on the deal until Hamas's agreement is confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has reneged on parts of the agreement reached with the mediators and Israel in an effort to extort last-minute concessions," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement, adding the situation created a "last minute crisis."
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not specify which parts of the deal were at issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the Israeli cabinet, which has yet to approve the agreement, "will not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Key mediator Qatar said on Wednesday that Israel and Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza starting on Sunday, along with a hostage and prisoner exchange after more than 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States also announced the deal, which largely reproduces the framework of a blueprint presented by President Joe Biden in May 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-three Israeli hostages will be released in the first, 42-day, phase of the agreement, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan was stabbed in a scuffle with an intruder at his home early on Thursday and underwent surgery at a hospital, media reports said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 54-year-old actor was taken to the hospital from his home in Mumbai, the country's financial and entertainment capital, where he lives with his movie star wife Kareena Kapoor and two sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the six wounds were deep, with one near his spine, the Press Trust of India news agency cited a doctor at Mumbai’s Lilavati Hospital as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian media quoted police as saying the intruder barged into the house at about 2.30am and fled after stabbing Khan.
  <br>
  <br>
  A female employee at Khan's home was also injured during the attack and was being treated, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are investigating and have launched a search for the attacker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kapoor, Khan' wife, said in a statement that his family was fine and requested “the media and fans to be patient and not speculate any further as the police is already doing their due investigations.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan, who is also a movie producer, has been featured in about 70 films and television series.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the son of former Indian cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won multiple awards for his roles in Hindi cinema, including seven Filmfare Awards. In 2010, he received the Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award. (AP)

    China welcomes Gaza ceasefire deal

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said it welcomed a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and the Hamas militant group, vowing "unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East".
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also sincerely hope that relevant parties will take the ceasefire in Gaza as an opportunity to promote the easing of regional tensions," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Qatar and the United States announced a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce would take effect on Sunday and involve the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, after which the terms of a broader peace deal would be finalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing on Thursday said it hoped the "agreement can be effectively implemented to achieve a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  China would "continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza and make positive efforts to resume post-war reconstruction," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will work with the international community to make unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, said the deal was the "right move" to bring back hostages seized during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  That attack, the deadliest in Israeli history, resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a media tallies of official Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's ensuing campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,707 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    First successful launch for Blue Origin rocket

<div class="itemFullText">
 Blue Origin, the space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, launched its massive New Glenn rocket for the first time early on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rocket, whose inaugural mission had been delayed by several years, blasted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Base in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission is seen as critical to Blue Origin's efforts to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX, which dominates the commercial space industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "LIFTOFF! New Glenn is beginning its first ever ascent toward the stars," Blue Origin said on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "New Glenn has passed the Karman line, the internationally recognised boundary of space!" the firm posted just a few minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  And then: "Second stage engine cutoff confirmed. New Glenn's second stage and payload are now in orbit."
  <br>
  <br>
  An initial test launch of the towering 98-metre rocket, dubbed New Glenn in honour of the legendary American astronaut John Glenn, had been scrubbed early on Monday morning after repeated halts during the countdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company later said it had discovered an icing issue on a purge line and would aim for a possible early Tuesday morning launch, but that weather conditions were unfavourable.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday night, Blue Origin announced that launch had been postponed.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the mission, dubbed NG-1, Amazon founder Bezos is taking aim at the only man in the world wealthier than him: fellow tech innovator Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk's company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its prolific Falcon 9 rockets, which have become vital for the commercial sector, the Pentagon and Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town, and so having a competitor... this is great," G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior Nasa official, earlier told reporters, expecting the competition to drive down costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upping the high-stakes rivalry, SpaceX also plans another orbital test this week of Starship -- its gargantuan new-generation rocket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin will now attempt to land New Glenn's first-stage booster on a drone ship stationed about 1,000 kilometres downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX has made such landings now routine, but this will be Blue Origin's first shot at the sci-fi feat.
  <br>
  <br>
  High seas last week caused the New Glenn launch to be pushed back several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the rocket's upper stage will fire its engines toward Earth orbit, reaching a maximum altitude of roughly 12,000 miles above the surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Defence Department-funded prototype of an advanced spaceship called Blue Ring, which could one day journey through the solar system, will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin has experience landing its New Shepard rockets -- used for suborbital tourism -- but they are five times smaller and land on terra firma rather than a ship at sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Physically, the gleaming white New Glenn dwarfs SpaceX's 230-foot Falcon 9 and is designed for heavier payloads.
  <br>
  <br>
  It slots between Falcon 9 and its big sibling, Falcon Heavy, in terms of mass capacity but holds an edge with its wider payload fairing, capable of carrying the equivalent of 20 moving trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin has already secured a Nasa contract to launch two Mars probes aboard New Glenn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rocket will also support the deployment of Project Kuiper, a satellite Internet constellation designed to compete with Starlink.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, however, SpaceX maintains a commanding lead, while other rivals -- United Launch Alliance, Arianespace, and Rocket Lab -- trail far behind. (AFP)

    South Korea's Yoon refuses to attend questioning

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's arrested President Yoon Suk Yeol does not intend to take part in a second day of questioning on Thursday, his lawyer said, further stonewalling a criminal probe into whether he committed insurrection with his martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested, was taken to the Seoul Detention Centre on Wednesday evening after refusing to cooperate, where he was expected to have spent the night in a solitary cell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have 48 hours to question the suspended president, after which they must release him or seek a warrant to detain him for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's refusal to cooperate with investigators comes as the Constitutional Court is due to hold a second hearing in his impeachment trial to determine whether to remove him permanently or reinstate his presidential powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea is grappling with a political crisis sparked by Yoon's brief attempt to impose martial law on December 3 that was voted down by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's arrest on Wednesday ended a weeks-long standoff with authorities after police swooped before dawn on his fortified hillside villa in Seoul to the despair of followers at the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he turned himself in for questioning by corruption investigation officials to prevent what he called the risk of "unsavoury bloodshed", though he continued to protest that it was an illegal investigation and invalid arrest warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has up to now refused to talk with investigators who had prepared a questionnaire of more than 200 pages, an official from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) that is heading the criminal inquiry said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embattled leader did not even reply to a question, a CIO official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His questioning is due to resume at 2 pm local time, on Thursday, according to CIO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yoon Kab-keun, one of Yoon’s lawyers, said in a text message to reporters that Yoon would not show up for the questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap reported the same lawyer as citing Yoon's health as a factor and saying further questioning was pointless, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CIO official said he understood it was possible to forcibly bring Yoon for questioning but would make further checks on relevant laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small crowd of protesters supporting Yoon gathered and sat on a road outside the CIO office, calling the president's arrest illegitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opinion polls show a majority of South Koreans support impeaching Yoon, but the attempts to arrest him appear to have rallied his hardcore supporters. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Firefighters reported significant gains on Wednesday against the two massive wildfires burning around Los Angeles, while also extinguishing smaller blazes set by arsonists in recent days as a final round of windy, flame-fanning weather moved through Southern California.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Particularly Dangerous Situation red-flag warning expired in the afternoon, but dry conditions and gusty winds were forecast to linger into Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  So much of the nation’s second-most populous metropolitan region remained on alert for new outbreaks and flare-ups from the fires, which have killed at least 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Wednesday, gusts whipped up to 80 kph in the mountains, though many areas saw relatively light winds late in the morning, according to the National Weather Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Better conditions expected in the coming days should help fire crews make even more headway and allow residents to return to their neighbourhoods to begin rebuilding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, firefighters and police faced new challenges. Since the beginning of the wildfire outbreak last week, authorities have arrested about half a dozen people accused of setting new, small fires that were quickly knocked down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have not determined a cause for the major blazes in what is on track to become the nation’s costliest fire disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  More manageable winds on Tuesday allowed firefighters to make gains on the two most destructive fires. Almost half of the Eaton Fire just north of LA was contained, and one-fifth of the fire that destroyed much of the seaside neighbourhood of Pacific Palisades was surrounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of those broke out on January 7. (AP)

    Biden warns dangerous oligarchy taking shape in US

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden urged Americans on Wednesday to "stand guard" against threats from oligarchs, disinformation and AI in a future under Donald Trump as he delivered a dark farewell address ahead of stepping down next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden, who will be succeeded by Trump on Monday, touted his achievements in steering the US economy out of the deep crisis inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and said he had made the nation's alliances abroad stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, in his brief Oval Office speech on live television, the Democrat quickly turned to painting a series of dangers facing the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clearly referring to Trump's close ties to the world's richest man Elon Musk and other tech tycoons, Biden said an "oligarchy is taking shape in America" - and "a dangerous concentration of power."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the ultra-rich around Trump represented a concentration of "extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden recalled the stark warning issued by president Dwight Eisenhower in his own farewell address in 1961 about the dangers of an out-of-control military industrial complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech industrial complex," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And a "crumbling" media means Americans are increasingly vulnerable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power," the outgoing president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also clearly referring to Trump's plans to roll back environmental protections and withdraw from a major international global accord on combating global warming, Biden said "powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we've taken to tackle the climate crisis, to serve their own interest for power and profit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Naming another increasingly global challenge, Biden said artificial intelligence "is the most consequential technology of our time" that could bring huge benefits but also poses "risks for our economy and our security, our society." (AFP)

    UK report says patient safety is being compromised

 UK patients are "coming to harm" as nurses say they are having to treat people in corridors and unsuitable places because of a "collapse in care standards", a report said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the latest indictment of Britain's beleaguered state-funded National Health Service, nine in 10 NHS nurses surveyed by the country's nurses union said "patient safety is being compromised".
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly seven in 10 said they were delivering care in "overcrowded or unsuitable places" on a "daily basis", including in corridors, converted cupboards, car parks and even bereavement rooms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The experiences of over 5,000 nursing staff across the UK highlight a devastating collapse in care standards, with patients routinely coming to harm," said the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).
  <br>
  <br>
  The report condemns the "normalisation" of so-called "corridor care", with nurses unable to access life-saving equipment in cramped spaces and patients even dying in corridors.
  <br>
  <br>
  One nurse in east England said corridor care in their hospital trust was "not an exception, it's the rule".
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, some 54,000 patients in emergency departments in England had to wait over 12 hours until a hospital bed was available, up 23 percent from December 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the RCN report testimonies are accounts of nurses treating up to 40 patients waiting in a corridor, as well as reports of pregnant women miscarrying in corridors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some reported overcrowded corridors impeding them from giving life-saving resuscitation (CPR). One nurse recalled a patient dying after a cardiac arrest "by the male toilet".
  <br>
  <br>
  Another alleged having to treat cardiac arrests "with no crash bell, crash trolley, oxygen, defibrillator... straddling a patient doing CPR while everyone watches on".
  <br>
  <br>
  There are some 7.5 million people on the NHS waiting list, with more than three million having faced delays longer than 18 weeks for treatment. (AFP)

    Indonesia to push social media protections

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia is planning to impose interim child protection guidelines on social media companies while the government carves out a law to set a minimum age for users of the platforms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Communications minister Meutya Hafid has said the government plans to issue a regulation to set a minimum age for social media users, after discussing the proposal to protect children online with President Prabowo Subianto.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows Australia's decision to ban children under 16 from accessing social media, with fines for tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta to TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, if they fail to prevent children from accessing their platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the minister means is that the government is headed for the direction of a stronger regulation on age limit, which is through the formation of a law," said Alexander Sabar, a senior official at the communications and digital ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, he said the government will issue a regulation for digital platforms, including social media companies, to adhere to child protection guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The emphasis for the government regulation is child protection - how they are protected from physical, mental, or moral perils," he said, adding that the regulation would not totally limit children's access to social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nurmayanti, a 46-year-old mother of three, said she agreed with the plan to curtail social media content, particularly content promoting pornography or discrimination.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They now can freely open social media so that is concerning to us as parents," she said, adding the law must be strict and clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Anis Hidayah, a commissioner at Indonesia's main human rights body, said that limiting the internet for children was important but the government must be careful not to curb their right to information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 50 percent of children under 12 in tech-savvy Indonesia use the internet, with some respondents of that age group using Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, according to a survey by the Indonesia internet service providers' association. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds of Gazans chanted and embraced on Wednesday as news spread that a ceasefire and hostage release deal had been reached between Israel and Hamas aimed at ending more than 15 months of war in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a US official and a source close to the negotiations first revealed the agreement, Israel cautioned that several points "remain unresolved" that it hoped would be addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But celebrations were already underway in Gaza, where journalists saw crowds of people hugging and taking photos to mark the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't believe that this nightmare of more than a year is finally coming to an end. We have lost so many people, we've lost everything," said Randa Sameeh, a 45-year-old who was displaced from Gaza City to the Nuseirat Camp in the centre of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need a lot of rest. As soon as the truce begins, I will go to the cemetery to visit my brother and family members. We buried them in Deir el-Balah cemetery without proper graves. We will build them new graves and write their names on them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside Deir al-Balah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where so many of the war's casualties have been taken, hundreds of Palestinians gathered to chant, sing and wave flags, AFPTV footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point, a member of the crowd and a journalist in body armour were raised on people's shoulders to conduct an interview above the mass of elated Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, The "final details" of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal are still being worked on, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in the early hours of Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to US President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to thank them for helping to secure a deal for the release of hostages held in Gaza, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least 20 people were killed in Israeli strikes after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was announced on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Drake on Wednesday filed suit against his own label, saying Universal Music Group's release and promotion of a Kendrick Lamar track dissing him amounted to defamation and harassment.
 <br>
  <br>
  UMG, which is behind both Drake and Lamar, adamantly denied the accusations, saying "the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist -- let alone Drake -- is illogical" given the company's longtime investment in helping him "achieve historic commercial and personal financial success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year the two superstar rappers exchanged a litany of increasingly vitriolic diss tracks, with Lamar delivering the major blow with his chart-topping, Grammy-nominated song "Not Like Us."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his suit, Drake said Universal betrayed him in favor of profits by promoting the song with punchlines that accuse him of pedophilia.

  In the documents filed in Manhattan's federal court, Drake says Universal "approved, published, and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track" that was "intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian artist born Aubrey Drake Graham, 38, says the record company chose "corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawsuit cited the track's promotion as causing a "physical threat to Drake's safety" as well as a "bombardment of online harassment."
  <br>
  <br>
  It cited a pre-dawn shooting last May that saw a gunman wound a security guard at the superstar rapper's estate in Toronto, and described subsequent break-in attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These events were not coincidental," the suit said, before detailing the defamation allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake, the reigning highest-grossing rapper, is not taking legal action against Lamar, and he is not suing over the lyrics themselves. (AFP)

 Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal to halt fighting in Gaza and exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, an official briefed on the deal told Reuters on Wednesday, opening the way to a possible end to a 15-month war that has upended the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agreement follows months of on-off negotiations brokered by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, with the backing of the United States, and came just ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli troops invaded Gaza after Hamas-led gunmen broke through security barriers and burst into Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 and kidnapping more than 250 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 people, mostly women and children, and left the narrow coastal enclave a wasteland of rubble, with hundreds of thousands surviving the winter cold in tents and makeshift shelters.
  <br>
  <br>
  As his inauguration approached, Trump repeated his demand that a deal be done swiftly, warning repeatedly that there would be "hell to pay" if the hostages were not released. His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff worked with President Joe Biden's team to push the deal over the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, the return of the hostages may ease some of the public anger against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Oct. 7 security failure and not securing a hostage deal until now.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conflict spread across the Middle East, with groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen attacking Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian authorities in the west of the country on Wednesday said that critical infrastructure facilities had been targeted in a "massive" Russian missile attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Critical infrastructure facilities were targeted in Prykarpattia," the regional governor of the western Ivano-Frankivsk region wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Air defence forces were working in the region," the official, Svitlana Onyshchuk, said, adding there were no casualties and that the situation was "under control."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in the western Lviv region, which borders EU and Nato member Poland, said two critical infrastructure facilities had been hit in the Drogobych and Stryi districts, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fortunately, there were no casualties, but there was damage," governor Maksym Kozytsky wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian national grid operator meanwhile announced it was introducing emergency blackouts in seven regions including the eastern Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  The apparent barrage came just one day after Ukraine said it had carried out its largest aerial attack on Russian territory, hitting factories and energy hubs hundreds of miles from the front line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Defence Ministry confirmed the attack on Tuesday, accusing Ukraine of using US- and British-made long-range missiles and drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Wednesday, the ministry said that its forces had "carried out a group strike with precision-guided weapons and attack drones against critical gas and energy infrastructure supporting the work of Ukraine's military-industrial complex." (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over insurrection accusations related to his December 3 martial law declaration, investigators said.
 <br>
  <br>
  A motorcade was seen leaving the gates of his hillside residence where Yoon has been holed up for weeks behind barbed wire barriers and a small army of personal security.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 3,000 police officers and anti-corruption investigators had gathered there before dawn, pushing through throngs of Yoon supporters and members of his ruling People Power Party who protested attempts to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers have argued attempts to detain Yoon are illegal and are designed to publicly humiliate him. The warrant investigators secured for his arrest is the first-ever issued against an incumbent South Korean president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has justified his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance against an "anti-state" opposition employing its legislative majority to thwart his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-corruption agency is leading a joint investigation with police and the military over whether Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an attempted rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law enforcement officers had sought to bring him into custody after he ignored several summons for questioning. (Agencies)

    New wildfire warnings issued as winds rise in LA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Southern Californians faced new wildfire warnings on Tuesday, and tens of thousands saw their power shut off as strong winds blew across the parched landscape around Los Angeles where two massive blazes have been burning for a week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Santa Ana winds that began gusting over the mountains before sunrise were forecast to continue until Wednesday morning with enough force to carry fire-sparking embers for miles and stoke new outbreaks in a region where at least 25 people have already been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Life threatening and destructive and widespread winds are already here,” LA city fire chief Kristin Crowley told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Southern California was under elevated fire risk, with crews on high alert from the Mexican border to Central California, far north of Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 90,000 households lost electricity as utilities shut off power to prevent their lines from sparking new blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weary and anxious residents were told to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police announced roughly 50 arrests, for looting, flying drones in fire zones, violating curfew and other crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest worry remained the threat from intense winds predicted to reach nearly hurricane force in some areas. Tuesday's forecast included a rare warning: The winds, combined with severely dry conditions, have created a “Particularly Dangerous Situation,” the National Weather service said, meaning that any new fire could explode in size.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gusts were forecast to pick up strength in the evening and into Wednesday before decreasing, and red-flag warnings from Central California to the Mexican border were to remain through most of Wednesday, weather service meteorologist Ariel Cohen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals while crews and fire engines deployed to particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials - who were criticised over their initial response - expressed confidence that the region was ready to face the new threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  With almost no rain in more than eight months, the brush-filled region has had more than a dozen wildfires this year, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just under 90,000 people in the county remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week. (AP)

    Elon Musk sued over late disclosure of Twitter stake

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the world's richest person of waiting too long to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social media company he later bought.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a complaint filed in Washington, DC federal court, the SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his initial purchase of five per cent of Twitter's common shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days, or by March 24, 2022 in Musk's case, when they cross a five per cent ownership threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk instead bought more than US$500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2 percent stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twitter's share price rose more than 27 per cent following that disclosure, the SEC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and disgorge profits he didn't deserve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk eventually purchased Twitter for US$44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that "all indications" were that his delay was a mistake. (Reuters)

    US TikTok users flock to Chinese app Xiaohongshu

<div class="itemFullText">
 As the threat of a TikTok ban looms in the United States, users there are flocking to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu - making it the top downloaded app in the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the “TikTok refugees,” as they call themselves, say the TikTok alternative, a Chinese app, is being chosen in protest of the TikTok ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Supreme Court is due to rule on a law that stipulates TikTok must be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance by January 19 or face a ban in the US over national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the justices seemed inclined to let the law stand, masses of TikTok users began creating accounts on Xiaohongshu, including hashtags such as #tiktokrefugee or #tiktok to their posts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Monday, Xiaohongshu has become the top downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaohongshu, which in English means “Little Red Book”, is a Chinese social media app that combines e-commerce, short video and posting functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app has gained traction in China and other regions and countries with a Chinese diaspora, racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as make-up and skincare tutorials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The #tiktokrefugee topic has racked up over 160,000 posts on Xiaohongshu, many of which are videos of American users introducing themselves and asking for tips on how to navigate the app, which they are calling “RedNote”.
  <br>
  <br>
  An American user with the handle Definitelynotchippy made a video addressed to the Chinese users of Xiaohongshu, explaining why Americans are downloading the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they’re insisting that it’s owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,” she said. “And they’re trying to make us think that you guys are bad.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese users on Xiaohongshu have so far welcomed American users, with some offering to teach them Chinese. Others have offered tips on navigating the Chinese internet. In some cases, Chinese students have asked the Americans for help with their English homework. (AP)

    UK launches probe into dominance of Google search

<img alt="The Competition and Markets Authority will probe whether Google is using its position to prevent innovation by others in the search engine market. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787536_1_20250114213240.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's competition watchdog on Tuesday launched an investigation into Google's dominant position in the search engine market and its impact on consumers and businesses.
 <br>
  <br>
  The investigation could lead to the US tech giant being handed "strategic market status", subjecting it to special requirements under new UK regulations, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CMA will probe whether "Google is using its position to prevent innovation by others" in the search engine market and whether it gives "self-preference" to its own services.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also look into "potential exploitative conduct" including investigating the collection and use of large quantities of consumer data without informed consent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the UK's tougher new regulation that came into force this year, the watchdog has been given more powers to develop and enforce conduct requirements on companies to prevent anti-competitive behaviour in digital markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potential requirements could include Google having to make the data it collects available to other businesses or giving publishers more control over how their data is used, the CMA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar tech competition law from the European Union, the Digital Markets Act, carries hefty financial penalties for giants like Apple, Google and Meta in the event of infringements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Millions of people and businesses across the UK rely on Google's search and advertising services, with 90 percent of searches happening on their platform and more than 200,000 UK businesses advertising there," CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why it's so important to ensure these services are delivering good outcomes for people and businesses and that there is a level playing field," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google is also fighting an antitrust crackdown in the United States after the Department of Justice (DOJ) asked a federal court in November to order it to sell its widely-used Chrome browser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DOJ also asked the court to ban deals for Google to be the default search engine on smartphones and prevent it from exploiting its Android mobile operating system. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators seeking to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol were involved in clashes as they tried to execute a new warrant at his official residence, Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Investigators in physical clash as they attempt to forcibly enter presidential residence," the agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came as thousands of the embattled leader's die-hard supporters massed outside the presidential residence in the capital Seoul to protect Yoon, AFP reporters saw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's short-lived December 3 imposition of martial law plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators said they would detain anyone who tried to block their bid to execute a new warrant, after they arrived at the presidential residence Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two CIO vehicles have arrived in front of the (presidential) residence," Yonhap News TV reported, referring to the Corruption Investigation Office that is probing Yoon's declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the court-ordered warrant is successfully executed, Yoon would become the first sitting president in South Korean history to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a first attempt to arrest Yoon on January 3 failed after a tense hours-long standoff with his presidential guards, who refused to budge when investigators tried to execute their warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A joint team of the CIO and police have since secured a new warrant and massed as many as 1,000 personnel for Wednesday's attempt to detain Yoon, according to local media reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also threatened to detain any guards who obstruct the sitting leader's arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Personnel who appeared to be guarding the entrance from outsiders were seen walking from the residence towards its entrance gate early Wednesday, AFP reporters saw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters of Yoon were also heard chanting "illegal warrant!" while waving glow sticks and South Korean and American flags. (AFP)

<img alt="Los Angeles city fire chief Kristin Crowley says teams are in place ready to repel any new fires. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787545_1_20250114224256.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hot, powerful winds on Tuesday threatened to rekindle and whip up major fires that have devastated the hills and suburbs of Los Angeles, killing at least 24 people and changing the face of America's second biggest city forever.
 <br>
  <br>
  A week after blazes erupted and spread uncontained, forecasters predicted "particularly dangerous" dry Santa Ana winds would spike the wildfire threat for already exhausted firefighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stay aware of your surroundings. Be ready to evacuate. Avoid anything that can spark a fire," the National Weather Service warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  A large part of Southern California was under a Red Flag warning, indicating that intense dryness and furious winds would make conditions ripe for wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of Los Angeles County and much of neighbouring Ventura County were in a "Particularly Dangerous Situation," according to the NWS, a designation that was also declared before last week's deadly blazes erupted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials insisted they were poised, with Los Angeles city fire chief Kristin Crowley telling reporters a huge firefighting operation was well placed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have strategically pre-positioned engine strike teams and task forces which are dedicated to rapid response for any new fire that breaks out," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed danger comes with 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) of the upmarket Pacific Palisades in ruins and 14,000 acres of the city of Altadena badly charred.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90,000 evacuees are desperate to get back to their homes – or even just to see if anything at all survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My house is gone, I know that. I've seen pictures and all that's left is the chimney. But I need to see it by myself to believe it," said Fred Busche.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the desperation, there were stories of fortitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeff Ridgway told how he had refused to abandon the apartment complex he manages, defending it against the fires by hauling buckets of water from the pool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was just a war," the 67-year-old said, pointing to a eucalyptus tree he extinguished when it caught fire and threatened the building last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I was just stubborn. I was like: 'I'm not going to be defeated by you. I'm sorry, this is just not gonna happen.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  Search teams using cadaver dogs have been scouring the rubble for days, with Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna saying he expected more victims would be unearthed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every day we're doing this, we're running across the remains of individual community members," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we'll continue to find remains."
  <br>
  <br>
  With so many in dire straits, the city was clutching for any sliver of good news.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was offered by the Los Angeles Rams, who beat the Minnesota Vikings in an NFL playoff game on Monday night to take them one step closer to the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game, which had been scheduled to take place in Los Angeles, was moved to Arizona to relieve pressure on stretched law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Basketball fans also had a welcomed diversion from the fires when the Lakers played the San Antonio Spurs at home, although they lost 102-126.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers were among a dozen city sports clubs – also including the Dodgers baseball team – that have pledged US$8 million toward wildfire relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mainstay entertainment industry was also stepping up, with major studios and streamers including Netflix, Disney, Amazon, Warner and Universal parent company Comcast having all announced eight-figure donations to the recovery effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there were also many stories of individual generosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a converted parking lot in Arcadia, 600 people showed up in a single day to distribute donated supplies to evacuees, organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many had been redirected from other shelters that also could not accommodate the extra help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very different experience than any other volunteering that I typically do. Because there's really no difference between the people that are helping and the people that are being helped," said 19-year-old student Gianna Karkafi.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just, like, luck." (AFP)

<img alt='Donald Trump called special counsel Jack Smith "deranged" after his report said he would have been convicted for his alleged effort to overturn the 2020 election. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787484_1_20250114164938.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump would have been convicted for his alleged effort to overturn the 2020 election result if he hadn't been elected four years later, said a report by then special counsel Jack Smith released early on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of Justice's "view that the Constitution prohibits the continued indictment and prosecution of a President is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Office stands fully behind," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Indeed, but for Mr Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the (Special Counsel's) Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who returns to the White House on January 20, had been accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the session of Congress called to certify US President Joe Biden's election win but which was violently attacked on January 6, 2021 by a mob of the Republican's supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith, who was special counsel appointed to investigate Trump, dropped the federal criminal case against the incoming leader after he won November's presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after the report's overnight release, Trump hit back on his Truth Social platform, calling Smith "deranged", and adding he "was unable to successfully prosecute the Political Opponent of his 'boss'."
  <br>
  <br>
  "To show you how desperate Deranged Jack Smith is, he released his Fake findings at 1am in the morning," Trump added in another post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's attorneys had earlier urged US Attorney General Merrick Garland not to release the report, calling the plan to release it "unlawful, undertaken in bad faith, and contrary to the public interest."
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith's report details Trump's alleged efforts to persuade state-level Republican lawmakers and leaders to "change the results" of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Trump contacted state legislators and executives, pressured them with false claims of election fraud in their states, and urged them to take action to ignore the vote counts and change the results," according to the report released by the Department of Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significantly, he made election claims only to state legislators and executives who shared his political affiliation and were his political supporters, and only in states that he had lost," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, the report alleges Trump and co-conspirators planned to organise individuals who would have served as his electors, if he had won the popular vote, in seven states where he lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- "and cause them to sign and send to Washington false certifications claiming to be the legitimate electors."
  <br>
  <br>
  They ultimately "used the fraudulent certificates to try to obstruct the congressional certification proceeding," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The special counsel office concluded that "Trump's conduct violated several federal criminal statutes and that the admissible evidence would be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed a separate case against the former and future president last year -- over Trump's handling of top secret documents after leaving the White House -- but charges are still pending against two of his former co-defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith left the justice department last week, days after submitting his final report as special counsel. (AFP)

    Impeachment trial of S Korean President Yoon begins

<div class="itemFullText">
 The impeachment trial of suspended South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol began on Tuesday, with the country's Constitutional Court deciding whether to strip him of his duties over a failed martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It has started," the Constitutional Court's spokesperson told international media, adding that the first hearing -- out of a confirmed five -- ended minutes later with Yoon not in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The following sessions will take place on January 16, 21, 23 and February 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's December 3 power grab plunged South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his suspension of civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was impeached soon after and suspended from duty, but has gone to ground in his residence since, refusing summonses from investigators probing him on insurrection charges and using his presidential security team to resist arrest. (AFP)

    N Korea performs its second missile test of the year

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea on Tuesday test-fired multiple missiles toward its eastern waters, South Korea’s military said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the short-range ballistic missiles were fired from a northern inland area and flew about 250 kilometres before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint chiefs said the South Korean military had strengthened surveillance while sharing the launch information with the US and Japanese militaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it strongly condemns the test, describing it as a “clear provocation" that poses a serious threat to the region's peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was North Korea’s second launch event of 2025, following a ballistic launch last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea said the January 6 test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong-un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea is coming off a torrid year in weapons testing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The systems it demonstrated in 2024 included solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to strike the US mainland and various shorter-range missiles designed to overwhelm missile defences in South Korea. (AP)

<img alt="CES 2025 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787411_1_20250114100720.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Everything from autonomous snow blowers to humanoid robots filled the show floors at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Considered the World Cup of technology, the world's largest personal electronics convention wrapped up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Making their tech presence felt at the four-day event were nearly 100 registered companies from Hong Kong, more than half supported by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP).
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this year, we bring 51 companies from Hong Kong... it's actually a huge growth compared to last year. Last year we have about 18," says Derek Chim, Head of Startup Ecosystem at HKSTP.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSTP-supported companies brought in three CES Innovation Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those, Vidi Labs, demonstrated how their wearable device - with AI-driven software - could describe the surrounding environment for a visually-impaired user.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This actually proves a lot that the route that we are on is actually the right one, because a product like this not only is for Hong Kong, it's actually for the rest of the world," said Turzo Bose, co-founder & CEO of Vidi Labs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the Hong Kong Pavilion, South Korean Minji Seo - who earned her PhD in Hong Kong - displays technology that rejuvenates your eyeballs with hot yoga therapy. It's intended to help people with dry eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We create a vacuum seal, using the silicone band around the goggle, and that's the chamber that we are controlling the temperature and pressure. Our main goal to join this event was to, like, verify whether we have a market here. And we definitely verified it," said Seo, founder of Ooley Care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong exhibitor, Michael Wong - a veteran of the Hong Kong hair care industry - uses a scanner to take images of your hair and scalp, and provide an analysis and recommendation for the right shampoo, conditioner and treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We use over millions of pictures to train our AI models so that's why it's accurate, over 90 percent. So everything just can do it within three minutes. So every American has their hair growth again, said Wong, founder and CEO of HairCoSys.
  <br>
  <br>
  His showmanship helps his startup, HairCoSys, stand out among the more than 4,500 exhibitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But so do products with unique compositions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fever Chu, co-founder of Zence Object Technology, displays everything from a TV remote that integrates recycled tea leaves, to a calculator frame composed of coffee grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are using their waste and turn it into new material and give back to them. Somehow we can help them to promote their waste product, the material, to the bigger market," said Chu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says their products have drawn plenty of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last night... over 60 [emails] within two days to the potential clients."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says he has already heard back from many of them, confirming his belief that companies around the world want a greener supply chain.

    Biden says Gaza ceasefire deal 'on the brink'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Monday that a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Hamas and Israel is "on the brink" of being finalised, amid growing optimism in Washington about negotiations in the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In the war between Israel and Hamas, we're on the brink of a proposal that I laid out in detail months ago finally coming to fruition," Biden said in a farewell speech at the State Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has been working the phones as he seeks a prized peace deal in his final days in office before Donald Trump returns to the White House on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the proposed agreement would include a surge of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the release of hostages held by Hamas and a halt to the fighting in the enclave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're working urgently to close this deal," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outgoing US president said he would be speaking soon to Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has played a key role in negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday and called the ruler of mediator Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A peace deal has seemed within reach on a number of previous occasions since the Gaza war broke out following Hamas's October 6, 2023 attack on Israel, only then to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  But optimism is growing in Washington that an agreement is possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said earlier Monday as that a truce was "close."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are close to a deal, and it can get done this week," Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not making a promise or prediction, but it is there for the taking, and we are going to work to make it happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sullivan said the "gaps have fundamentally narrowed down" between Israel and Hamas. (AFP)

 A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 has hit south-western Japan, the country's meteorological agency said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tsunami warnings were issued for Miyazaki Prefecture, where the temblor was centred, in the southwestern island of Kyushu, as well as nearby Kochi Prefecture, shortly after the quake struck at 9.19pm local time, according to the agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tsunami can strike repeatedly. Please do not enter the sea or go near coastal areas," the agency said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extent of damage was not immediately clear. (AP/AFP)

    Blue Origin pushes back launch of giant new rocket

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin will have to wait a little longer for the long-anticipated maiden orbital flight of its brand-new rocket after a launch attempt dragged on for hours before being canceled due to unspecified technical issues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The towering 98-metre rocket, dubbed New Glenn in honor of legendary astronaut John Glenn, was scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station during a three-hour window starting at 1am (0600 GMT) on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the countdown repeatedly stalled as teams scrambled to resolve anomalies, before the mission was officially "scrubbed" around 3.10am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are standing down today's launch attempt to troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue that will take us beyond our launch window," said Ariane Cornell, a Blue Origin executive, during a livestream watched by hundreds of thousands of viewers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cornell added: "We are reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the mission, dubbed NG-1, billionaire Amazon founder Bezos is taking aim at the only man in the world wealthier than him: Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its prolific Falcon 9 rockets, vital for the commercial sector, the Pentagon and Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bezos, who celebrated his 61st birthday on Sunday, watched the events unfold from the nearby launch control room.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, for his part, wished Blue Origin "Good luck!" on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town, and so having a competitor... this is great," G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior Nasa official, told AFP, expecting the competition to drive down costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX, meanwhile, is planning the next orbital test of Starship -- its gargantuan new-generation rocket -- this week, upping the high-stakes rivalry. (AFP)

    SKorea to adapt airport barriers after plane crash

<img alt="Officials inspect the instrument landing system localiser area at the site where a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 aircraft crashed on December 29.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities on Monday said they would change the concrete barriers used for navigation at airports around the country after the Jeju Air crash that left 179 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 was flying from Thailand to Muan, South Korea, on December 29 carrying 181 passengers and crew when it belly-landed at Muan airport and exploded in a fireball after slamming into a concrete barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the worst-ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improvement was deemed necessary including the localiser and its foundations for a total of nine facilities across seven airports, including Muan airport," the land ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes would also apply to international airports in the cities of Jeju and Gimhae.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators are still probing the cause of the crash, which prompted a national outpouring of mourning with memorials set up across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attention has focused on several possible causes but questions have been raised about why the concrete barricade, known as a localiser and used to help planes navigate their landings, was at the end of the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The barrier at Muan airport was blamed for exacerbating the crash's severity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said it would finalise plans to adapt the localisers by the end of January, with the aim of "completing upgrades within this year".
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation was further clouded on Saturday when the transport ministry said the black boxes holding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders for the crashed flight stopped recording four minutes before the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have raided offices at Muan airport, a regional aviation office in the southwestern county, and Jeju Air's office in the capital Seoul as the probe continues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The land ministry added that Muan airport's closure period had been extended until January 19. (AFP)

    Seoul says 300 NKorean soldiers killed in Ukraine

<img alt="A photograph shows an alleged North Korean soldier detained by Ukrainian authorities at an undisclosed location in Ukraine. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787299_1_20250113153440.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Around 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and 2,700 wounded while fighting for Russia, a South Korean lawmaker said Monday, citing information from Seoul's spy agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Seoul has previously claimed that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sent more than 10,000 soldiers to fight in the Ukraine conflict, in return for Russian technical assistance for Pyongyang's heavily sanctioned weapons and satellite programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv had captured two North Korean soldiers, releasing video of the injured combatants being interrogated and raising the possibility of a prisoner swap for captured Ukrainian troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deployment of North Korean troops to Russia has reportedly expanded to include the Kursk region, with estimates suggesting that casualties among North Korean forces have surpassed 3,000," lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters after a briefing from the spy agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  This includes "approximately 300 deaths and 2,700 injuries," Lee said, after a briefing from Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS).
  <br>
  <br>
  The soldiers, reportedly from North Korea's elite Storm Corps, have been ordered to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Notably, memos found on deceased soldiers indicate that the North Korean authorities pressured them to commit suicide or self-detonate before capture," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some of the soldiers had been granted "amnesty" or wanted to join North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, hoping to improve their lot by fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NIS analysis also revealed that the North Korean soldiers have "a lack of understanding of modern warfare," and are being used by Russia in a manner leading to "the high number of casualties," the lawmaker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee -- speaking for South Korea's intelligence committee in parliament -- said in the coming year, US president-elect Donald Trump, who has previously tried to woo North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, "may push for dialogue... once again".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Kim may "weigh the possibility of a visit to Russia in the first half of this year" after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on the social media platform X on Sunday, Zelensky said: "Ukraine is ready to hand over Kim Jong-un's soldiers to him if he can organise their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  There would "undoubtedly be more" North Korean soldiers captured by Kyiv, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, there may be other options available," said Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has acknowledged that North Koreans have been deployed to fight. (AFP)

    400mil pilgrims gather for giant Hindu festival

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vast crowds of Hindu pilgrims in India began bathing in sacred waters on Monday as the Kumbh Mela festival opened, with organisers expecting 400 million people -- the largest gathering of humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The millennia-old Kumbh Mela, a show of religious piety and ritual bathing -- and a logistical challenge of staggering proportions -- is held at the site where the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the cool pre-dawn gloom, pilgrims surged forward to begin bathing in the waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great joy," said Surmila Devi, 45.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it's like bathing in nectar."
  <br>
  <br>
  Businesswoman Reena Rai's voice quivered with excitement as she spoke about the "religious reasons" that brought her to join the sprawling tents, packed along the river banks in the north Indian city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh state.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a Hindu, this is an unmissable occasion," said the 38-year-old, who travelled around 1,000 kilometres from Madhya Pradesh state to take part in the festival, which runs from Monday until February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saffron-robed monks and naked ash-smeared ascetics roamed the crowds offering blessings to devotees, many of whom had walked for weeks to reach the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The massive congregation is also an occasion for India's Hindu nationalist government to burnish its credentials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it a "divine occasion", that brings together "countless people in a sacred confluence of faith, devotion and culture".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu monk and Utter Pradesh's chief minister, welcomed devotees to "experience unity in diversity" at the "world's largest spiritual and cultural gathering".
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers say the scale of the Kumbh Mela is that of a temporary country -- with numbers expected to total around the combined populations of the United States and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some 350 to 400 million devotees are going to visit the mela, so you can imagine the scale of preparations," festival spokesman Vivek Chaturvedi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hindu monks carried huge flags of their respective sects, while tractors turned into chariots for life-size idols of Hindu gods rolled by behind them accompanied by elephants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pilgrims exulted in the beat of drums and honking horns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival is rooted in Hindu mythology, a battle between deities and demons for control of a pitcher containing the nectar of immortality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organising authorities are calling it the great or "Maha" Kumbh Mela. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from massive wildfires that have ravaged Los Angeles rose to 24 on Sunday, with officials warning of incoming dangerous winds that could whip the blazes up further.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fires continued to rip through the United States' second-largest city for the sixth day, reducing whole communities to scorched rubble and leaving thousands without homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Massive firefighting efforts have staunched the spread of the Palisades Fire, which was looming toward upscale Brentwood and the densely populated San Fernando Valley.
  <br>
  <br>
  But conditions are set to dramatically worsen, with "extreme fire behavior and life threatening conditions" over the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds up to 110 kilometers per hour mean a "particularly dangerous situation (PDS)" will be declared from early Tuesday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld.
  <br>
  <br>
  These gusts could fan flames and whip up embers from existing burn zones into new areas, firefighters warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles County Fire Department chief Anthony Marrone said his department had received resources including dozens of new water trucks and firefighters from far afield and was primed to face the renewed threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questioned whether hydrants could run dry again, as they did during the initial outbreak of fires last week, Mayor Karen Bass replied: "I believe the city is prepared." (AFP)

<img alt="The suspended South Korean president has been holed up in the presidential residence since his short-lived declaration of martial law. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787171_1_20250112144935.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk-yeol will not attend the first hearing of his impeachment trial next week because of safety concerns, his lawyer said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has been holed up in the presidential residence and protected by an elite guard force since being suspended and impeached last month, following a short-lived declaration of martial law that plunged the country into political chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has refused to meet prosecutors and investigators and his presidential guard unit thwarted an attempt to arrest him following a tense, hours-long standoff earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court has scheduled five trial dates spanning January 14 to February 4, which will proceed in his absence if he does not attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Concerns about safety and potential incidents have arisen. Therefore, the President will not be able to attend the trial on January 14," lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said in a statement sent to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The President is willing to appear at any time once safety issues are resolved."
  <br>
  <br>
  The court will decide whether to uphold his impeachment or restore him to office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, investigators seeking to question Yoon on insurrection charges linked to his ill-fated martial law declaration are preparing another arrest attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyers have repeatedly said an initial seven-day warrant and the new one they secured this week were both "unlawful".
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have kept secret the length of the new warrant, with local media reports saying it is longer than the previous seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rival protesters for and against Yoon have gathered almost daily in the South Korean capital since the crisis unfolded.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday more demonstrations were planned by rival camps outside Yoon's residence and on the streets of Seoul -- either calling for his impeachment to be declared invalid or for him to be detained immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's legal team say his guards remain on "high alert".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon would become the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested if investigators are able to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  If convicted, he faces prison or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A team of Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) officials and police are planning for the next attempt, which they said could be their last.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CIO said anyone obstructing their attempt could be detained themselves and police reportedly held a meeting of top commanders on Friday to plan for the renewed effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Presidential Security Service (PSS) chief Park Chong-jun -- who resigned on Friday and was automatically replaced by a more hardline Yoon loyalist -- told reporters there must be no bloodshed in any second arrest attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He faced two days of questioning and did not explain his resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am cooperating as diligently as possible with the authorities' investigation," he told reporters Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  His replacement, acting PSS chief Kim Seong-hun, refused to turn up to a third summons on Saturday claiming he had to protect Yoon, opening him up to possible arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jin-ha, head of the service's security and safety division, was questioned on Saturday.

  The National Office of Investigation, a police unit, sent a note to high-ranking police officials in Seoul requesting they prepare to mobilise 1,000 investigators for the fresh attempt, the Yonhap news agency reported.

  As the crisis goes on Yoon's ruling party has seen a bump in approval ratings.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli air strike on a school-turned-shelter on Saturday killed eight people, including two children, while the Israeli military said it targeted Hamas militants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal confirmed eight people, including two children and two women, were killed by Israeli shelling on the Halwa school in the northern Gaza city of Jabalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bassal said the strike wounded 30 people, including 19 children, and that the Halwa school housed "thousands of displaced people."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military, in a statement, acknowledged it conducted a strike on the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the air force "conducted a precise strike on terrorists in a command-and-control centre" that had previously served as the Halwa school in Jabalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it targeted the premises because "the school had been used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack was the latest in a series of Israeli strikes on school buildings housing displaced people in Gaza, where fighting has raged for more than 14 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  A strike on the United Nations-run Al-Jawni school in central Gaza on September 11 drew an international outcry after the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said six of its staff were among the 18 reported dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military accuses Hamas of hiding in school buildings where thousands of Gazans have sought shelter – a charge denied by the Palestinian militant group.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 46,537 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's military campaign in Gaza since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry. The United Nations has acknowledged these figures as reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 7 attack that triggered it resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people on the Israeli side, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity. (AFP)

    Los Angeles investigates fire blame as curfew enforced

<img alt="Abandoned cars sit on Sunset Boulevard following the Palisades Fire. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787121_1_20250111210945.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Californians on Friday demanded to know who is at fault for the vast devastation caused by the raging Los Angeles wildfires, as a strict curfew went into force to prevent looting and lawlessness.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 11 people died as flames ripped through neighbourhoods and razed thousands of homes in a disaster that US President Joe Biden likened to a "war scene."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Angelenos grapple with the heart-rending ruin, anger has risen over officials' preparedness and response, particularly for a series of false evacuation alarms and after fire hydrants ran dry as firefighters battled the initial blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday ordered a "full independent review" of the city's utilities, describing the lack of water supplies during the initial fires as "deeply troubling."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need answers to how that happened," he wrote in an open letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents like Nicole Perri, whose home in the upscale Pacific Palisades burnt down, said that officials had "completely let us down."
  <br>
  <br>
  "They let us, the ordinary people, burn," added Nicholas Norman, across the city in Altadena.
  <br>
  <br>
  A flare-up late on Friday prompted new mandatory evacuations from ritzy neighbourhoods along the fire's eastern flank, which include the famous Getty Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  Built at a cost of US$1 billion and constructed partly of fire-resistant travertine stone, the acclaimed museum boasts 125,000 artworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, as fears of looting grow, a sunset-to-sunrise curfew took effect in evacuated areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around two dozen arrests have already been made across Los Angeles, where some residents have organised street patrols and kept armed watch over their own houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we see you in these areas, you will be subject to arrest," Los Angeles Police Department chief Jim McDonnell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violators face up to six months in prison or US$1,000 fines, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Guard has been deployed to bolster law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five separate fires have so far burned more than 37,000 acres (15,000 hectares), destroying around 10,000 buildings, California's fire agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office confirmed an additional fatality on Friday, bringing the overall death toll so far to 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It reminded me of more of a war scene, where you had certain targets that were bombarded," said Biden, as he received a briefing on the fires at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds calmed on Friday, providing a much-needed if fleeting window of opportunity for firefighters battling blazes around the clock for a fourth consecutive day.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the biggest of the blazes, in Pacific Palisades and Malibu, firefighters said they were starting to get the fire under control, with eight percent of its perimeter contained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Braveheart" actor Mel Gibson was the latest celebrity to reveal his Malibu home had burned down, telling NewsNation the loss was "devastating."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Eaton Fire in the Altadena area was three percent contained, with fire chief Jason Schillinger reporting "significant progress" in quelling the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third fire that exploded on Thursday afternoon near the wealthy Hidden Hills enclave, home to celebrities like Kim Kardashian, was 50 percent surrounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  But emergency chiefs warned the situation is "still very dangerous" and reprieve from the intense gusts that spread embers will not last.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The winds have died down today, but... are going to increase again in the coming days," said Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have said it was too early to know the cause of the blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden took a veiled swipe at incoming president Donald Trump, who has spread misinformation over the flames that has then been amplified on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You're going to have a lot of demagogues out there trying to take advantage of it," Biden said of the fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Governor Newsom, who has been blamed for the disaster by the president-elect, invited Trump to visit Los Angeles and survey the devastation with him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the spirit of this great country, we must not politicise human tragedy or spread disinformation from the sidelines," said Newsom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wildfires occur naturally, but scientists say human-caused climate change is altering weather and changing the dynamics of the blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two wet years in southern California have given way to a very dry one, leaving ample fuel on the ground primed to burn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency managers apologised on Friday after false evacuation alerts were erroneously sent to millions of mobile phones, sparking panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't express enough how sorry I am," said Kevin McGowan, the director of the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles fire chief Kristin Crowley blamed recent funding cuts, telling Fox News affiliate KTTV her department was chronically "understaffed" and "under-resourced." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 3,000 flights were cancelled on Friday and thousands more were hit by delays due to a storm in the southern United States, airlines and tracking website FlightAware reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delta Airlines said a "worse-than-expected mix of winter weather" prompted the shutdown of all five runways at Atlanta International Airport for more than two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Delta cancelled approximately 1,100 flights across our network" on Friday, the carrier said as it was "working to recover the airline heading into Saturday."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Delta plane also had to abort take-off at Atlanta because of an engine problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 passengers and crew aboard the Boeing 757-300 had to exit via emergency slides, US media reported citing a company statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas Fort Worth (Texas) and Charlotte Douglas (North Carolina) were also affected by the bad weather, with more than 1,200 flights cancelled across the two airports according to FlightAware.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tracking website recorded more than 3,000 cancellations in total on Friday across multiple airports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States was already hit by a winter storm at the start of the week, leaving at least five people dead and prompting hundreds of flights to be scrapped as it swept across the centre and east of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temperatures plummeted below zero degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) in some places and tens of thousands of people were left without electricity. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as “Soul Man” and “Hold On, I'm Comin,’” has died. He was 89.
 <br>
  <br>
  Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died on Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like many ’60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But “Soul Man” hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the “Saturday Night Live” stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers. (AP)

    Jeju Air black boxes stopped recording before crash

<img alt="Investigators say the boxes are crucial to their probe but added they would not give up on trying to find out why the crash happened.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The black boxes holding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders for the crashed Jeju Air flight that left 179 people dead stopped recording four minutes before the disaster, South Korea's transport ministry said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 was flying from Thailand to Muan, South Korea, on December 29 carrying 181 passengers and crew when it belly-landed at the Muan airport and exploded in a fireball after slamming into a concrete barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The analysis revealed that both the CVR and FDR data were not recorded during the four minutes leading up to the aircraft's collision with the localiser," the transport ministry said in a statement, referring to the two recording devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The localiser is a barrier at the end of the runway that helps with aircraft landings and was blamed for exacerbating the crash's severity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Plans are in place to investigate the cause of the data loss during the ongoing accident investigation," the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators are still probing the cause of the crash of Jeju Air flight 2216, which prompted a national outpouring of mourning with memorials set up across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have pointed to a bird strike, faulty landing gear and the runway barrier as possible issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilot warned of a bird strike before pulling out of a first landing, then crashed on a second attempt when the landing gear did not emerge. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Lakers coach J.J. Redick says he hopes the team's eventual return to play can "give people hope" after seeing his Pacific Palisades home incinerated in the deadly wildfires that have ravaged the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers postponed a scheduled home game against Charlotte on Thursday because of the fires, which have left at least 11 people dead and destroyed around 10,000 homes and other buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick oversaw practice on Friday for what was expected to be an emotionally charged home game against the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday, but that game too was postponed in a decision announced by NBA league chiefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers' game against Charlotte set for Saturday was also postponed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick is one of several members of the Lakers organization directly impacted by the fires, seeing his family's rented property in Pacific Palisades, the ground zero of the disaster, consumed by the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Redick became emotional as he spoke to reporters about the personal impact of the disaster on his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not sure I've wept or wailed like that in several years," said Redick, who was living in the house with his wife, Chelsea, and their two sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was not prepared for what I saw," Redick said of visiting Pacific Palisades after returning home from the Lakers' road game at Dallas in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  By that stage, Redick's family had been evacuated to a hotel. The Lakers coach then paid a visit to his home early on Wednesday to assess the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was complete devastation and destruction. I went a different way to the house through the village, and it's all gone," Redick said. "I don't think you can ever prepare yourself for something like that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick said his family had lost "irreplaceable" items in the destruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything that we owned that was of any importance to us in almost 20 years together as a couple and 10 years of parenting was in that house." (AFP)

    Biden slams Meta's "shameful" fact-checking decision

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Biden blasted Meta on Friday for scrapping fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram in the United States, calling the move "really shameful" after a global network warned of real-world harm if the tech giant expands its decision to other countries.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg triggered alarm on Tuesday when he announced the company was ditching third-party fact-checking in the United States and turning over the task of debunking falsehoods to ordinary users under a model known as "Community Notes," popularized by X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision was widely seen as an attempt to appease President-elect Donald Trump, whose conservative support base has long complained that fact-checking on tech platforms was a way to curtail free speech and censor right-wing content.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's really shameful," Biden told reporters at the White House when asked about the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Telling the truth matters," he said, adding that the move was "completely contrary to everything America's about."
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Fact-Checking Network has warned of devastating consequences if Meta broadens its policy shift beyond US borders to the company's programs covering more than 100 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of these countries are highly vulnerable to misinformation that spurs political instability, election interference, mob violence and even genocide," IFCN, which includes AFP among dozens of its global member organizations, said in an open letter to Zuckerberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Meta decides to stop the programme worldwide, it is almost certain to result in real-world harm in many places," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zuckerberg doubled down in an interview Friday with podcaster Joe Rogan, comparing the fact-checking programme with "something out of 1984," in a reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the programme, which began in 2016, was "destroying so much trust, especially in the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zuckerberg also expressed regret for giving "too much deference" to the traditional media, criticizing it for pushing the narrative that social media misinformation had swung the 2016 election in favour of Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zuckerberg stunned many when he said on Tuesday that fact-checkers were "too politically biased," and added that the programme had led to "too much censorship."
  <br>
  <br>
  IFCN's letter rejected the claim as "false," insisting that Meta's fact-checking partners underwent "rigorous" verification to meet its strict nonpartisanship standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Far from questioning those standards, it added, Meta had "consistently praised their rigour and effectiveness."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations rights chief Volker Turk also insisted on Friday that regulating harmful content and hate speech online "is not censorship."
  <br>
  <br>
  Allowing such content to flourish online has "real-world consequences," Turk said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil on Friday gave Meta 72 hours to explain its fact-checking policy for the country, and how it plans to protect "fundamental rights" on its platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attorney General Jorge Messias told journalists his office could take "legal and judicial" measures against Meta if it does not respond in time to an extrajudicial notice filed Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Facebook currently pays to use fact checks from around 80 organizations globally on the platform, as well as on WhatsApp and Instagram. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An estimated 3.2 million children under the age of five are expected to face acute malnutrition this year in war-torn Sudan, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef).
 <br>
  <br>
  "Of this number, around 772,000 children are expected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition," Eva Hinds, Unicef Sudan's Head of Advocacy and Communication, said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Famine has already gripped five areas across Sudan, according to a report last month by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-backed assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sudan has endured 20 months of war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), killing tens of thousands and, according to the United Nations, uprooting 12 million in the world's largest displacement crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirming that 3.2 million children are currently expected to face acute malnutrition, Hinds said "The number of severely malnourished children increased from an estimated 730,000 in 2024 to over 770,000 in 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  The IPC expects famine to expand to five more parts of Sudan's western Darfur region by May – a vast area that has seen some of the conflict's worst violence. A further 17 areas in western and central Sudan are also at risk of famine, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without immediate, unhindered humanitarian access facilitating a significant scale-up of a multisectoral response, malnutrition is likely to increase in these areas," Hinds warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sudan's army-aligned government strongly rejected the IPC findings, while aid agencies complain that access is blocked by bureaucratic hurdles and ongoing violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council accused both sides of using "starvation tactics."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday the United States determined that the RSF had "committed genocide" and imposed sanctions on the paramilitary group's leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Across the country, more than 24.6 million people – around half the population – face "high levels of acute food insecurity," according to the IPC, which said: "Only a ceasefire can reduce the risk of famine spreading further." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Treasury chief is travelling to China this weekend to discuss economic and financial cooperation between the countries, as the UK's Labour government seeks to reset ties with Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Treasury on Friday said that Rachel Reeves would travel to Beijing and Shanghai and would meet with her counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves' trip is expected to revive the China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue — annual bilateral talks that have been suspended since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and the UK Financial Conduct Authority's chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, are also in the delegation, according to the Treasury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Representatives from some of Britain’s biggest financial services firms will join the trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials did not provide details, but media reports have said senior executives from HSBC Holdings and Standard Chartered were included.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves' visit comes after Foreign Secretary David Lammy travelled to China in October and Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meetings form part of a bid by Starmer, who was elected as leader in July, to strengthen political and economic ties with China, the UK's fifth-largest trading partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said Starmer wanted a “pragmatic” approach to working with Beijing on global stability, climate change and the transition to clean energy. (AP)

    At least 10 dead in LA wildfires

<div class="itemFullText">
 The two biggest wildfires ravaging the Los Angeles area have killed at least 10 people and burned more than 10,000 homes and other structures, officials said as they urged more people to heed evacuation orders after a new blaze ignited and quickly grew.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kenneth Fire started late on Thursday afternoon in the San Fernando Valley just 3.2 kilometres from a school serving as a shelter for evacuees from another fire. It moved into neighbouring Ventura County but a large and aggressive response by firefighters stopped the flames from spreading.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 400 firefighters remained on scene overnight to guard against the fire flaring up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only hours before the Kenneth Fire roared to life officials expressed encouragement after firefighters aided by calmer winds and help from crews from outside the state saw the first signs of successfully beating back the region’s two devastating wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eaton Fire near Pasadena that started on Tuesday night has burned more than 5,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters were able to establish the first bit of containment on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  To the west in Pacific Palisades, the largest of the fires burning in the LA area has destroyed over 5,300 structures and firefighters had no containment.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the major fires that have broken out this week are located in a roughly 40-kilometre band north of downtown Los Angeles, spreading a sense of fear and sadness across the nation’s second-largest city.
  <br>
  <br>
  No cause has been identified for the largest fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The level of devastation is jarring even in a state that has grown used to massive wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  A large portion of scenic Pacific Palisades has been obliterated. Dozens of blocks in the seaside neighbourhood were flattened to smouldering rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring Malibu, blackened palm strands were all that was left above debris where ocean-front homes once stood. (AP)

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday a meeting was being set up between him and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Image: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786932_1_20250110123847.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said that Russian leader Vladimir Putin wanted to meet and that a rendezvous between the pair was being arranged.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the statement just a week and a half before taking office, following promises during his campaign to bring peace to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He wants to meet, and we're setting it up," Trump said at a meeting with Republican governors at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Putin wants to meet, he's said that even publicly, and we have to get that war over with, that's a bloody mess."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has never made any concrete proposals for a ceasefire or peace deal, and has often criticised the large amount of military aid the United States has sent to Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also frequently mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a "salesman," while raising eyebrows in Washington by rarely criticising Putin -- and even speaking admiringly of the Kremlin leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to criticising the military aid sent to Ukraine under President Joe Biden, Trump has raised doubts over continued US involvement in the Western military alliance Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States under Biden has been Ukraine's biggest wartime backer, providing military aid worth more than US$65 billion since February 2022. (AFP)

<img alt="A firefighter battles the wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Scientists warn that natural disasters like the LA fires will intensify as the world continues to warm. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786929_1_20250110122421.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The planet notched up its hottest year ever last year with such a big jump that it temporarily passed a major climate threshold, several weather monitoring agencies announced Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year's global average temperature easily passed 2023's record heat and kept pushing even higher. It surpassed the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  The milestone was confirmed by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), which said climate change is pushing the planet's temperature to levels never before experienced by modern humans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trajectory is just incredible," C3S director Carlo Buontempo told Reuters, describing how every month in 2024 was the warmest or second-warmest for that month since records began.
  <br>
  <br>
  The planet's average temperature in 2024 was 1.6 degrees Celsius higher than in 1850-1900, the "pre-industrial period" before humans began burning CO2-emitting fossil fuels on a large scale, C3S said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year was the world's hottest since records began, and each of the past 10 years was among the 10 warmest on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Met Office confirmed 2024's likely breach of 1.5C, while estimating a slightly lower average temperature of 1.53C for the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan recorded a 1.57C average while the American monitoring teams — Nasa, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the private Berkeley Earth — were to release their figures later Friday but all will likely show record heat for 2024, European scientists said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six groups compensate for data gaps in observations that go back to 1850, in different ways, which is why numbers vary slightly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Governments promised under the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to prevent average temperatures exceeding 1.5C, to avoid more severe and costly climate disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first year above 1.5C does not breach that target, which measures the longer-term average temperature.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buontempo said rising greenhouse gas emissions meant the world was on track to soon also blow past the Paris goal - but that it was not too late for countries to rapidly cut emissions to avoid warming rising further to disastrous levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not a done deal. We have the power to change the trajectory from now on," Buontempo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The impacts of climate change are now visible on every continent, affecting people from the richest to the poorest countries on earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wildfires raging in California this week have killed at least five people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, Bolivia and Venezuela also suffered disastrous fires, while torrential floods hit Nepal, Sudan and Spain, and heatwaves in Mexico and Saudi Arabia killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate change is worsening storms and torrential rainfall, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more water, leading to intense downpours. The amount of water vapour in the planet's atmosphere reached a record high in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even as the costs of these disasters spiral, political will to invest in curbing emissions has waned in some countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on January 20, has called climate change a hoax, despite the global scientific consensus that it is human-caused and will have severe consequences if not addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US experienced 24 climate and weather disasters in 2024 in which the cost of damages exceeded US$1 billion, including Hurricanes Milton and Helene, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chukwumerije Okereke, a professor of global climate governance at the University of Bristol in the UK, said the 1.5C milestone should serve as "a rude awakening to key political actors to get their act together".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite all the warnings that scientists have given, nations... are continuing to fail to live up to their responsibilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Concentrations in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, reached a fresh high of 422 parts per million in 2024, C3S said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at US non-profit Berkeley Earth, said he expected 2025 to be among the hottest years on record, but likely not top the rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's still going to be in the top three warmest years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's because while the biggest factor warming the climate is human-caused emissions, temperatures in early 2024 got an extra boost from El Nino, a warming weather pattern which is now trending towards its cooler La Nina counterpart. (Agencies)

    Yoon's presidential security chief urges no bloodshed

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The security chief of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Friday that he had been unfairly treated for a sitting leader and warned bloodshed must be avoided.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon faces arrest over a criminal probe into his December 3 martial law bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Park Chong-jun, head of the Presidential Security Service (PSS), is himself under investigation for obstructing official duty related to a six-hour standoff last week with investigators trying to execute an arrest warrant for Yoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arriving at police headquarters for questioning, Park, who is a former senior police official, said the current attempt to arrest a sitting president was wrong and Yoon deserved treatment "becoming of" the country's status.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe there should not be any physical clash or bloodshed under any circumstances," Park told reporters, adding acting President Choi Sang-mok had not responded to his request for safety assurances for officials involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of PSS agents blockaded the presidential compound and thwarted investigators from trying to arrest Yoon. The investigators were pulled back because of the risk of a clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials of the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), which is leading the investigation, have said PSS agents were carrying firearms during the standoff although no weapons were drawn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigators obtained a new arrest warrant this week after the embattled leader defied repeated summons to appear for questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, lawyers for Yoon said the arrest warrant was illegal and invalid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is under a separate Constitutional Court trial reviewing parliament's impeachment of the suspended leader on December 14 to decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jimmy Carter brought a fleeting moment of national unity to a divided America on Thursday as all five living US presidents gathered for their predecessor's moving state funeral in Washington's National Cathedral.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the rare gathering just days before Donald Trump's return to the White House, sitting President Joe Biden gave a eulogy describing "character" as fellow Democrat Carter's main attribute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump shook hands with former president Barack Obama on the country's day of mourning, while Bill Clinton and George W Bush were also there to pay their respects.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Biden, 82, also appeared to deliver a veiled swipe at Trump, the Republican whose racially-charged rhetoric and efforts to overturn the 2020 election he has often criticised as threats to democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have an obligation to give hate no safe harbour," said Biden, also stressing the importance standing up against "the greatest sin of all, the abuse of power."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the speech, Biden briefly tapped the flag-draped coffin of Carter, America's 39th commander-in-chief, who died on December 29 at the age of 100 in his native Georgia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The presidential funeral was the first since George H W Bush died in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the service, family members and former political adversaries alike paid emotional tributes to Carter, the oldest-ever former US president and the only one to make it to three figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter's coffin was earlier transported by an honour guard from the US Capitol, where thousands of mourners had paid their respects as the former president lay in state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday has been designated a national day of mourning in the United States with federal offices closed. (AFP)

    Trump denied bid to halt hush money sentencing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court on Thursday denied a last-minute bid by President-elect Donald Trump to halt sentencing in his hush money case.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top court, which includes three justices appointed by Trump, rejected his emergency application seeking to block Friday's sentencing by a 5-4 vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court, in a brief unsigned order, said the "burden that sentencing will impose on the President-elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial" and noted that Trump will be allowed to attend virtually.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court also noted that the judge who presided over the hush money case has already said he plans to impose a sentence of "unconditional discharge," which does not carry any jail time, fine or probation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is scheduled to be sentenced in Manhattan at 9:30 am local time on Friday after being convicted by a New York jury in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, who is to be sworn in as president on January 20, filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking to halt his sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, all conservatives - were in favour of granting Trump's request to halt his sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, also conservatives, joined the three liberal justices in rejecting the president-elect's bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrett, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were appointed by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's lawyers made several legal manoeuvres in an effort to fend off sentencing, arguing that it would be a "grave injustice" and harm "the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's attorneys also claimed that the immunity from prosecution granted to a sitting president should be extended to a president-elect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg rejected their arguments in his response on Thursday, saying Trump was a private citizen when he was "charged, tried, and convicted."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the order, the Supreme Court said Trump can still appeal his conviction through the New York state courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is the first former US president to be convicted of a crime and will be the first convicted felon to serve in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a federal appeals court on Thursday declined to block the Justice Department from releasing a report on Trump, which is expected to detail investigations conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith over attempts to subvert the 2020 presidential election results and for mishandling classified documents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pair of massive wildfires menacing Los Angeles from the east and west were still burning uncontained on Thursday, two days after they ignited, but firefighters managed to beat back another blaze scorching the Hollywood Hills.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Palisades fire between Santa Monica and Malibu on the city's western flank and the Eaton Fire in the east near Pasadena are already the most destructive in Los Angeles history, turning entire neighbourhoods to ash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swathes of the United States' second-largest city lay in ruins, with smoke blanketing the sky and an acrid smell pervading almost every building.
  <br>
  <br>

   <br>
   At least five people have been killed, thousands of structures have been incinerated and nearly 180,000 people have been ordered to evacuate their homes, officials said.
   <br>
   <br>
   Among those who died was 66-year-old Victor Shaw, whose sister said he had ignored pleas to leave as the fire swept through Altadena because he wanted to protect their home.
   <br>
   <br>
   "When I went back in and yelled out his name, he didn't reply," Shari Shaw said.
   <br>
   <br>
   "I had to get out because the embers were so big and flying like a firestorm that I had to save myself."
   <br>
   <br>
   Shaw's body was found by a friend on the driveway of his razed home, a garden hose in his hand.
   <br>
   <br>
   The two biggest conflagrations - the Palisades and Eaton fires - formed a pincer around the city so enormous that it was visible from space.

    <br>
    The homes of movie stars and celebrities were among those consumed by flames, which tore through some of the world's most lavish real estate.
    <br>
    <br>
    "We are heartbroken of course, but with the love of children and friends we will get through this," said film star Billy Crystal and his wife Janice, announcing that the Pacific Palisades home where they had lived since 1979 had been destroyed.
    <br>
    <br>
    Media personality Paris Hilton said she was "heartbroken beyond words" after watching her beachfront house in Malibu "burn to the ground on live TV."
    <br>
    <br>
    The fires struck at an especially vulnerable time for Southern California, which has not seen significant rainfall for months. Then came the powerful Santa Ana winds, bringing dry desert air from the east toward the coastal mountains, fanning wildfires while blowing over the hilltops and down through the canyons.
    <br>
    <br>
    Wind gusts were expected to strengthen on Thursday evening through to Friday morning, with another round of strong winds expected early next week, raising concerns that the conditions could worsen, the National Weather Service said.
    <br>
    <br>
    At least 20 arrests have been made for looting, and the city of Santa Monica declared a curfew on Wednesday night because of the lawlessness, officials said.
    <br>
    <br>
    Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said to protect properties, national guard troops would be stationed near the areas ravaged by fire and a curfew was expected to go into effect from 6 pm until 6 am, starting as soon as Thursday. (Agencies)

    US greenhouse gas emissions fell only 0.2% in 2024

<img alt="The report by the Rhodium Group, an independent research organization, found a net fall of just 0.2 percent in economy-wide emissions. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786852_1_20250109212051.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US greenhouse gas emissions barely decreased in 2024, leaving the world's largest economy off track to achieve its climate goals, according to an analysis released Thursday, as the incoming Trump administration looks set to double down on fossil fuels.
 <br>
  <br>
  The preliminary estimate by the Rhodium Group, an independent research organization, found a net fall of just 0.2 percent in economy-wide emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lower manufacturing output drove the modest decline, but it was undercut by increased air and road travel and higher electricity demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, emissions remain below pre-pandemic levels and about 20 percent below 2005 levels, the benchmark year for US commitments under the Paris Agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accord aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, to avert the worst catastrophes of planet-wide heating.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with 2024 effectively static, decarbonisation must accelerate across all sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To meet its Paris Agreement target of a 50-52 percent reduction in emissions by 2030, the US must sustain an ambitious 7.6 percent annual drop in emissions from 2025 to 2030," the report said - an unprecedented pace outside of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has signaled plans to roll back President Joe Biden's green policies, including rules that require sweeping cuts from fossil fuel power plants and provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, which channels hundreds of billions of dollars into clean energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Should these plans materialize, the US would likely achieve only a 24-40 percent emissions reduction by 2035, the report concluded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even under Biden, the US has logged more tepid reductions compared to some other major emitters.
  <br>
  <br>
  German greenhouse gas emissions fell by three percent in 2024, following a 10 percent year-on-year drop the previous year, according to Agora Energiewende.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union's emissions are forecast to have dropped by 3.8 percent in 2024, according to Carbon Brief, a UK-based analysis site. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Wednesday cancelled the final overseas trip of his presidency just hours before he was set to depart for Rome and the Vatican, choosing to remain in Washington to monitor the response to devastating fires raging in California.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden was scheduled to leave Thursday afternoon, after eulogising former president Jimmy Carter at a memorial service in Washington, for the three-day trip to meet with Pope Francis and Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trip was meant as a coda to the second Catholic US president’s time in the White House and a final opportunity to showcase the strength of American alliances before he leaves office on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement of the trip’s cancellation comes just hours after Biden departed Los Angeles after meeting his first great-grandchild, who was born Wednesday at an area hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  He received a briefing from local fire officials before returning to Washington, as smoke and ash from blazes raging in the area clouded the daytime sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  “After returning this evening from Los Angeles, where earlier today he had met with police, fire and emergency personnel fighting the historic fires raging in the area and approved a Major Disaster declaration for California, President Biden made the decision to cancel his upcoming trip to Italy to remain focused on directing the full federal response in the days ahead,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The large Palisades fire sparked on Tuesday morning as Biden was in Los Angeles, and the high winds that helped fuel its massive spread forced the president to scrub a planned visit to Thermal to announce two new national monuments .
  <br>
  <br>
  While flying back to Washington on Wednesday, Biden approved a federal major disaster declaration for Los Angeles County, allowing for federal funding to be made available for temporary housing and home repairs as well as low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also provides additional financial assistance to state and local governments to cover the costs of fighting and cleaning up after the fires. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian army divers retrieved the body of one of at least nine miners trapped inside a flooded coal mine in India’s northeastern Assam state, officials said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The miners became trapped on Monday when water gushed in from a nearby unused mine in the Umrangso area in Dima Hasao district, about 200 kilometres south of the state capital, Guwahati.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Army deep divers have found and retrieved one body from the flooded mine. The divers will go into the mine again to continue their search operations,” said Kaushik Rai, a local government minister who is monitoring the rescue efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 100 rescuers from the police, navy, army and the National Disaster Response Force are battling adverse conditions and taking turns searching inside the 90 metre-deep mine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The navy is also sending in remotely-operated vehicles to examine the mine.
  <br>
  <br>
  “High suction pumps are being flown into the site by Indian Air Force helicopters to aid in pumping out the water from the mine,” Rai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The water in the mine is estimated to be 30 metres deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on the social media platform X that the mine appeared to be illegal and that police had arrested one person as they investigated the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Workers at the site said over a dozen miners had been trapped inside the mine, and some managed to escape as water from the nearby unused mine began pouring in. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wind-fueled wildfires continued to grow on Wednesday as overtaxed fire crews battled at least three major out-of-control blazes that killed at least five people and ravaged some of the most picturesque neighbourhoods in the Los Angeles area.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fires blanketed the city with a thick cloud of smoke and ash and destroyed homes across the metropolitan area, from the Pacific Coast inland to Pasadena, home of the famed Rose Parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the fires was the most destructive in the modern history of the city of LA and reduced grocery stores and banks to rubble, levelling entire blocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  With thousands of firefighters already attacking the flames, the Los Angeles Fire Department put out a plea for off-duty and out-of-state firefighters to help. The winds temporarily stopped aircraft from dumping water from above until they were able to resume flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Images of the devastation showed luxurious homes that collapsed in a whirlwind of flaming embers. Swimming pools were blackened with soot, and sports cars slumped on melted tires.

   “This morning, we woke up to a dark cloud over all of Los Angeles. But it is darkest for those who are most intimately impacted by these fires. It has been an immensely painful 24 hours,” LA County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath said.
   <br>
   <br>
   At least 70,000 people were ordered to evacuate - a number that kept changing because evacuation orders were continually being issued, officials said.
   <br>
   <br>
   The flames marched toward highly-populated and affluent neighbourhoods, including Calabasas and Santa Monica, home to California’s rich and famous. Hollywood stars, including Mark Hamill, Mandy Moore and James Woods, were among those forced to flee.

    The fires have consumed a total of about 108 square kilometres.
    <br>
    <br>
    Flames moved so quickly that many barely had time to escape. Police sought shelter inside their patrol cars, and residents at a senior living centre were pushed in wheelchairs and hospital beds down a street to safety in the foothills northeast of LA.
    <br>
    <br>
    California’s wildfire season typically begins in June or July and runs through October, according to the Western Fire Chiefs Association, but January wildfires are not unprecedented. There was one in 2022 and 10 in 2021, according to CalFire.
    <br>

    The winds increased to 129 kph on Wednesday, according to reports received by the National Weather Service, and could top 160 kph in mountains and foothills.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Antarctic sea ice rebounded in December after a long period of record lows, US scientists said, giving pause to speculation that Earth's frozen continent could be undergoing a permanent change.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rate of sea ice loss during the warmer spring months of November and December slowed to well below average, the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) said in a statement on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  This followed a "prolonged period of record to near-record daily lows" in 2023 and 2024 – the hottest years in the history books for global temperature rises driven by climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the end of 2024, Antarctic sea ice extent had recovered to 7.3 million square kilometres – very close to the 1981 to 2010 average, NSIDC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This erased the record and near-record low extents of October and November, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This provides a sharp illustration of the high variability of Antarctic sea ice extent," NSIDC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean temperature records – both at the surface and deep below – have tumbled since 2023, driven partly by an El Nino phenomenon that elevated heat around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists have been concerned since mid-2016 that global warming could be setting in motion more lasting changes in how much sea ice forms around the world's coldest continent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NSIDC said this "regime-shift idea" took hold particularly after a persistent stretch of below-average sea ice and "dramatic" records or near-records in 2017, 2023 and 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recent slowdown in extent loss during December gives some pause to this idea," it said, though cautioned that a one-month rebound was not enough to contradict the theory outright.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, sea ice concentrations in Antarctica remain "generally low over large areas of the pack," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This, combined with indications of a warm spring with high surface melting on the continent itself, will make for an interesting upcoming summer." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Denmark's foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the Danish Realm is " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786706_1_20250109033110.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European leaders on Wednesday warned Donald Trump against threatening "sovereign borders" after the US President-elect refused to rule out military action to take Greenland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Germany's Olaf Scholz said Trump's comments had sparked "notable incomprehension" among EU leaders the chancellor had spoken with.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has designs on the mineral- and oil-rich Arctic island, an autonomous territory of European Union member Denmark that itself has eyes on independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  He set off new alarm bells on Tuesday at a news conference when he refused to rule out military intervention over the Panama Canal and Greenland, both of which he has said he wants the United States to control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need Greenland for national security purposes," he declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also labelled the US-Canada border an "artificially drawn line" and promised to rename the Gulf of Mexico the "Gulf of America."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Berlin, Scholz convened a press conference at short notice and stressed that the "inviolability of borders is a fundamental principle of international law."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a later tweet in English, Scholz reiterated Berlin's position that "borders must not be moved by force" and that Trump's latest outburst had cause "uneasiness" among European governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referring indirectly to Russia's war in Ukraine, Scholz said that the principle of sovereign borders "applies to every country, whether in the East or the West."
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark itself struck a more emollient tone, even as Trump threatened to slap high tariffs on Copenhagen if it refused to cede Greenland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the Danish Realm – which includes Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands – is "open to a dialogue with the Americans on how we can cooperate, possibly even more closely than we already do, to ensure that American ambitions are fulfilled."
  <br>
  <br>
  French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Greenland was "European territory" and there was "no question of the EU letting other nations in the world, whoever they may be... attack its sovereign borders."
  <br>
  <br>
  Greenland has been autonomous since 1979 and has its own flag, language and institutions. But justice, monetary, defence and foreign affairs all remain under Danish control. (AFP)

    UK expands Electronic Travel Authorisation

<img alt="Eligible travellers will need one even if they are just using the UK to connect to an onward flight abroad. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786690_1_20250108215342.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Visitors to the UK from dozens of countries and regions - including the Hong Kong SAR, the United States, Canada and Australia - must now pay to enter Britain after a new visa-waiver entry system was extended on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme -- similar to the ESTA system in the United States -- requires visitors who do not need a visa to enter Britain to acquire pre-travel authorisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Costing £10 (US$12.50) and allowing stays of up to six months at a time over two years, it first launched in 2023, with Qatar, before being extended last year to five regional Gulf neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, it has been expanded to include citizens of around 50 more countries and territories, from Argentina, Brazil and New Zealand to Japan, South Korea and Caribbean nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the system kicking in for them on Wednesday, they have been able to apply since last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme, aimed at tightening border security, will next be extended to dozens of EU and European countries and territories on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those citizens covered by the scheme will be able to apply for the new ETA -- which is digitally linked to the traveller's passport -- via an app, from March 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around six million people from the United States, Canada and Australia visit Britain each year, according to the UK government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible travellers will need one even if they are just using the UK to connect to an onward flight abroad. ETA also applies to children and babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naila Hadi, a US woman in her fifties, told AFP at London's Heathrow Airport that the new system was "easy" to navigate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did it on our phones and they just scanned the passport, because this passport has a chip,... and within 20 minutes we got our approval," said Hadi, who had arrived from New Jersey with her daughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackie Day, a 77-year-old arriving from Vancouver, said: "My only quibble is that when I selected the country I was applying from, Canada, I had to pay in US dollars."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had to scan the passport, I had to scan my face plus take a picture of my face and fill out basic information about where I live, nothing complicated," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Northern Ireland economy minister Conor Murphy warned that ETA will have a "devastating" impact on tourism in the British province, given that its neighbour the Republic of Ireland is not involved with the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Murphy fears that the cost and red tape will deter international tourists visiting the Republic from making the journey across the land border to visit Northern Ireland, and has called for a time-limited exemption for people visiting up to seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow has also opposed the scheme, saying its rollout has reduced the number of passengers transiting through the UK, and that it makes the country "less competitive" and harms economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new requirement does not apply to British and Irish citizens, those with passports from British overseas territories and legal UK residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  It does not change the requirements for citizens of countries who need a visa to visit Britain, such as Chinese, Ecuadorian and South African travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously, most visitors not requiring a visa could arrive at a British airport and proceed through immigration control with their passport.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new UK entry scheme mirrors the imminent ETIAS scheme for visa-exempt nationals travelling to 30 European countries, including France and Germany, which will cost seven euros ($7.40) and last three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission expects the system -- which will apply to around 60 countries, including the United States, Canada, Brazil and the UK -- to become operational in the middle of this year. (AFP)

 A rapidly growing series of wildfires raged across sections of Los Angeles on Tuesday, destroying numerous buildings, clogging roadways as more than 30,000 people evacuated their homes, while a second blaze doubled in size some 50 kilometres inland and a third began in the San Fernando Valley. Firefighters battled the wind-whipped fires throughout the day as officials prepared for the situation to worsen early Wednesday local time.

   At least 2,921 acres (1,182 hectares) of the Pacific Palisades area between the coastal towns of Santa Monica and Malibu had burned by the Palisades Fire, officials said, after they had already warned of extreme fire danger from powerful winds that arrived following extended dry weather.
   <br>
   <br>
   A fire official told local television station KTLA that several people were injured, some with burns to faces and hands.
   <br>
   <br>
   The official added that one female firefighter had sustained a head injury.
   <br>
   <br>
   The second blaze dubbed the Eaton Fire broke out some 50 kilometres inland near Pasadena and doubled in size to 400 acres (162 hectares) in a few hours, according to Cal Fire.
   <br>
   <br>
   Almost 100 residents from a nursing home in Pasadena were evacuated, according to CBS News.
   <br>
   <br>
   Video showed elderly residents, many in wheelchairs and on gurneys, crowded onto a smokey and windswept parking lot as fire trucks and ambulances attended.
   <br>
   <br>
   Fire officials said a third blaze named the Hurst Fire had started in Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley northwest of Los Angeles, prompting evacuations of some nearby residents.

   Witnesses reported a number of homes on fire with flames nearly scorching their cars when people fled the hills of Topanga Canyon, as the fire spread from there down to the Pacific Ocean.
   <br>
   <br>
   Local media reported the fire had spread north, torching homes near Malibu.
   <br>
   <br>
   Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley had earlier told a press conference that more than 25,000 people in 10,000 homes were threatened.
   <br>
   <br>
   Firefighters in aircraft scooped water from the sea to drop it on the nearby flames.
   <br>
   <br>
   Flames engulfed homes and bulldozers cleared abandoned vehicles from roads so emergency vehicles could pass, television images showed.
   <br>
   <br>
   The fire singed some trees on the grounds of the Getty Villa, a museum loaded with priceless works of art, but the collection remained safe largely because of preventive efforts to trim brush surrounding the buildings, the museum said.
   <br>
   <br>
   With only one major road leading from the canyon to the coast, and only one coastal highway leading to safety, traffic crawled to a halt, leading people to flee on foot.
   <br>
   <br>
   Cindy Festa, a Pacific Palisades resident, said that as she evacuated out of the canyon, fires were "this close to the cars," demonstrating with her thumb and forefinger.
   <br>
   <br>
   "People left their cars on Palisades Drive. Burning up the hillside. The palm trees - everything is going," Festa said from her car.
   <br>
   <br>
   Before the fire started, the National Weather Service had issued its highest alert for extreme fire conditions for much of Los Angeles County from Tuesday through Thursday, predicting wind gusts of 80 to 130 kph.
   <br>
   <br>
   With low humidity and dry vegetation due to a lack of rain, the conditions were "about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather," the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service said on X.
   <br>
   <br>
   Governor Gavin Newsom, who declared a state of emergency, said the state positioned personnel, firetrucks and aircraft elsewhere in Southern California because of the fire danger to the wider region, he added.
   <br>
   <br>
   The powerful winds changed President Joe Biden's travel plans, grounding Air Force One in Los Angeles.
   <br>
   <br>
   He had planned to make a short flight inland to the Coachella Valley for a ceremony to create two new national monuments in California but the event was rescheduled for a later date at the White House.
   <br>
   <br>
   "I have offered any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire," Biden said in a statement.
   <br>
   <br>
   A federal grant had already been approved to help reimburse the state of California for its fire response, Biden said.
   <br>
   <br>
   Pacific Palisades is home to several Hollywood stars. Actor James Woods said on X he was able to evacuate but added, "I do not know at this moment if our home is still standing." (Reuters)
