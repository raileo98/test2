<div class="itemFullText">
 Louisiana health authorities on Monday reported the first human death in the United States linked to bird flu, while noting the patient had underlying medical conditions and that general risks to the public remained "low".
 <br>
  <br>
  The patient, aged over 65, had been hospitalised in the southern state since at least mid-December, when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced it as the country's first serious case of human infection from the H5N1 virus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk," the Louisiana Department of Health said in a statement announcing the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the patient had "contracted H5N1 after exposure to a combination of a non-commercial backyard flock and wild birds," but had detected no further H5N1 infections nor evidence of person-to-person transmission in the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news comes just days after the federal government awarded an additional US$306 million to bolster H5N1 surveillance programs and research, amid some criticism for President Joe Biden's administration over its response to the simmering issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The amount of bird flu circulating among animals and humans has alarmed scientists over concerns it could mutate into a more transmissible form – potentially triggering a deadly pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the beginning the 2024, the CDC has recorded 66 cases of bird flu in humans in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of data that shows that this virus can be lethal, more lethal than many viruses we worry about," Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology at Brown University said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For that reason, people have been quite alarmed about these outbreaks that have been occurring on farms and other places in the US and have really been shouting for the US government to do more," she added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean anti-graft investigators were waiting on Tuesday for a new court-ordered arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose failed martial law bid threw the country into turmoil.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former star prosecutor has refused questioning three times over a bungled martial law decree last month and is holed up in his residence surrounded by hundreds of guards preventing his arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is likely a new warrant will be granted by the same court that issued the first order, which expired after seven days, but investigators refused to disclose the duration of the new warrant they were seeking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Joint Investigation Headquarters today refiled a warrant with the Seoul Western District Court to extend the arrest warrant for defendant Yoon," the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) said in a statement late on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Details regarding the validity period cannot be disclosed."
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no comment by investigators or the Seoul court on the new warrant being approved by Tuesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, CIO deputy director Lee Jae-seung told reporters on Tuesday before it was refiled that the likelihood the court would not grant an extension was "very low".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is being investigated on charges of "insurrection" and, if formally arrested and convicted, faces prison or, at worst, the death penalty. His failed martial law decree plunged South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He would also become the first sitting president in South Korean history to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyers repeatedly said the initial warrant was "unlawful" and "illegal", pledging to take further legal action against it. (AFP)

<img alt="Winter arrives to Washington DC, on the day of a joint session of Congress to certify Donald Trump's election. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786417_1_20250107094255.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge swathe of the US was blasted with ice, snow and wind on Monday as the polar vortex that dipped south over the weekend kept much of the country east of the Rockies in its frigid grip, making many roads treacherous, forcing school closures, and causing widespread power outages and flight cancellations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The immense storm system brought disruption to areas of the country that usually escape winter's wrath, downing trees in some Southern states, threatening a freeze in Florida and causing people in Dallas to dip deep into their wardrobes for hats and gloves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington DC received heavy snow as President-elect Donald Trump’s victory was certified. Taking advantage of the rare snowstorm in the nation’s capital, revellers engaged in a snowball fight in front of the Washington Monument as flags flew at half-staff in memory of former President Jimmy Carter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ice and snow blanketed major roads in Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the National Guard was activated to help stranded motorists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions brought wind gusts of up to 72 kph. The warnings extended to New Jersey into early Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole, but it sometimes plunges southward into the US, Europe and Asia. Studies show that a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  School closings were widespread, with districts in Indiana, Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri and Kansas cancelling or delaying the start of classes on Monday. Classes were also cancelled in Maryland, where Governor Wes Moore declared a state of emergency on Sunday and announced that state government offices would also be closed the next day.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 2,500 flights were cancelled and at least 6,500 more were delayed nationwide as of Monday morning, according to tracking platform FlightAware. (AP)

    US Congress certifies Trump election victory

<img alt="Kamala Harris oversaw the certification proceedings in her role as president of the Senate. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786387_1_20250107041627.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Congress formally certified Republican President-elect Donald Trump's election victory on Monday during a session presided over by Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost the November contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The quadrennial ritual, clearing the way for Trump's inauguration in two weeks, went smoothly - in sharp contrast to four years ago when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to block the certification of then-President Trump's 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump continues to falsely claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, and had warned throughout his 2024 campaign that he harboured similar concerns until his November 5 defeat of Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris oversaw the roll call of the states in the vice president's ceremonial role as president of the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress certifies our great election victory today - a big moment in history. MAGA!" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social earlier on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint session of Congress proceeded despite a winter storm that dropped about 15 centimetres of snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final certification backed up preliminary findings that Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris's 226.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans also captured a majority in the US Senate and held a narrow edge in the House in November's election, which will give Trump the party support he needs to implement his planned agenda of tax cuts and a crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats did not try to block certification of Trump's victory on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security inside and outside the Capitol was heightened in preparation for the certification and was expected to remain in place through Trump's swearing-in on January 20. (Reuters)

    Canada PM Trudeau announces resignation

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday that he will step down as leader of the ruling Liberals after nine years in office but will stay on in his post until the party chooses a replacement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau, under heavy pressure from Liberal legislators to quit amid polls showing the party will be crushed at the next election, said at a news conference that parliament would be suspended until March 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means Trudeau will still be prime minister on January 20 when US President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs that would cripple Canada's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I intend to resign as party leader as prime minister after the party selects its next leader through a robust, nationwide competitive process," Trudeau said. "This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau, 53, took office in November 2015 and won re-election twice, becoming one of Canada's longest-serving prime ministers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But his popularity started dipping two years ago amid public anger over high prices and a housing shortage, and his fortunes never recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament was due to resume on January 27 and opposition parties had vowed to bring down the government as soon as they could, most likely at the end of March. But if parliament does not return until March 24, the earliest they could present a non-confidence motion would be some time in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau had until recently been able to fend off Liberal legislators worried about the poor showing in polls and the loss of safe seats in two special elections last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But calls for him to step aside have soared since last month, when he tried to demote Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, one of his closest cabinet allies, after she pushed back against his proposals for more spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Freeland quit instead and penned a letter accusing Trudeau of "political gimmicks" rather than focusing on what was best for the country. (Reuters)

    UK PM Starmer defends record as public prosecutor

<img alt="Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer answers a question from the media during a visit to the Elective Orthopaedic Centre at Epsom Hospital. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786370_1_20250106223004.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended his work as Britain's top prosecutor on Monday, refusing to mention US billionaire Elon Musk by name but addressing his criticism that, long before he became leader, he had failed to prosecute gangs who sexually abused girls.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk, a close ally of US President-elect Donald Trump, has spent days posting messages on his social media site X accusing Starmer of what he said was a failure to prosecute gangs of men, mostly of a South Asian background, who raped young girls when he was director of public prosecutions (DPP) between 2008 and 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer declined to address some of Musk's other messages on X - including a poll asking whether the United States should liberate the UK from its "tyrannical government" - but strongly defended his record as DPP, saying he had overcome resistance to tackling the allegations by reopening cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was chief prosecutor for five years, I tackled that head-on ... and that's why I reopened cases that had been closed and supposedly finished. I brought the first major prosecution of an Asian grooming gang ... I changed the whole prosecution approach," he told a press conference, visibly angry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible are not interested in victims, they are interested in themselves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has refrained from commenting on Musk's increasingly critical comments of his tenure, but his impatience was clear when he tackled the allegations over cases involving gangs who systematically groomed and raped girls over a period of years, some of which coincided with his time as DPP.
  <br>
  <br>

    Nippon, US Steel file lawsuit after Biden blocks sale

<img alt="US and Nippon Steel are mounting a legal challenge against President Joe Biden's decision to block the deal. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786361_1_20250106211435.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nippon Steel and US Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration's decision to block a proposed nearly US$15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based American steel maker.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suit, filed on Monday in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, alleges that it was a political decision and violated the companies' due process.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the outset of the process, both Nippon Steel and US Steel have engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the transaction will enhance, not threaten, United States national security, including by revitalising communities that rely on American steel, bolstering the American steel supply chain, and strengthening America’s domestic steel industry," the companies said in a prepared statement Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Nippon Steel is the only partner both willing and able to make the necessary investments.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Nippon Steel had promised to invest US$2.7 billion in US Steel’s ageing blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania’s Mon Valley.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting US government approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because “a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  While administration officials have said the decision was unrelated to Japan's relationship with the US — this is the first time a US president has blocked a merger between a US and Japanese firm. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia's imprisoned former Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday won an appeal to pursue his bid to serve his remaining corruption sentence under house arrest.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an application in April last year, Najib said he had clear information that then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah issued an addendum order allowing him to finish his sentence under house arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib claimed the addendum was issued during a pardons board meeting on January 29 last year chaired by Sultan Abdullah that also cut his 12-year jail sentence by half and sharply reduced a fine. But the High Court tossed out his bid three months later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling on Monday, ordered the High Court to hear the merits of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision came after Najib's lawyer produced a letter from a Pahang state palace official confirming that then-Sultan Abdullah had issued the addendum order.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are happy that finally Najib has got a win,” his lawyer Mohamad Shafee Abdullah said. “He is very happy and very relieved that finally they recognised some element of injustice that has been placed against him.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawyer said Najib gave a thumbs-up in court when the ruling was read.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it was “criminal” for the government to conceal the addendum order. Shafee noted that a new High Court judge will now hear the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his application, Najib accused the pardons board, home minister, attorney-general and four others of concealing the sultan’s order “in bad faith.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sultan Abdullah hails from Najib’s hometown in Pahang. He ended his five-year reign on January 30 last year under Malaysia’s unique rotating monarchy system. A new king took office a day later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail has said he had no knowledge of such an order since he wasn't a member of the pardons board. The others named in Najib’s application have not made any public comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib, 71, served less than two years of his sentence before it was commuted by the pardons board. His sentence is now due to end on August 23, 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was charged and found guilty in a corruption case linked to the multibillion-dollar looting of state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pardons board didn’t give any reason for its decision and wasn’t required to explain. But the move has prompted a public outcry over the appearance that Najib was being given special privileges compared to other prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib set up the 1MDB development fund shortly after he took office in 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators allege at least US$4.5 billion was stolen from the fund and laundered by Najib’s associates through layers of bank accounts in the United States and other countries, financed Hollywood films and extravagant purchases that included hotels, a luxury yacht, art and jewellery.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than US$700 million landed in Najib’s bank accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib is still fighting graft charges in the main trial linking him directly to the scandal. (AP)

<img alt="Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could resign within the coming 24 hours, according to Canadian media reports. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786322_1_20250106165200.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may resign as soon as Monday, according to media reports, as he faces mounting dissent within his Liberal Party.
 <br>
  <br>
  National newspapers The Globe and Mail and The Toronto Star reported that sources inside Trudeau's Liberal Party expect him to step down ahead of its national caucus on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement may be made in the coming 24 hours, sources told both papers in stories they ran on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau's departure would leave his party without a leader just a few months before the next legislative elections, scheduled to be held by the end of October.
  <br>
  <br>
  It remained unclear whether Trudeau, 53, would remain as his party's interim leader or would vacate the position immediately if he tendered his resignation as prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau's popularity has waned in recent months, with his government narrowly surviving a series of no-confidence votes and critics calling for his resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has vowed to stay on to guide the Liberals to elections but has faced further pressure from incoming US president Donald Trump, who has threatened a 25-percent tariff on Canadian goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland quit in December after disagreeing with Trudeau over how to respond to Trump's apparent plan, in the first open dissent against the prime minister within his cabinet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau announced a major shakeup to his cabinet later that month, changing a third of his team in a bid to settle the political turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  He travelled to Florida in November to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in a bid to head off a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the US president-elect has since also landed humiliating blows against Trudeau on social media, repeatedly calling him "governor" of Canada and declaring that the United States' northern neighbour becoming the 51st US state is a "great idea."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau swept to power in 2015 and led the Liberals to two more ballot box victories in 2019 and 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he now trails his main rival, Conservative Pierre Poilievre, by 20 points in public opinion polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eldest son of the charismatic former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, who died in 2000, Justin Trudeau came late to politics after working as a snowboard instructor, bartender, bouncer and teacher.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was first elected to the House of Commons in 2008 to represent a working-class Montreal neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  He brought in Senate reforms, signed a new trade deal with the United States and introduced a carbon tax to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions during his first two terms as prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  The married father of three also legalised cannabis, held a public inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and passed legislation permitting medically assisted suicide. (AFP)

    NKorean missile launch marks Blinken's Seoul visit

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a North Korean missile test carried out during his visit to Seoul on Monday was a reminder of the need to deepen Washington's cooperation with South Korea and Japan to deter an emboldened Pyongyang.
 <br>
  <br>
  North Korea fired what appeared to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile at around noon, which flew more than 1,100 kilometres east before falling into the sea, according to South Korea's military.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking a few hours later, Blinken told a news conference the launch underscored the importance of collaboration between the US, South Korea and Japan, including on sharing real-time missile data and holding trilateral military exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's launch is just a reminder to all of us of how important our collaborative work is," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken also warned of Pyongyang's deepening ties with Moscow. He said Washington believed Russia intended to share space and satellite technology with North Korea in exchange for its support in the conflict with Ukraine, in which more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden, who leaves office this month, made headway in deepening trilateral cooperation between the US and South Korea and Japan, despite historic issues that have often plagued relations between the Asian neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  But political turmoil in South Korea, together with the imminent return of the unpredictable rule of Donald Trump in the United States, has raised questions over whether those efforts can be sustained.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean lawmakers last month voted to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol and suspend him from duties after his December 3 declaration of martial law stunned the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's impeachment trial is being heard by the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon is permanently removed from office, a presidential election would be called and the liberals -- seen as likely to win that contest -- have been critical of Yoon's efforts to partner with Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken, who also met on Monday with acting President Choi Sang-mok, told the news conference that while Washington had "serious concerns" about Yoon's actions, it had confidence in the country's institutions and democratic resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's launch was Pyongyang's first since November 5 when it fired at least seven short-range ballistic missiles. (Reuters)

<img alt='Surreal narco-musical "Emilia Perez" and epic immigrant drama "The Brutalist" were the big winners at the Golden Globes. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786308_1_20250106151208.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 "The Brutalist," the story of a Holocaust survivor who chases the American dream, and musical thriller "Emilia Perez", took home the first major movie honours of Hollywood's awards season at the Golden Globes on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Voters for the Globes, handed out by entertainment journalists around the world, named "The Brutalist" best movie drama and star Adrien Brody the best drama film actor. The film also landed the best director prize for Brady Corbet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brody, who plays an architect trying to build a life in the United States, called the movie from independent studio A24 "a monument to humanity and the arts."
  <br>
  <br>
  "To the many people who have struggled emigrating to this country, I hope this work stands to lift you up a bit and give you a voice," Brody said on stage at the black-tie event in Beverly Hills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Emilia Perez," about a Mexican drug lord who transitions to a woman, claimed best movie musical or comedy. The Spanish-language Netflix movie led all films with four awards in total, including a supporting actress honor for Zoe Saldana.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The light always wins over the darkness," said Karla Sofía Gascón, the trans actor who plays the lead role in "Emilia Perez." "You can never take away our soul, or existence or identity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Globes kick off a marathon awards season in Hollywood that culminates with the Academy Awards in March. Winning a Globe can shine a spotlight on movies angling for the coveted best picture prize at the Oscars.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wicked," the box office smash based on the popular Broadway musical, claimed the Globe for cinematic and box office achievement. Director Jon M. Chu spoke of his love for movies as he was surrounded by the cast on stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When pessimism and cynicism sort of rule the planet right now, we can still make art, and still make art that is an act of optimism, that is empowerment and that is joy," Chu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a surprise, Demi Moore won best actress in a musical or comedy film for her leading role in "The Substance," the story of a fading actress seeking a fountain of youth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for movies such as "St. Elmo's Fire" and "Ghost," Moore told the crowd that she had once been dismissed as a "popcorn actress" and feared her career was over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just in shock right now," Moore said as she held her trophy on stage. "I've been doing this a long time, over 45 years. This is the first time I've ever won anything as an actor."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other awards, Brazil's Fernanda Torres took the trophy for best actress in a movie drama for Portuguese language film "I'm Still Here." The movie tells the story of a woman who must reinvent herself after her family is shattered by violence during the military dictatorship in Brazil in 1971.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sebastian Stan was named best actor in a film musical or comedy for "A Different Man," a movie about a man with facial disfigurement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our ignorance and discomfort around disability and disfigurement has to end now," Stan said. "We have to normalize it and continue to expose ourselves to it and our children." (Reuters)

    Police asked to take over efforts to detain Yoon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s anti-corruption agency has asked police to take over efforts to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after its investigators failed to bring him to custody following an hours-long standoff with the presidential security service last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency and police confirmed the discussion on Monday, hours before the one-week warrant for Yoon’s detention was to expire. Broadcaster YTN says the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials will seek a new court warrant to extend the window for Yoon’s detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seoul Western District Court had issued a warrant to detain Yoon on December 31, after he dodged several requests by investigators to appear for questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-corruption agency, which leads a joint investigation with police and military investigators, is weighing charges of rebellion after the conservative president, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by a legislature dominated by the liberal opposition, declared martial law on December 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of Yoon's die-hard supporters had camped outside his compound in the bitter cold, some holding all-night prayer sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They chanted "Illegal warrant is invalid" as police and media gathered outside the residence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also faces a separate Constitutional Court hearing that will confirm or reject his impeachment by parliament. (Agencies)

    Heavy snow brings chaos across Europe

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavy snow and freezing rain brought widespread disruption across Europe on Sunday, particularly in the UK and Germany, with several major airports forced to suspend flights.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Grid, which oversees the UK's electricity network, said it had been working to restore power after outages across the country. Power cuts were reported in the English cities of Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, and Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's John Lennon Airport and Manchester Airport had to close runways overnight, but were returning to normal on Sunday. Leeds Bradford Airport took longer to get flights back in the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  The road network was heavily impacted too on what would have been a very busy day with many families returning home from the Christmas and New Year's break, and students heading back to universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many roads had been pre-emptively closed by local authorities, but stranded vehicles and collisions caused disruption elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of UK train services were cancelled, with National Rail warning of disruption continuing into the working week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's main weather forecaster, the Met Office, says sleet and snow will continue to push north on Sunday and will be heaviest in northern England and into southern Scotland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Snow and ice were also causing havoc in Germany, where a bout of wintry weather is spreading from the southwest. Authorities have issued black ice warnings for drivers and pedestrians, advising people to stay home where possible. (AP)

    US hit by massive winter storm

<div class="itemFullText">
 A blast of snow, ice, wind and plunging temperatures stirred up dangerous travel conditions in parts of the central US on Sunday, as a disruptive winter storm brought the possibility of the “heaviest snowfall in a decade” to some areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Snow and ice blanketed major roadways in nearly all of Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the state's National Guard was activated to help any motorists who were stuck.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 20 centimetres of snow were expected, particularly north of Interstate 70, as the National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The warning extended to New Jersey for Monday and into early Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For locations in this region that receive the highest snow totals, it may be the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade,” the weather service said early Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 63 million people in the US were under some kind of winter weather advisory, watch or warning on Sunday, according to Bob Oravec with the National Weather Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole.  People in the US, Europe and Asia experience its intense cold when the vortex escapes and stretches south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Studies show a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its icy grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roughly 25 centimetres of snow had fallen in parts of the state, with snow and sleet totals predicted to top 35 centimetres for parts of Kansas and northern Missouri.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parts of upstate New York saw 0.9 metres or more of snow from a lake effect event expected to last until late Sunday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm was then forecast to move into the Ohio Valley and reach the Mid-Atlantic states on Sunday and Monday, with a hard freeze expected as far south as Florida. (AP)

 President Joe Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 19 of the most famous names in politics, sports, entertainment, civil rights, LGBTQ+ advocacy and science on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton received a standing ovation as she received her medal. Clinton was accompanied to the event by her husband former president Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and grandchildren. Democratic philanthropist George Soros and actor-director Denzel Washington were also awarded the nation’s highest civilian honour in a White House ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For the final time as president I have the honour bestowing the Medal of Freedom, our nation’s highest civilian honour, on a group of extraordinary, truly extraordinary people, who gave their sacred effort, their sacred effort, to shape the culture and the cause of America,” Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Let me just say to each of you, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’ve done to help this country," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four medals were awarded posthumously. They went to George Romney, who served as both a Michigan governor and secretary of housing and urban development; former Attorney General and Sen. Robert F Kennedy; Ash Carter, a former secretary of defence; and Fannie Lou Hamer, who founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and laid the groundwork for the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy is father to Robert F Kennedy Jr, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for health and human services secretary. Biden said, “Bobby is one of my true political heroes. I love and I miss him dearly.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Romney is the father of former Utah Republican senator Mitt Romney, one of Trump's strongest conservative critics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has days left in the Presidential office and has spent the last few days issuing awards and medals to military veterans, law enforcement officials and exceptional Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the Medal of Freedom recipients have made “exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavours.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Major philanthropists receiving the award include Spanish American chef José Andrés, whose World Central Kitchen charity has become one of the world's most recognised food relief organisations, and Bono, the front man for rock band U2 and a social justice activist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soros' son Alex Soros accepted the medal on his father's behalf. In an emailed statement, Soros said: “As an immigrant who found freedom and prosperity in America, I am deeply moved by this honour."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports and entertainment stars recognised include professional soccer player Lionel Messi, who did not attend the event; retired Los Angeles Lakers basketball legend and businessman Earvin “Magic” Johnson; actor Michael J Fox, who is an outspoken advocate for Parkinson’s disease research and development; and William Sanford Nye, known to generations of students as “Bill Nye the Science Guy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other awardees include conservationist Jane Goodall; longtime Vogue Magazine editor-in-chief Anna Wintour; American fashion designer Ralph Lauren; American Film Institute founder George Stevens Jr.; entrepreneur and LGBTQ+ activist Tim Gill; and David Rubenstein, co-founder of The Carlyle Group global investment firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on 19 people, including the late Medgar Evers, US House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina and actor Michelle Yeoh.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Presidential Medal of Freedom was awarded 654 times between 1963 and 2024, according to the Congressional Research Service. Notable Medal of Freedom recipients from the past include Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Maya Angelou and Mother Teresa. (AP)

<img alt="An honour guard watches over the casket of former President Jimmy Carter at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum in Atlanta. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786178_1_20250105094240.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jimmy Carter's extended public farewell began on Saturday in Georgia, with the 39th US president’s casket tracing his long arc from the Depression-era South and family farming business to the pinnacle of American political power and decades as a global humanitarian.
 <br>
  <br>
  Those chapters shone throughout the opening stanza of a six-day state funeral intended to blend personalised memorials with the ceremonial pomp afforded to former presidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter died on December 29, aged 100.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He was an amazing man. He was held up and propped up and soothed by an amazing woman,” son James Earl “Chip” Carter III, told mourners at The Carter Center, referring to his father and former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who died in 2023 . “The two of them together changed the world. And it was an amazing thing to watch so close.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Grandson Jason Carter, who now chairs the center's governing board, said, “It's amazing what you can cram into a hundred years.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter’s children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren accompanied their patriarch as his hearse rode first through his hometown of Plains. The procession stopped at the farm where the future president toiled alongside the Black sharecroppers who worked for his father. The motorcade continued to Atlanta, stopping in front of the Georgia Capitol where Carter served as a state senator and reformist governor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finally, he arrived for his last visit to the Carter Presidential Center, which houses his presidential library and The Carter Center where he based his post-White House advocacy for public health, democracy and human rights, setting a new standard for what former presidents can accomplish after they yield power.
  <br>
  <br>
  “His spirit fills this place,” Jason Carter told the assembly that included some of the center's 3,000 employees worldwide. “You continue the vibrant living legacy of what is my grandfather’s life work,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pallbearers on Saturday came from the Secret Service that protected the Carters for almost a half-century and a military honour guard that included Navy service members for the only US Naval Academy graduate to reach the Oval Office. A military band played “Hail to the Chief” and the hymn “Be Thou My Vision” for the commander in chief who also was a devout Baptist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jimmy Carter will remain at the Carter Presidential Center from 7pm on Saturday through 6am on Tuesday, so the public can pay their respects around the clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  National rites will continue in Washington and conclude on Thursday with a funeral at Washington National Cathedral, followed by a return to Plains. There, the former president will be buried next to his wife of 77 years near the home they built before his first state Senate campaign in 1962. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators again asked the country's acting president on Saturday to order the presidential security service to comply with an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol.
 <br>
  <br>
  The security service, along with military troops, on Friday prevented prosecutors from arresting Yoon Suk Yeol in a six-hour standoff inside Yoon's compound. The investigators secured the warrant to arrest Yoon over his brief declaration of martial law last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is investigating the case, said on Saturday it had again asked acting President Choi Sang-mok, the nation's finance minister, to order the presidential security service to cooperate with the warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police asked the chief of the presidential security service, Park Chong-jun, to appear for questioning on Tuesday, Yonhap News reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's December 3 martial law declaration stunned South Korea and led to the first arrest warrant to be issued for a sitting president. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tomiko Itooka, a Japanese woman who was the world’s oldest person according to Guinness World Records, has died, an Ashiya city official said on Saturday. She was 116.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoshitsugu Nagata, an official in charge of elderly policies, said Itooka died on December 29 at a care home in Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, central Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Itooka, who loved bananas and a yogurt-flavoured Japanese drink called Calpis, was born on May 23, 1908. She became the oldest person last year following the death of 117-year-old Maria Branyas, according to the Gerontology Research Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  When she was told she was at the top of the World Supercentenarian Rankings List, she simply replied, “Thank you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  When Itooka celebrated her birthday last year, she received flowers, a cake and a card from the mayor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Osaka, Itooka was a volleyball player in high school and long had a reputation for a sprightly spirit, Nagata said. She climbed the 3,067-metre (10,062-foot) Mount Ontake twice.
  <br>
  <br>
  She married at 20, and had two daughters and two sons, according to Guinness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Itooka managed the office of her husband’s textile factory during World War II. She lived alone in Nara after her husband died in 1979.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is survived by one son, one daughter, and five grandchildren. A funeral service was held with family and friends, according to Nagata.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Gerontology Research Group, the world's oldest person is now 116-year-old Brazilian nun Inah Canabarro Lucas, who was born 16 days after Itooka. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar’s military government has released more than 6,000 prisoners and has reduced other inmates’ sentences as part of a mass amnesty marking the 77th anniversary of independence from Britain on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  They included just a small proportion of hundreds of political detainees jailed for opposing army rule since the military seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. That takeover was met with massive nonviolent resistance, which has since become a widespread armed struggle.
  <br>
  <br>
  State-run MRTV television reported that Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the military government, granted amnesties covering 5,864 prisoners from Myanmar, as well as 180 foreigners who will be deported. Mass prisoner releases are common on holidays and other significant occasions in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The terms of release warn that if the freed detainees violate the law again, they will have to serve the remainder of their original sentences in addition to any new sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate report, it said Min Aung Hlaing had commuted the life sentences of 144 prisoners to 15 years' imprisonment. The report provided no details about them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prisoner releases began on Saturday but can take a few days to be completed. In the country’s largest city, Yangon, buses took prisoners out of Insein Prison, where friends and families of detainees had waited since morning for the announced releases, at around 11:30 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no sign that the prisoner release would include Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been held virtually incommunicado by the military since it seized power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old Suu Kyi is serving a 27-year sentence after being convicted in a series of politically tinged prosecutions brought by the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her supporters and independent analysts say the cases against her are an attempt to discredit her and legitimise the military’s seizure of power while keeping her from taking part in the military’s promised election, for which no date has yet been set. (AP)

    Trump hush money sentencing set for January 10

<img alt="Before Donald Trump, no US president - former or sitting - had been charged with or convicted of a crime. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786102_1_20250104101347.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced on January 10 in the criminal case in which he was convicted on charges involving hush money paid to a porn star, but is unlikely to face jail time or other penalties, a judge said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Justice Juan Merchan's ruling means Trump will be required to appear at a court hearing just 10 days before his Jan. 20 inauguration - an unprecedented scenario in US history. Before Trump, no US president - former or sitting - had been charged with or convicted of a crime.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said Trump, 78, may appear at his sentencing either in person or virtually.
  <br>
  <br>
  He wrote that he was not inclined to sentence Trump to jail, and that a sentence of "unconditional discharge" - meaning no custody, monetary fine, or probation - would be "the most viable solution."
  <br>
  <br>
  The imposition of the sentence would pave the way for Trump to appeal. Merchan acknowledged in his ruling that Trump has made clear he intends to appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said there should be no sentencing in the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merchan announced his plan for the sentencing in denying Trump's motion to dismiss the case due to his presidential election victory. Trump's defense lawyers had argued that having the case hang over him during his presidency would impede his ability to govern.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merchan rejected that argument, writing that setting aside the jury's verdict would "undermine the Rule of Law in immeasurable ways."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defendant's status as President-elect does not require the drastic and 'rare' application of (the court's) authority to grant the (dismissal) motion," Merchan wrote in the decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merchan also rejected Trump's argument in a December 3 court filing that dismissal was warranted because his "civic and financial contributions to this city and the Nation are too numerous to count."
  <br>
  <br>
  While acknowledging Trump's service as president, the judge said Trump's public statements excoriating the justice system were also a factor for him in determining how Trump's character would factor into the decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merchan criticized what he called Trump's "unrelenting and unsubstantiated attacks" against the integrity of the criminal proceeding, and noted that he had found him guilty of 10 counts of contempt during the trial for repeatedly violating an order restricting out-of-court statements about witnesses and others.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defendant has gone to great lengths to broadcast on social media and other forums his lack of respect for judges, juries, grand juries and the justice system as a whole," Merchan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defendant's character and history vis-a-vis the Rule of Law and the Third Branch of government must be analyzed," the judge said, referring to the judiciary. "In that vein, it does not weigh in his favor."
  <br>
  <br>
  The case stemmed from a US$130,000 payment that Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels. The payment was for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she has said she had a decade earlier with Trump, who denies it.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Manhattan jury in May found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payment. He had pleaded not guilty and called the case an attempt by Manhattan District Attorney Bragg, the Democratic prosecutor who brought the charges, to harm his 2024 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's sentencing was initially scheduled for July 11, 2024, but has been pushed back several times. On Thursday, Merchan said Trump's request in August that the sentencing be pushed back until after the election implied that he consented to being sentenced during the transition period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any claim Defendant may have that circumstances have changed as a result of Defendant's victory in the Presidential election, while convenient, is disingenuous," Merchan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bragg did not oppose delaying the sentencing until after the election. Merchan in September pushed it back to November 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, the judge delayed the sentencing indefinitely.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bragg's office had argued there were measures short of the "extreme remedy" of overturning the jury's verdict that could assuage Trump's concerns about being distracted by a criminal case while serving as president, such as delaying the sentence until after Trump leaves the White House in 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merchan wrote on Thursday he found that alternative "less desirable" than sentencing Trump before the inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on December 16 lost a separate bid to toss the hush money conviction in light of the US Supreme Court's July 1 decision that presidents cannot be criminally prosecuted over their official actions, and that evidence of their official actions cannot be presented in criminal cases over personal conduct.
  <br>
  <br>
  In denying Trump's motion to dismiss, Merchan said the prosecution over "decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the executive branch."
  <br>
  <br>
  Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison, but incarceration is not required. Before his election victory, legal experts said it was unlikely Trump would be locked up due to his lack of a criminal history and advanced age.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was charged in three other state and federal criminal cases in 2023: one involving classified documents he kept after leaving office and two others involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pleaded not guilty in all three cases. The Justice Department moved to dismiss the two federal cases after Trump's election victory.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Friday followed through on his pledge to block Nippon Steel's US$14.9 billion bid for US Steel, citing concerns the deal could hurt national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move, long expected, cuts off a critical lifeline of capital for the beleaguered American icon, which has said it would have to idle key mills without the nearly US$3 billion in promised investment from the Japanese firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also represents the final chapter in a high profile national security review, led by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets investment for national security risks and had until December 23 to approve, extend the timeline or recommend Biden block the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed tie-up has faced high-level opposition within the United States since it was announced a year ago, with both Biden and his incoming successor Donald Trump taking aim at it as they sought to woo union voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where US Steel is headquartered. Trump and Biden both asserted the company should remain American-owned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The merger appeared to be on the fast-track to be blocked after the companies received an August 31 letter from CFIUS, arguing the deal could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Nippon Steel countered that its investments, made by a company from an allied nation, would in fact shore up US Steel's output, and it won a 90-day review extension. That extension gave CFIUS until after the November election to make a decision, fueling hope among supporters that a calmer political climate could help the deal's approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  But hopes were shattered in December when CFIUS set the stage for Biden to block it in a 29-page letter by raising allegedly unresolved national security risks. (Reuters)

 A fire and thick smoke engulfed an eight-story building in the South Korean city of Seongnam on Friday, sending 12 people to hospital with smoke inhalation, and about 30 people who had been trapped were safely rescued, the fire department said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department deployed 82 vehicles and equipment south of Seoul to bring the blaze under control after the fire started in a restaurant on the ground floor of the busy commercial building, which also housed a swimming pool where children take lessons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, YTN television reported multiple people were trapped inside, with footage showing black smoke engulfing a large part of the building. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos has removed Vice President Sara Duterte from the National Security Council, according to an executive order released on Friday, a month after she allegedly plotted to kill him.
 <br>
  <br>
  The order, signed on Monday by Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, removed the vice president and all former presidents from the council which advises the president on policies affecting national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bersamin said the move was "to reorganise and streamline" its membership, which now comprises key legislative, defence, foreign and cabinet officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment, the VP is not considered relevant to the responsibilities of membership in the NSC," Bersamin told reporters, adding that the president was free to add other members or advisers as needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move comes as Duterte is facing an investigation over her alleged threat to kill Marcos and his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  In late November, Sara -- the 46-year-old daughter of former president Rodrigo Duterte -- delivered an expletive-laden online news conference in which she claimed to have told someone to kill Marcos if she was assassinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  She later said the comments were misinterpreted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president swept to power in 2022 in an alliance with Marcos that has unravelled spectacularly in recent months, with both sides trading allegations of drug addiction and extreme rhetoric ahead of this year's mid-term elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte is also subject of multiple impeachment complaints over her alleged misuse of millions of dollars in government funds. (AFP)

    Mission to arrest President Yoon stalled: officials

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators on Friday called off their attempt to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk-yeol over his failed martial law bid because of a standoff at his residence.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the execution of the arrest warrant today, it was determined that the execution was effectively impossible due to the ongoing standoff. Concern for the safety of personnel on-site led to the decision to halt the execution," the Corruption Investigation Office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, a former prosecutor, has defied investigators' attempts to question him for weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time he is known to have left the residence was on December 12, when he went to the nearby presidential office to make a televised statement to the nation, making a defiant statement that he will fight efforts to oust him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators from the country's anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament, declared martial law on December 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on December 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon’s detention on Tuesday, but enforcing it is complicated as long as he remains in his official residence. (Agencies)

    Al Jazeera condemns broadcast ban in West Bank

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Palestinian Authority (PA) has ordered the suspension of broadcasts by Al Jazeera in a move the Qatar-based television network condemned on Thursday as reminiscent of Israeli practices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Al Jazeera is already banned from broadcasting from Israel amid a long-running feud with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, masked Israeli troops raided the Al Jazeera office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority, to issue an initial 45-day closure order, in a move the PA foreign ministry slammed as "a flagrant violation" of press freedom at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the PA insisted its own suspension order was "temporary", adding its decision followed a complaint from the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate about the network's coverage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These measures shall be applied until Al Jazeera chooses to act in accordance with basic media ethics, including its duty to prevent deliberate disinformation, ban the glorification of violence and end the incitement to armed mutiny," the PA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The syndicate, which represents about 3,000 Palestinian journalists, said several had filed complaints against Al Jazeera for "biased media coverage on its platforms, including incitement, misleading reports and content that stirs internal discord".
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension order involves "temporarily freezing the work of all journalists, employees, crews and affiliated channels until their legal status is rectified", the official news agency Wafa reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Jazeera aired images of what appeared to be Palestinian security officers entering the network's office in Ramallah and handing over the suspension order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The network condemned the decision, saying it "aligns with Israeli occupation practices targeting its media teams".
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban on Al-Jazeera drew condemnation from press freedom organisations and the UN human rights office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Militant group Hamas, rivals of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah movement which dominates the PA, said the ban went against Palestinian interests. (AFP)

    Israeli air strike hits a Gaza humanitarian zone

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli air strikes killed at least 40 people, including several children, across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, hitting Hamas security officers and an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the daily bombardment continued, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he had authorised a delegation from the Mossad intelligence agency, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the military to continue negotiations in Qatar toward a ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli media said the delegation would depart on Friday. There was no immediate Hamas comment. The US-led talks have repeatedly stalled during 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli strike in the seaside humanitarian zone known as Muwasi occurred as hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians had been huddling there in damp winter weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel’s military said it targeted a senior police officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Israeli strike killed at least eight people in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. The men were members of local committees that help secure aid convoys, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate comment from Israel's military.
  <br>
  <br>
  In southern Gaza, the military killed five policemen in eastern Khan Younis. Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said the strike targeted the head of the Hamas internal security force in southern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war was sparked by Hamas-led militants’ October 7, 2023 attack into Israel. The militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel’s offensive in retaliation has killed over 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the dead. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their tally. (AP)

    Biggest trackway of dinosaur footprints found in UK

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers have uncovered hundreds of dinosaur footprints dating back to the middle Jurassic era in a quarry in Oxfordshire, southern England, showing that reptiles - such as the nine-metre predator Megalosaurus - moved along enormous tracks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The dig at Dewars Farm Quarry found five extensive trackways, one of which measured more than 150 metres in length, researchers from the Universities of Oxford and Birmingham said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four of the tracks were made by gigantic, long-necked, herbivorous dinosaurs called sauropods, most likely to be Cetiosaurus, an up to 18-metre-long cousin of the well-known Diplodocus, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth trackway was made by the carnivorous theropod dinosaur Megalosaurus, which had distinctive three-toed feet with claws.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carnivore and herbivore tracks, which are about 166 million-years-old, cross over at one point, raising questions about whether and how the two types of dinosaur were interacting, the researchers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Megalosaurus was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named and described in 1824, kick-starting the last 200 years of dinosaur science and public interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emma Nicholls, vertebrate palaeontologist ay the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, said: "Scientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found."
  <br>
  <br>
  The buried prints came to light when quarry worker Gary Johnson felt "unusual bumps" as he was stripping the clay back with his vehicle in order to expose the quarry floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 researchers then excavated in the site in June, where they found around 200 footprints, the universities said in a statement. (Reuters)

    FBI says driver in New Orleans rampage acted alone

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Army veteran who drove a truck into a crowd of New Year’s revellers in New Orleans acted alone, the FBI said on Thursday, reversing its position from a day earlier that he likely worked with others in the deadly attack that officials said was inspired by the Islamic State group.
 <br>
  <br>
  The FBI also revealed that the driver, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an American citizen from Texas, posted five videos on his Facebook account in the hours before the attack in which he proclaimed his support for the militant group and previewed the violence that he would soon unleash in the famed French Quarter district.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,” said Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterterrorism division, calling Jabbar “100 per cent inspired” by the Islamic State.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack along Bourbon Street killed 14 revellers, along with Jabbar, 42, who was fatally shot in a firefight with police after steering his speeding truck around a barricade and ploughing into the crowd. About 30 people were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raia stressed there was no indication of a connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion on Wednesday of a Tesla Cybertruck filled with explosives outside Trump’s Las Vegas hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The person inside that truck, a decorated US Army Green Beret, shot himself in the head just before detonation, authorities said. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators on Friday were attempting to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law decree last month, as hundreds of his supporters gathered near his residence in Seoul, vowing to protect him.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 20 investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials and police officers were seen entering the gate of Yoon’s residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for his detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  It wasn’t clear whether the president would cooperate with authorities trying to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon in a defiant New Year’s message to conservative supporters rallying outside his residence said he would “fight to the end” against “anti-state forces.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyers have described the warrant to detain him as “invalid” and “illegal.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon’s detention on Tuesday after he evaded multiple requests to appear for questioning and blocked searches of his office in Seoul, hindering an investigation into whether his ill-conceived power grab on December 3 amounted to rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The warrant is valid for one week, and investigators may make another attempt to detain Yoon if they are unable to do so on Friday. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A gunman who fatally shot at least 12 people, including two children, in Montenegro has killed himself while surrounded by police, officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least four others were wounded in the shooting rampage in the western town of Cetinje on Wednesday that followed a bar brawl, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooter, identified as 45-year-old Aco Martinović, killed the owner of the bar, the bar owner's children and his own family members, Interior Minister Danilo Šaranović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attacker, who was fled after the rampage, was later located and surrounded by police. He died after shooting himself in the head, Šaranović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had dispatched a special unit to search for the attacker in the town, which is located about 30 kilometres northwest of the capital, Podgorica.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the roads in and out of the city were blocked as police swarmed the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Šaranović said that Martinović had died while being taken to a hospital in the capital and succumbed from the “severity of his injuries.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has declared three days of national mourning starting on Thursday, with Prime Minister Milojko Spajić describing the shooting as a “terrible tragedy.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The level of rage and brutality shows that sometimes such people ... are even more dangerous than members of organized criminal gangs,” Šaranović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martinović was at the bar throughout the day with other guests when the brawl erupted, Police Commissioner Lazar Šćepanović said. He said that Martinović then went home, brought back a weapon and opened fire at around 5.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He killed four people” at the bar before heading out, and then continued shooting at three more locations, Šćepanović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the suspect received a suspended sentence in 2005 for violent behaviour and had appealed his latest conviction for illegal weapons possession. Montenegrin media have reported that he was known for erratic and violent behaviour. (AP)

File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785871_1_20250102150018.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of South Korean airline Jeju Air has been banned from leaving the country, police said on Thursday, after one of the company's Boeing 737-800 planes crashed last week killing 179.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The investigation team imposed a travel ban on two individuals, including Jeju Air CEO Kim E-bae," said police in South Jeolla Province, where the crash in Muan city happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, police on Thursday raided the offices of Jeju Air and the operator of Muan International Airport as part of the probe into the fatal crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight was carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea on Sunday when it issued a mayday call and belly-landed before slamming into a barrier, killing everyone aboard except two flight attendants pulled from the burning wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities carried out search and seizure operations at the Muan airport where flight 2216 crashed, a regional aviation office in the southwestern city, and Jeju Air's office in the capital Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators, including from Boeing, have been combing the crash site since the disaster to establish a cause, with both black boxes found and decoding work ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In relation to the plane accident... a search and seizure operation is being conducted…at three locations," police said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police plan to swiftly and rigorously determine the cause and responsibility for this accident in accordance with the law and principles."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap reported a search warrant was approved on charges of professional negligence resulting in death, citing officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has also announced it will inspect all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by its carriers, focusing on the landing gear, which appears to have malfunctioned during the Sunday crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's acting president, Choi Sang-mok, said on Thursday that "immediate action" must be taken if that probe uncovered any issues with the aircraft model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have previously said 101 aircraft of the same model were in operation by six different airlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As there's great public concern about the same aircraft model involved in the accident, the transport ministry and relevant agencies must conduct a thorough inspection of operation maintenance, education, and training," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If any issues are found during the inspection, please take immediate corrective action," he added. (AFP)

    Russian gas transit to Europe via Ukraine ends

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Ukraine came to a halt on New Year's Day, marking the end of decades of Moscow's dominance over Europe's energy markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gas had kept flowing despite nearly three years of war, but Russia's gas firm Gazprom said it had stopped after Ukraine refused to renew a transit agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The widely-expected stoppage will not impact prices for consumers in the European Union - unlike in 2022, when falling supplies from Russia sent prices to record highs, worsened a cost-of-living crisis and hit the bloc's competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last remaining EU buyers of Russian gas via Ukraine, such as Slovakia and Austria, have arranged alternative supplies, while Hungary will keep receiving Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline under the Black Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Russian region of Ukraine's neighbour Moldova also reliant on the transit flows, cut off heating and hot water supplies to households early on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local energy company Tirasteploenergo urged residents to dress warmly, hang blankets or thick curtains over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said the EU had prepared for the cut-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The European gas infrastructure is flexible enough to provide gas of non-Russian origin," a spokesperson for the Commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been reinforced with significant new LNG (liquefied natural gas) import capacities since 2022."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia and the former Soviet Union spent half a century building up a major share of the European gas market, which at its peak stood at around 35 percent. But the EU has slashed its dependence on Russian energy since the start of the war in Ukraine by buying more piped gas from Norway, and LNG from Qatar and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine, which refused to extend the transit deal, said Europe had already made the decision to abandon Russian gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its markets, it will suffer financial losses," Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in a statement. (Reuters)

    One dead after Cybertruck explodes outside Trump hotel

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least one person was killed and seven wounded when a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside a hotel belonging to US President-elect Donald Trump in Las Vegas, police said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The electric vehicle pulled up to the Trump International Hotel's glass entrance before a "large explosion," Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage shows the stainless steel truck parked at the hotel entrance before bursting into flames, followed by smaller explosions that appeared similar to fireworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  McMahill said there was "one deceased individual inside the Cybertruck" while seven people received "minor" injuries. He said the hotel had been evacuated.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden said authorities were investigating any possible link between the blast and an attack earlier Wednesday in New Orleans, in which a truck rammed a crowd, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thus far, there's nothing to report on that score," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla chief Elon Musk said the explosion was "caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck," adding in a post on X that it was "unrelated to the vehicle itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, he said the "whole Tesla senior team" was investigating the blast, adding: "We've never seen anything like this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they are still working to establish the cause of the explosion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, who backed Trump in the November election and was named by the Republican to head up a commission to trim government spending, said he would post more information "as soon as we learn anything." (AFP)

    New Orleans attack suspect was US-born army veteran

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New Orleans attack suspect, identified by the FBI as 42-year-old US citizen Shamsud-Din Jabbar, appeared to be a real estate agent from Texas who had spent 10 years as an IT specialist in his country's army.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a video posted on YouTube four years ago, Jabbar – speaking with a southern US accent – boasted of his skills as a "fierce negotiator" as he advertised his property management services to potential clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  Criminal records reported by the New York Times show that Jabbar had two previous charges for minor offences – one in 2002 for theft and another in 2005 for driving with an invalid licence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jabbar was twice-married, according to the newspaper, with his second marriage ending in divorce in 2022, when he detailed experiencing financial problems in an email to his wife's lawyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I cannot afford the house payment," he reportedly wrote, adding that his real estate company had lost more than US$28,000 in the previous year, and that he had taken on thousands in credit card debt to pay for lawyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper reported that Jabbar had gotten a degree from Georgia State University.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jabbar said in his YouTube video that he served in the US military for a decade as a human resources specialist and an IT specialist.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that with this experience, he "learned the meaning of great service and what it means to be responsive and take everything seriously, dotting I's and crossing T's to make sure that things go off without a hitch."
  <br>
  <br>
  The FBI confirmed at a news conference that Jabbar was a US army veteran but did not detail his role. The agency said it was believed that he had been honourably discharged, but that its probe was ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 15 people were killed and more than 30 wounded when Jabbar allegedly drove a truck at high speed into a crowd of New Year's revellers in New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said he crashed the vehicle, then opened fire and was killed in a shootout with police. (AFP)

 Ten people were killed and 30 injured when a vehicle drove into a crowd on New Orleans' famed Canal and Bourbon Street in the first hours of New Year's Day, according to NOLA Ready, the city’s emergency preparedness agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  New Orleans police earlier said they were responding to a mass casualty incident, including fatalities. NOLA Ready advised people to stay away from the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the injured had been taken to five local hospitals.
  <br>

  The incident came toward the end of New Year’s celebrations in New Orleans and hours before the kickoff of the AllState Bowl, a college football quarterfinal held in the city's Caesars Superdome, with thousands expected to be in attendance. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's minister of information in the country's transitional government told AFP he is working towards a free press and committed to "freedom of expression", after decades of tight control under the country's former rulers.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are working to consolidate freedoms of the press and expression that were severely restricted" in areas controlled by the former government of Bashar al-Assad, said the minister, Mohamed al-Omar, after Islamist-led rebels on December 8 ended more than five decades of rule by the Assad clan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's ruling Baath party and the Assad family dynasty heavily curtailed all aspects of daily life, including freedom of the press and expression with the media a tool of those in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reporters Without Borders, a freedom of information watchdog, ranked Syria second-last on its 2024 World Press Freedom Index, ahead only of Eritrea and behind Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a heavy restriction on freedom of the press and expression under the regime which practised censorship. In the period to come we are working on the reconstruction of a media landscape that is free, objective and professional," Omar said during an interview with AFP on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is part of the interim administration installed in Damascus by the victorious rebel coalition led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has its origins in the Syrian branch of the jihadist group Al-Qaeda and is designated a terrorist organisation by numerous governments, but has sought to soften its image in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diplomats from around the region and from the West have made contact with Syria's new rulers, who have also vowed to protect the country's religious and ethnic minorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Omar was previously minister of information in the self-proclaimed Salvation Government, the civil administration set up in 2017 by HTS in the rebel holdout of Idlib province, in Syria's northwest. It was from Idlib that the rebels began their lightning advance towards Damascus, 13 years into the country's civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the conflict erupted in 2011 with the government's brutal repression of pro-democracy protests, Assad tightened restrictions on independent journalism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want to continue in the same way, that is, have an official media whose aim is to polish the image of the ruling power," Omar said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following Assad's overthrow and flight to Moscow, Syrian media outlets which had trumpeted his regime's glories quickly adopted a revolutionary fervour.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday Omar held an exchange with dozens of Syrian journalists to discuss the transition. (AFP)

    Investigators vow to execute warrant for Yoon

<img alt="A supporter of impeached South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol holds up a placard. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785766_1_20250101162556.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators said on Wednesday they would execute an arrest warrant for Yoon Suk Yeol over his declaration of martial law by the deadline of January 6, as the impeached leader's supporters rallied outside his residence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Supporters and opponents of Yoon, who was suspended from office by lawmakers over his attempt to subvert civilian rule last month, have been camped outside the compound where he has been holed up for weeks, fending off investigators' efforts to question him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) requested the warrant after Yoon failed to report for questioning a third time, but it has been unclear whether they could execute it as the Presidential Security Service has previously refused to comply with search warrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  CIO chief Oh Dong-woon said on Wednesday the warrant would be executed "within the deadline", which is on Monday, January 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aim for a smooth process without major disturbances, but we are also coordinating to mobilise police and personnel in preparation," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also warned that anyone trying to block authorities from arresting Yoon could themselves face prosecution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We consider actions such as setting up various barricades and locking iron gates to resist the execution of our arrest warrant as obstruction of official duties," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anyone doing this "could be prosecuted under charges of abuse of authority interfering with the exercise of rights and obstruction of official duties by special means", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's legal team have filed for an injunction to block the warrant and claimed on Wednesday the arrest order was "an unlawful and invalid act", lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president's die-hard supporters raced to Seoul to support him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the presidential compound dozens of people -- some in elaborate costume -- could be seen chanting, singing and hurling vitriol at police.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point, some attempted to break through a cordon and block a police bus from parking near the entrance -- apparently mistaking it for the mobile force that may be dispatched to detain Yoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were sent to the area in large numbers and could be seen yelling at protesters to keep in line, but a route in and out of Yoon's residence remained clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean officials have previously failed to execute arrest warrants for lawmakers -- in 2000 and 2004 -- due to party members and supporters blocking police from entering for the seven-day period the warrant was valid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has been stripped of his presidential duties by parliament and faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the majority of Yoon's remaining staff, including his chief of staff and special advisors, all tendered their resignations to the country's acting president -- who rejected them, calling instead for unity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a time for everyone to come together for the stability of the livelihood of the people and national affairs," acting president Choi Sang-mok said
  <br>
  <br>
  The resignations were a show of discontent over Choi's decision to appoint two new judges to the constitutional court hearing Yoon's impeachment -- meeting a key demand of the opposition, but branded an overstepping of the powers of the acting leader by Yoon's staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president declared martial law in a televised address, saying it was aimed at eliminating "anti-state elements" but lawmakers rushed to parliament to vote it down.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, heavily armed troops stormed the building, scaling fences, smashing windows and landing by helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A constitutional court will rule whether to uphold Yoon's impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turmoil deepened late last week when Yoon's replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached by parliament for failing to sign bills for investigations into his predecessor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi took office on Friday and found himself thrust immediately into a disaster with the Jeju Air plane crash on Sunday that claimed 179 lives. (AFP)

<img alt="Sunday's Jeju Air crash at Muan International Airport was the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785745_1_20250101115248.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investigators probing a Jeju Air crash which killed 179 people in the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil have extracted the initial data from one of the Boeing 737-800's black boxes, an official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plane was carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea when it issued a mayday call and belly-landed before hitting a barrier and bursting into flames, killing everyone aboard except two flight attendants pulled from the burning wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators, including from Boeing, have been combing over the crash site in southwestern Muan since the disaster on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of the plane's black boxes were retrieved, and for the cockpit voice recorder, "the initial extraction has already been completed," said deputy minister for civil aviation Joo Jong-wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on this preliminary data, we plan to start converting it into audio format," he said, meaning investigators would be able to hear the pilots' final communications.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second black box, the flight data recorder, "was found with a missing connector," Joo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experts are currently conducting a final review to determine how to extract data from it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials initially pointed to a bird strike as a possible cause of the disaster, but they have since said the probe was also examining a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, which dramatic video showed the Boeing 737-800 colliding with before bursting into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have also been questions over possible mechanical failures, with local media reporting that the landing gear had deployed properly on Jeju Air Flight 2216's first failed landing attempt at Muan airport before failing on the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  The issue "will likely be examined by the Accident Investigation Board through a comprehensive review of various testimonies and evidence during the investigation process," the ministry of land, which oversees civil aviation, said at a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Muan airport, grieving families of victims had become increasingly frustrated by delays in identifying and releasing the bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have said the bodies were extensively damaged by the crash, making the work of identifying remains slow and immensely difficult, even as investigators had to preserve crash-site evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the country's acting president said on Wednesday the process had finally been completed, and that more bodies had been handed over to relatives so that they could hold funerals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overnight, the identification of all 179 victims was completed," said acting president Choi Sang-mok, who has been in office less than a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our investigators, along with the US National Transportation Safety Board and the manufacturer, are conducting a joint investigation into the cause of the accident," Choi said at a disaster response meeting on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A comprehensive analysis and review of the aircraft's structure and the black box data will reveal the cause of the accident," Choi added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US investigators had arrived on Monday and headed straight to Muan, with the initial on-site joint probe focusing on a navigation system that assists in aircraft landings, known as a localiser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The localiser, installed on a concrete structure at Muan International Airport, is the barrier that has been blamed for exacerbating the severity of the Jeju Air crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane was largely carrying holidaymakers back from year-end trips to Bangkok, with all passengers Korean nationals except for two Thais.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fuller account of what went wrong in the flight's final moments is expected once authorities have analysed the black boxes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Memorial altars for the victims have been set up nationwide, including in Seoul and at Muan airport. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 From Sydney to Mumbai to Nairobi, communities around the world began welcoming 2025 with spectacular light shows, embraces and ice plunges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Auckland became the first major city to celebrate, as thousands thronged downtown or climbed the city’s ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point. A light display recognised Indigenous people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Countries in the South Pacific Ocean were the first to ring in the New Year, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conflict muted acknowledgements of the start of 2025 in places like the Middle East, Sudan and Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fireworks blasted off the Sydney Harbour Bridge and across the bay. More than a million Australians and others gathered at the iconic Sydney Harbour for the celebration. British pop star Robbie Williams led a singalong with the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The celebration also featured Indigenous ceremonies and performances that acknowledged the land’s first people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Japan shut down ahead of the nation’s biggest holiday, as temples and homes underwent a thorough cleaning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming Year of the Snake in the Asian zodiac is heralded as one of rebirth – alluding to the reptile’s shedding skin. Other places in Asia will mark the Year of the Snake later, with the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In South Korea, celebrations were cut back or cancelled during a period of national mourning following Sunday's crash of a Jeju Air flight in Muan that killed 179 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Thailand's Bangkok, shopping malls competed for crowds with live musical acts and fireworks shows. A fireworks display in Indonesia's Jakarta featured 800 drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese state media covered an exchange of New Year’s greetings between leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in a reminder of the growing closeness between the two leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi told Putin their countries will “always move forward hand in hand,” the official Xinhua News Agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In India, thousands of revellers in the financial hub of Mumbai flocked to the city's bustling promenade facing the Arabian Sea. In Sri Lanka, people gathered at Buddhist temples to light oil lamps and incense sticks and pray.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Dubai, thousands attended a fireworks show at the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest skyscraper. And in Nairobi, Kenya, scattered fireworks were heard as midnight approached.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rome’s traditional New Year’s Eve festivities have an additional draw: the start of Pope Francis’ Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration projected to bring some 32 million pilgrims to the Eternal City in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Francis will celebrate a vespers at St. Peter’s Basilica, followed by Mass on Wednesday, when he is expected to again appeal for peace in Ukraine and the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  January 1 is a day of obligation for Catholics, marking the Solemnity of Mary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris capped a momentous 2024 with its traditional countdown and fireworks extravaganza on the Champs-Elysées. The city’s emblematic Arc de Triomphe monument was turned into a giant tableau for a light show that celebrated the city's landmarks and the passage of time, with whirring clocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Paris is a party,” proclaimed Mayor Anne Hidalgo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games hosted in the French capital from July to September had transformed the city into a site of joy, fraternity and astonishing sporting achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frank and Rowena Klar from San Francisco visited the French capital to celebrate 31 years together. “If you start it big, we think we’re going to have a great year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  London rang in the New Year with a pyrotechnic display along the River Thames. With a storm bringing bitter weather to other parts of the United Kingdom, however, festivities in Edinburgh, Scotland, were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Switzerland and some other places, people embraced the cold, stripping and plunging into the water in freezing temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rio de Janeiro will throw Brazil’s main New Year’s Eve bash on Copacabana Beach, with ferries offshore launching 12 straight minutes of fireworks. Thousands of tourists on cruise ships will witness the show up close.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 2 million people were expected at the Copacabana, hoping to squeeze into concerts by superstar Brazilian artists such as pop singer Anitta and Grammy-award winner Caetano Veloso.
  <br>
  <br>
  In New York City, the organisation managing Times Square has tested its famous ball drop and inspected 2025 numerals, lights and thousands of crystals as part of a tradition going back to 1907. This year’s celebration will include musical performances by TLC, Jonas Brothers, Rita Ora and Sophie Ellis-Bextor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Las Vegas' pyrotechnic show will be on the Strip, with 340,000 people anticipated as fireworks are launched from the rooftops of casinos. Nearby, the Sphere venue will display for the first time countdowns to midnight in different time zones.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Pasadena, California, Rose Parade spectators were camping out and hoping for prime spots. And some 200,000 people were flocking to a country music party in Nashville, Tennessee.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Samoa will be among the last to welcome 2025, a full 24 hours after New Zealand. (AP)

<img alt="Angelina Jolie filed to dissolve her marriage with Brad Pitt in September 2016, and the pair has remained locked in a court battle since.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Famed actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie signed off on a divorce settlement on Monday, according to US media, marking a turning point in the eight-year legal saga.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed the settlement to People Magazine, saying in a statement that Jolie was "focused on finding peace and healing for their family."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago," Simon said. "Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  No details of the settlement between the former power couple were immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jolie filed to dissolve their marriage in September 2016, and the pair has remained locked in a court battle since.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jolie filed for divorce a few days after a flight during which she alleged in court papers that Pitt "choked" one of their children and hit another during a plane fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the papers lodged in a Los Angeles court and widely quoted in US media, Jolie describes a lengthy eruption by Pitt as the couple flew with the children from California to France in September 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the ensuing years, the A-listers have clashed over custody of the children – three biological and three adopted – and more recently over the ownership of a luxury French property they bought together.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2018, the couple reached a custody arrangement for their six children, three of whom are adopted, though it appears to have since unravelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pitt and Jolie first got together after co-starring as married assassins in the 2005 film "Mr. and Mrs Smith." Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston at the time. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sydney welcomed 2025 with a massive fireworks display at its iconic harbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The self-proclaimed "New Year's capital of the world", sprayed nine tonnes of fireworks from its iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge at midnight, creating a spectacle that was awash with vibrant colours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said more than a million people gathered to watch the display as British pop star Robbie Williams led a singalong while Indigenous ceremonies and performances acknowledged the land's first people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Auckland became the first major city to ring in the new year, with thousands of revellers counting down to 2025 and cheering at colourful fireworks launched from New Zealand’s tallest structure, Sky Tower, and a spectacular downtown light show.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands also thronged to downtown or climbed the city’s ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point, and a light display recognising Auckland’s Indigenous tribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a year marked by protests over Māori rights in the nation of five million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Countries in the South Pacific Ocean are the first to ring in the New Year, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York. (Agencies)

 A flight attendant aboard a Swiss aircraft that made an emergency landing in Austria last week due to smoke in the cabin has died, the airline said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The flight from Bucharest to Zurich on December 23 was diverted to Graz after engine problems and smoke filled the cockpit and the cabin, Swiss International Air Lines said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the attendant died on Monday in intensive care in the hospital in Graz. The attendant was one of two crew members who were hospitalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 74 passengers aboard the Airbus A220-300 were evacuated after flight LX1885 landed safely, Swiss said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are devastated at our dear colleague’s death,” Swiss Chief Executive Officer Jens Fehlinger said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “His loss has left us all in the deepest shock and grief. Our thoughts are with his family, whose pain we cannot imagine. I offer them my heartfelt condolences on behalf of all of us at Swiss."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public prosecutor's office in Graz has ordered a forensic examination of the attendant's body, Austria's APA news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also appointed an aviation expert and initiated an investigation into the cause of the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the incident, Swiss said it was also conducting an internal examination.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We want to thoroughly clarify the causes of the smoke and the effects on passengers and crew,” the airline wrote on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The focus is on the mechanical parts of the aircraft, such as the engine, but also on the use of protective equipment for the cabin crew, known as Protective Breathing Equipment.” (AP)

    China says US Treasury hack claims are 'groundless'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Tuesday rejected accusations that a China state-sponsored actor was behind a cyber breach at the US Treasury Department, calling the claims "groundless".
 <br>
  <br>
  China denied the claims, with the Foreign Ministry saying Beijing "has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the US Treasury, the incident happened earlier this month, when the actor compromised a third-party cybersecurity service provider and was able to remotely access the workstations and some unclassified documents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Treasury contacted the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency after it was alerted of the situation by its provider BeyondTrust, and has been working with law enforcement to ascertain the impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The compromised BeyondTrust service has been taken offline and there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury systems or information," the department's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department did not provide further details on what was affected by the breach, but said more information would be released in a supplemental report at a later date.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds," the spokesperson added. (AFP)

<img alt="Investigators from South Korea and the US, including aircraft manufacturer Boeing, inspect the Jeju Air plane wreckage in Muan. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785658_1_20241231191117.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities on Tuesday said they were investigating the role of a concrete barrier at the end of Muan airport runway in the country's worst air disaster, which killed 179 people as a Jeju Air jet crashed on landing.
 <br>
  <br>
  US investigators, including from Boeing, were at the crash site in southwestern Muan, officials said, as South Korean authorities began assessing two black boxes retrieved from the burned-out wreckage of the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane was carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea when it made a mayday call and belly-landed before hitting the barrier and bursting into flames, killing everyone aboard except two flight attendants pulled from the burning wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting South Korean President Choi Sang-mok, who has only been in office since Friday, said the accident was a "turning point" for the country, calling for a full overhaul of air safety systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged officials to "thoroughly re-examine the overall aircraft operation system... and immediately address any necessary improvements."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials initially pointed to a bird strike as a possible cause, but experts have also flagged the barrier, with dramatic video showing the Boeing 737-800 bursting into flames as it collides with it.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether it was permissible for the airport to have used concrete in the barrier, director-general for airport policy Kim Hong-rak said the government would "review the relevant regulations and their application".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether this structure exacerbated the damage is... something the Accident Investigation Committee plans to investigate thoroughly," said deputy minister for civil aviation, Joo Jong-wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this stage, it is important to avoid focusing solely on any particular factor as the definitive cause of the accident," he said, adding investigators were reviewing "all potential scenarios to ensure a thorough investigation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air CEO Kim E-bae said that there were "no specific or unusual issues during the maintenance process" of the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for whether the landing gear functioned properly, that is directly related to the accident investigation, and we are not in a position to know at this time," he told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea is observing seven days of mourning over the disaster, with New Year celebrations cancelled and flags flying at half-mast. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court has issued an arrest warrant for impeached, suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol, investigators said on Tuesday, over his short-lived bid to impose martial law on the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule this month, plunging South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of his presidential duties by parliament over the action, but a constitutional court ruling is pending on whether to confirm the impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The arrest warrant and search warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol, requested by the Joint Investigation Headquarters, were issued this morning," the Joint Investigation Headquarters said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative leader faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators probing Yoon over his declaration of martial law requested the warrant on Monday after the suspended president failed to report for questioning a third time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reason for the warrant is that there is a concern that the individual may refuse to comply with summons without justifiable reasons, and there is sufficient probable cause to suspect the commission of a crime," a Corruption Investigation Office official told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The warrant is valid until January 6," the official said, adding that Yoon could be held at a police station or the Seoul detention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer called the arrest warrant for the impeached president "illegal and invalid", saying investigators lacked the authority to probe the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The arrest warrant and search and seizure warrant issued at the request of an agency without investigative authority are illegal and invalid," a statement from lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia and Ukraine swapped more than 300 prisoners of war on Monday in an exchange brokered by the United Arab Emirates ahead of New Year's Eve, officials from both countries said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have exchanged hundreds of captive soldiers since Russia began its military assault on Ukraine in February 2022, in one of the few areas of cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On 30 December, as a result of the negotiation process, 150 Russian servicemen were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. In return, 150 Ukrainian army prisoners of war were handed over," the Russian defence ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv received 189 people as part of the deal, including soldiers, border guards and two civilians from the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working to free everyone from Russian captivity. This is our goal. We do not forget anyone," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine said Monday that Moscow had released a total of 3,956 people - soldiers and civilians - in deals with Kyiv since the start of the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides said the latest exchange had been brokered by the United Arab Emirates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video published by Russia's human rights commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova showed soldiers gathered outside buses, wearing winter clothes and military fatigues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thank you for your service, patience and courage," Moskalkova said, wishing them a happy New Year's holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very soon our guys will embrace their relatives and friends and celebrate the New Year in their native land," she wrote in a Telegram message accompanying the video. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a jury verdict ordering US President-elect Donald Trump to pay US$5 million for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.
 <br>
  <br>
  A New York jury found after a nine-day civil trial last year that the former president had sexually abused Carroll at a Manhattan department store in 1996.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was ordered to pay US$2 million for sexual abuse and another US$3 million for defaming Carroll, a former advice columnist for Elle magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump denied the allegations and appealed the verdict on the grounds that two other women who said Trump had sexually assaulted them too should not have been allowed to testify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-judge panel of the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We conclude that Mr Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carroll was awarded US$83 million by another jury in a separate case she brought against Trump. He has also appealed that verdict. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday expressed "deep condolences" following the death of former US president Jimmy Carter, who died aged 100.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He has long made important contributions to promoting the development of Sino-US relations and friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two countries," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We express our deep condolences."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter normalised American relations with Beijing as Deng Xiaoping initiated the market reforms that led to unprecedented economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same year Deng -- often credited with China's "Reform and Opening" policy which led to its transformation -- met Carter in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter did not visit China during his presidency, but he made trips either side of his time in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president first travelled to China as a young naval officer in 1949.
  <br>
  <br>
  He visited the country in 1981, shortly after leaving office, meeting Deng and then-premier Zhao Ziyang in Beijing in 1987 and returned to China in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter visited again in July 1997, including several days in a small village in the eastern province of Shandong. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country's entire airline operation system as investigators worked to identify victims and find out what caused deadliest air disaster in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  All 175 passengers and four of the six crew were killed when a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 belly-landed and skidded off the end of the runway at Muan International Airport, erupting in a fireball as it slammed into a wall. Two crew members were pulled out alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top priority for now is identifying the victims, supporting their families and treating the two survivors, Choi told a disaster management meeting in Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even before the final results are out, we ask that officials transparently disclose the accident investigation process and promptly inform the bereaved families," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As soon as the accident recovery is conducted, the transport ministry is requested to conduct an emergency safety inspection of the entire aircraft operation system to prevent recurrence of aircraft accidents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport ministry said authorities were considering whether to conduct a special inspection of all 101 Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by South Korean airliners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air flight 7C2216, arriving from the Thai capital Bangkok with 175 passengers and six crew on board, was trying to land shortly after 9am on Sunday at the airport in the southwest of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators are examining bird strikes and weather conditions as possible factors in the crash, fire officials have said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts say many questions remain, including why the plane, powered by two CFM 56-7B26 engines, appeared to be travelling so fast and why its landing gear did not appear to be down when it skidded down the runway and into a wall.
  <br>
  <br>
  CFM International is a joint venture between GE Aerospace and France's Safran.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, transport ministry officials said as the pilots made a scheduled approach they told air traffic control the aircraft had suffered a bird strike, shortly after the control tower gave them a warning birds were spotted in the vicinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilots then declared mayday and signalled their intention to go around shortly before the aircraft came down on the runway in a belly landing and crashed into a structure at the end of the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials are investigating what role the wall at the end of the runway played in the crash, including the embankment on which it was standing, transport ministry officials told a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash killed mostly local residents who were returning from holidays in Thailand, while two Thai nationals also died.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday morning, investigators were trying to identify some of the last remaining victims, as anguished families waited inside the Muan airport terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Park Han-shin, who lost his brother in the crash, said he was told by authorities that his brother had been identified but has not been able to see his body.

  Park called on other victims' families to unite in responding to the disaster and recovery efforts, citing a 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people. Prolonged efforts to identify the victims and cause of the sinking followed that disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers were sifting through wreckage that was nearly completely destroyed when the aircraft was engulfed in an explosion of flames and debris at the regional airport near the country's winding western coastline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transportation ministry officials said the jet's flight data recorder was recovered but appeared to have sustained some damage on the outside and it was not yet clear whether the data was sufficiently intact to be analysed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Muan airport remains closed through Wednesday but the rest of the country's international and regional airports including the main Incheon International Airport near Seoul were operating as scheduled. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Investigators probing South Korea's Yoon Suk-yeol over his short-lived declaration of martial law on Monday said they sought an arrest warrant for the suspended president after he failed to report for questioning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule this month, plunging South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of his presidential duties by parliament over the action, but a constitutional court ruling is pending on whether to confirm the impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative leader also faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A former prosecutor himself, Yoon had been summoned three times by investigators for questioning, but refused to present himself each time -- including by yesterday's deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Joint Investigation Headquarters filed an arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk-yeol with the Seoul Western District Court", said the probe team in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The application by investigators marks the first attempt in the country's history to forcibly detain a president before the impeachment procedure is complete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is being investigated by prosecutors as well as a joint team comprising police, defence ministry, and anti-corruption officials. (AFP)

 Jimmy Carter "lived a life measured not by words, but by his deeds," President Joe Biden said on Sunday in televised remarks addressing the death of the former US leader.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden's tribute, like many that came in from US and global leaders, focused on Carter's character, with the outgoing president describing his predecessor as seeming to be from a "bygone era."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just look at his life, his life's work," Biden said, speaking from the US Virgin Islands, where he was on vacation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He worked to eradicate disease, not just at home, but around the world. He forged peace, advanced civil rights, human rights, promoted free and fair elections around the world. He built housing for the homeless with his own hands."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden also declared January 9 a national day of mourning for Carter, calling on Americans to visit their places of worship to "pay homage" to the late US leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I call on the American people to assemble on that day in their respective places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr," Biden said in a White House proclamation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the former US presidents, Bill Clinton said his predecessor had "worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world."
  <br>
  <br>
  George W. Bush said Carter "dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn't end with the presidency."
  <br>
  <br>
  Barack Obama hailed Carter for teaching "all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer paid tribute to Jimmy Carter for his "lifelong dedication to peace" and said the former US president had "redefined the post-presidency with a remarkable commitment to social justice and human rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Jimmy Carter served as US president when Ukraine was not yet independent but "his heart stood firmly with us in our ongoing fight for freedom".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply appreciate his steadfast commitment to Christian faith and democratic values, as well as his unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's unprovoked aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Cuba, the island's leader Miguel Diaz-Canel said on Sunday his nation would remember Carter "with gratitude".
  <br>
  <br>
  During his presidency, Carter made moves to normalise diplomatic ties and relax US sanctions on the country, and "our people will remember with gratitude his efforts to improve relations," Diaz-Canel said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Panama's President Jose Mulino said negotiations with Carter "achieved the transfer of the Canal to Panamanian hands and the full sovereignty of our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump, who will return to the White House in January, has threatened to demand the key waterway be returned to the United States, which originally completed and operated it. (AFP)

    Former US president Jimmy Carter dies, aged 100

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jimmy Carter, the earnest Georgia peanut farmer who as US president struggled with a bad economy and the Iran hostage crisis but brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday, the Carter Center said. He was 100.
 <br>
  <br>
  “My father was a hero, not only to me but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights, and unselfish love,” said Chip Carter, the former president’s son. “My brothers, sister, and I shared him with the rest of the world through these common beliefs. The world is our family because of the way he brought people together, and we thank you for honoring his memory by continuing to live these shared beliefs.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A Democrat, he served as president from January 1977 to January 1981 after defeating incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 US election. Carter was swept from office four years later in an electoral landslide as voters embraced Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, the former actor and California governor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter lived longer after his term in office than any other US president. Along the way, he earned a reputation as a better former president than he was a president - a status he readily acknowledged.
  <br>
  <br>
  His one-term presidency was marked by the highs of the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, bringing some stability to the Middle East. But it was dogged by an economy in recession, persistent unpopularity and the embarrassment of the Iran hostage crisis that consumed his final 444 days in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, Carter had experienced several health issues including melanoma that spread to his liver and brain. Carter decided to receive hospice care in February 2023 instead of undergoing additional medical intervention. His wife, Rosalynn Carter, died on Nov. 19, 2023, at age 96. He looked frail when he attended her memorial service and funeral in a wheelchair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter left office profoundly unpopular but worked energetically for decades on humanitarian causes. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 in recognition of his "untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter had been a centrist as governor of Georgia with populist tendencies when he moved into the White House as the 39th US president. He was a Washington outsider at a time when America was still reeling from the Watergate scandal that led Republican Richard Nixon to resign as president in 1974 and elevated Ford from vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm Jimmy Carter and I'm running for president. I will never lie to you," Carter promised with an ear-to-ear smile.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked to assess his presidency, Carter said in a 1991 documentary: "The biggest failure we had was a political failure. I never was able to convince the American people that I was a forceful and strong leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite his difficulties in office, Carter had few rivals for accomplishments as a former president. He gained global acclaim as a tireless human rights advocate, a voice for the disenfranchised and a leader in the fight against hunger and poverty, winning the respect that eluded him in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts to promote human rights and resolve conflicts around the world, from Ethiopia and Eritrea to Bosnia and Haiti. His Carter Center in Atlanta sent international election-monitoring delegations to polls around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher since his teens, Carter brought a strong sense of morality to the presidency, speaking openly about his religious faith. He also sought to take some pomp out of an increasingly imperial presidency - walking, rather than riding in a limousine, in his 1977 inauguration parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Middle East was the focus of Carter's foreign policy. The 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, based on the 1978 Camp David accords, ended a state of war between the two neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland for talks. Later, as the accords seemed to be unravelling, Carter saved the day by flying to Cairo and Jerusalem for personal shuttle diplomacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The treaty provided for Israeli withdrawal from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and establishment of diplomatic relations. Begin and Sadat each won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the 1980 election, the overriding issues were double-digit inflation, interest rates that exceeded 20% and soaring gas prices, as well as the Iran hostage crisis that brought humiliation to America. These issues marred Carter's presidency and undermined his chances of winning a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  On November 4, 1979, revolutionaries devoted to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had stormed the US Embassy in Tehran, seized the Americans present and demanded the return of the ousted shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was backed by the United States and was being treated in a US hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American public initially rallied behind Carter. But his support faded in April 1980 when a commando raid failed to rescue the hostages, with eight US soldiers killed in an aircraft accident in the Iranian desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter's final ignominy was that Iran held the 52 hostages until minutes after Reagan took his oath of office on January 20, 1981, to replace Carter, then released the planes carrying them to freedom.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another crisis, Carter protested the former Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by boycotting the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. He also asked the US Senate to defer consideration of a major nuclear arms accord with Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unswayed, the Soviets remained in Afghanistan for a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter won narrow Senate approval in 1978 of a treaty to transfer the Panama Canal to the control of Panama despite critics who argued the waterway was vital to American security. He also completed negotiations on full US ties with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter created two new US Cabinet departments - education and energy. Amid high gas prices, he said America's "energy crisis" was "the moral equivalent of war" and urged the country to embrace conservation. "Ours is the most wasteful nation on earth," he told Americans in 1977.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1979, Carter delivered what became known as his "malaise" speech to the nation, although he never used that word.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After listening to the American people I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world can't fix what's wrong with America," he said in his televised address.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America."
  <br>
  <br>
  As president, the strait-laced Carter was embarrassed by the behaviour of his hard-drinking younger brother, Billy Carter, who had boasted: "I got a red neck, white socks, and Blue Ribbon beer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jimmy Carter withstood a challenge from Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination but was politically diminished heading into his general election battle against a vigorous Republican adversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reagan, the conservative who projected an image of strength, kept Carter off balance during their debates before the November 1980 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reagan dismissively told Carter, "There you go again," when the Republican challenger felt the president had misrepresented Reagan's views during one debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter lost the 1980 election to Reagan, who won 44 of the 50 states and amassed an Electoral College landslide.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, one of four children of a farmer and shopkeeper. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1946, served in the nuclear submarine program and left to manage the family peanut farming business.
  <br>
  <br>
  He married his wife, Rosalynn, in 1946, a union he called "the most important thing in my life." They had three sons and a daughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter became a millionaire, a Georgia state legislator and Georgia's governor from 1971 to 1975. He mounted an underdog bid for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, and out-hustled his rivals for the right to face Ford in the general election.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Walter Mondale as his vice presidential running mate, Carter was given a boost by a major Ford gaffe during one of their debates. Ford said that "there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration," despite decades of just such domination.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter edged Ford in the election, even though Ford actually won more states - 27 to Carter's 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Not all of Carter's post-presidential work was appreciated. Former President George W. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush, both Republicans, were said to have been displeased by Carter's freelance diplomacy in Iraq and elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2004, Carter called the Iraq war launched in 2003 by the younger Bush one of the most "gross and damaging mistakes our nation ever made." He called George W. Bush's administration "the worst in history" and said Vice President Dick Cheney was "a disaster for our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2019, Carter questioned Republican Donald Trump's legitimacy as president, saying "he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf." Trump responded by calling Carter "a terrible president."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter also made trips to communist North Korea. A 1994 visit defused a nuclear crisis, as President Kim Il Sung agreed to freeze his nuclear program in exchange for resumed dialogue with the United States. That led to a deal in which North Korea, in return for aid, promised not to restart its nuclear reactor or reprocess the plant's spent fuel.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Carter irked Democratic President Bill Clinton's administration by announcing the deal with North Korea's leader without first checking with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2010, Carter won the release of an American sentenced to eight years hard labor for illegally entering North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter wrote more than two dozen books, ranging from a presidential memoir to a children's book and poetry, as well as works about religious faith and diplomacy. His book "Faith: A Journey for All," was published in 2018. (Reuters)

<img alt="Ahmed al-Sharaa is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist group that led the coalition that seized power in Damascus. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785401_1_20241230042017.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's leader Ahmed al-Sharaa told Al Arabiya on Sunday that elections could take four years, noting the importance of ties with Iran and Russia and calling for the United States to lift sanctions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The election process could take four years," Sharaa told the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television, three weeks after his Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and allied rebels ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to rewrite the constitution" which could take "two or three years", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the wide-ranging interview, he expressed hope that the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump would lift sanctions imposed on his now war-torn and impoverished country under Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sanctions on Syria were issued based on the crimes that the regime committed," Sharaa said, adding that since Assad was gone, "these sanctions should be removed automatically".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many governments including the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader also noted the importance of ties with Russia and Iran, which were both key allies of Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syria cannot continue without relations with an important regional country like Iran, but they must be based on respect for the sovereignty of both countries and non-interference in the affairs of both countries," Sharaa said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Russia is an important country and is considered the second most powerful country in the world," he said, noting the "deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria".
  <br>
  <br>
  "All Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts... We do not want Russia to leave Syria in the way that some wish," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa also said local Kurdish-led forces which Turkey opposes would be integrated into the national army.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Weapons must be in the hands of the state alone. Whoever is armed and qualified to join the defence ministry, we will welcome them," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on these criteria, "we will open a negotiations dialogue with the SDF, to perhaps find an appropriate solution," referring to the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria's north and northeast. (AFP)

    South Korea mourns after 179 die in Muan plane crash

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok, in an emergency meeting on Sunday evening, declared a national mourning period until January 4 over the plane crash at Muan International Airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Jeju Air passenger plane skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames after its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy. All but two of the 181 people on board died in one of the country’s worst aviation disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Ministry said the plane was a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800 jet that had arrived in the South Korean city from Bangkok and that the crash happened at 9.03 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 179 people - 85 women, 84 men and 10 others whose genders weren’t immediately identifiable - died in the fire, the South Korean fire agency said. Emergency workers pulled two people, both flight attendants, to safety. Health officials said they are conscious and not in life-threatening condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  A transport official said both black boxes - the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder - have been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised news conference, Kim E-bae, Jeju Air’s president, bowed deeply with other senior company officials as he apologised to bereaved families and said he felt “full responsibility” for the incident. Kim said the company hadn’t identified any mechanical problems with the aircraft following regular checkups and that he would wait for the results of government investigations into the cause of the incident.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The stench of gasoline hangs over Muan International Airport. Behind a police cordon, plane seats, suitcases and twisted bits of metal are scattered, close to the wrecked fuselage of Jeju Air flight 2216.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 carrying 181 people from Bangkok to South Korea crashed as it attempted an emergency landing on Sunday, smashing into a wall and bursting into flames, leaving all but two people aboard feared dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of emergency workers put out the fire and combed through the wreckage, but only two people, both flight attendants, were rescued alive, with 177 confirmed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  By late afternoon, floodlights illuminated the twisted wreckage as a huge yellow crane lifted the fuselage, allowing officials to continue the search and rescue mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Behind a police cordon tape stretched across the wire fence at the edge of the runway, plane seats and other chunks of metal could be seen, offering a glimpse into the catastrophic impact of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inside the airport terminal, family members gathered to wait for news, many looking stunned and tearful.
  <br>
  <br>
  One woman was carried away on a stretcher, apparently having passed out from shock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The boards typically used for arrival and departure information were instead displaying the names, dates of birth and nationalities of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a son on board that plane ... He has yet to be identified," one elderly man waiting in the airport lounge, who asked not to be named, told AFP
  <br>
  <br>
  Wailing and screaming echoed through the two-storey airport, as the names and identities of victims were confirmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the passengers, who were all Korean nationals except for two Thais, had been returning home after their winter holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My younger sister went to heaven today," one 65-year-old woman who gave only her surname Jo told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her sister had been in Bangkok with her friends on holiday, the woman, wearing a mask and a grey knit hat, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My husband is now trying to check whether she's been identified," Jo added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight had 175 passengers, including two Thai nationals, and six crew onboard.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to authorities, the youngest passenger was a three-year-old boy and the oldest was a 78-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the dead were children under the age of 10, authorities said, citing the passenger manifest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only sounds near the crash site were the whirring of cameras and the murmur of reporters broadcasting live, as hundreds of relatives, lost for words, awaited news of their loved ones aboard the burned plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the area around the runway, AFP reporters could see duty-free booklets and sanitary gloves worn by the flight crew scattered across the field, not far from the charred tail of the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the deadliest aviation accident on South Korean soil and the worst in years involving the country's carriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A moment of silence was held at sporting events, including volleyball and basketball games, on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  All major South Korean broadcasters changed their schedules to emergency news programming.
  <br>
  <br>
  End-of-the-year entertainment award shows and comedy shows were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident comes as South Korea is in the midst of political chaos, after suspended president Yoon Suk-yeol was impeached earlier this month over his ill-fated attempt to declare martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The acting president was also impeached on Friday, leaving the country with its third leader in three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civic groups said they were reviewing whether to postpone mass impeachment rallies in light of the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heartbreaking stories of family members were also shared online, with one saying his mother and his five aunts were one the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was told they would arrive around 8.50 am today, so I came to the airport to pick up my mother and aunts, but I've heard no word from them," he told local media anxiously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runway at Muan airport will be closed until later this week, authorities said, as investigators probe the cause of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  One heart-wrenching screenshot of the final Kakao Talk message exchange between a passenger and their family has been widely reported in local media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The message from the parent and passenger reads: "Wait, a bird is stuck in the wing. Unable to land now... Should I leave a will?"
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the last message, sent at 9.01 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their child replies: "Why can't I make a call with you?". It was delivered at 9.37 am and has remained unread.
  <br>

<img alt="Firefighters and rescuers work near the wreckage of a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 at Muan International Airport. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785363_1_20241229143707.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A passenger plane burst into flames on Sunday after it skidded off a runway at a South Korean airport and slammed into a concrete fence when its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy, killing at least 151 people, officials said, in one of the country's worst aviation disasters.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Fire Agency said rescuers raced to pull people from the Jeju Air passenger plane carrying 181 people at the airport in the town of Muan, about 290 kilometres south of Seoul. The Transport Ministry said the plane was a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800 jet that was returning from Bangkok and that the crash happened at 9.03 am. local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 124 people — 57 women, 54 men and 13 others whose genders weren’t immediately identifiable — died in the fire, the fire agency said. The death toll is expected to rise further as the rest of the people aboard the plane remain missing about six hours after the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers pulled out two people, both crew members, to safety, and local health officials said they remain conscious. The fire agency deployed 32 fire trucks and several helicopters to contain the fire. About 1,560 firefighters, police officers, soldiers and other officials were also sent to the site, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage of the crash aired by YTN television showed the Jeju Air plane skidding across the airstrip, apparently with its landing gear still closed, and colliding head-on with a concrete wall on the outskirts of the facility. Other local TV stations aired footage showing thick plumes of black smoke billowing from the plane, which was engulfed in flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jeong-hyeon, chief of the Muan fire station, told a televised briefing that the plane was completely destroyed, with only the tail assembly remaining recognizable among the wreckage. Lee said that workers were looking into various possibilities about what caused the crash, including whether the aircraft was struck by birds, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Ministry officials later said their early assessment of communication records show the airport control tower issued a bird strike warning to the plane shortly before it intended to land and gave its pilot permission to land in a different area. The pilot sent out a distress signal shortly before the plane went past the runway and skidded across a buffer zone before hitting the wall, the officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Transport Ministry official Joo Jong-wan said workers have retrieved the flight data recorder from the plane’s black box and are still looking for the cockpit voice recording device. He earlier said that government investigators arrived at the site to investigate the cause of the crash and fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency officials in Muan said the plane’s landing gear appeared to have malfunctioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Ministry said the plane's passengers include two Thai nationals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, expressed deep condolences to the families of those affected by the accident in a post on social platform X. Paetongtarn said she ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerati Kijmanawat, the director of the Airports of Thailand, confirmed in a statement that Jeju Air flight 7C 2216 departed from Suvarnabhumi Airport with no reports of abnormal conditions with the aircraft or on the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air in a statement expressed its “deep apology” over the crash and said it will do its “utmost to manage the aftermath of the accident.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised news conference, Kim E-bae, Jeju Air’s president, deeply bowed with other senior company officials as he apologised to bereaved families and said he feels “full responsibility” for the incident. Kim said the company hadn’t identified any mechanical problems with the aircraft following regular check-ups and that he would wait for the results of government investigations into the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing said in a statement on X it was in contact with Jeju Air and is ready to support the company in dealing with the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew,” Boeing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s one of the deadliest disasters in South Korea’s aviation history. The last time South Korea suffered a large-scale air disaster was in 1997, when a Korean Airline plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board. In 2013, an Asiana Airlines plane crash-landed in San Francisco, killing three and injuring approximately 200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday’s accident was also one of the worst landing mishaps since a July 2007 crash that killed all 187 people on board and 12 others on the ground when an Airbus A320 slid off a slick airstrip in Sao Paulo and collided with a nearby building, according to data compiled by the Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit group aimed at improving air safety. In 2010, 158 people died when an Air India Express aircraft overshot a runway in Mangalore, India, and plummeted into a gorge before erupting into flames, according to the safety foundation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident came as South Korea is embroiled into a huge political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol’s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment . Last Friday, South Korean lawmakers impeached acting President Han Duck-soo and suspended his duties, leading Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to take over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi ordered officials to employ all available resources to rescue the passengers and crew before he headed to Muan. Yoon’s office said his chief secretary, Chung Jin-suk, will preside over an emergency meeting between senior presidential staff later on Sunday to discuss the crash. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Jeju Air plane carrying 181 people from Bangkok to South Korea crashed on arrival Sunday, killing at least 120, emergency services said, with a bird strike and adverse weather conditions cited as likely causes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two survivors -- one crew and one passenger -- were plucked from the wreckage as part of an ongoing rescue operation, the national fire agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video shared by the local MBC broadcaster showed the Jeju Air plane landing at Muan International Airport's runway, with smoke streaming out from the engines, before the entire aircraft was quickly engulfed in flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of the accident is presumed to be a bird strike combined with adverse weather conditions. However, the exact cause will be announced following a joint investigation," Lee Jeong-hyun, chief of Muan fire station, said during a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee had earlier warned that "the tally could rise due to the critically injured".
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident took place at 9.03am local time (0003 GMT) on Sunday during the landing of Jeju Air Flight 2216, the Ministry of Land said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A total of 175 passengers -- including two Thai nationals -- and six crew members were onboard," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air apologised and vowed to do all it could to help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We at Jeju Air will do everything in our power in response to this accident. We sincerely apologise for causing concern," the airline said in a statement posted on its social media channels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting President Choi Sang-mok called for the mobilisation of all resources to save the passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All related agencies... must mobilise all available resources to save the personnel," he instructed officials in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi convened an emergency meeting with cabinet members to discuss rescue operations and response, his office said, adding that the acting president, who took office only on Friday, is on his way to Muan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, expressed deep condolences to the families of those affected by the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn said in a social media post that she had ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first fatal accident in the history of Jeju Air, one of South Korea's largest low-cost carriers, which was set up in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  On August 12, 2007, a Bombardier Q400 operated by Jeju Air carrying 74 passengers came off the runway due to strong winds at the southern Busan-Gimhae airport, resulting in a dozen injuries. (AFP, AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Norwegian police said an officer in his twenties and a suspect had died after an overnight shootout on Saturday in the Nordic nation where police rarely die in the line of duty.
 <br>
  <br>
  The last time a police officer was shot and killed in the line of duty in Norway dated back to 2004, according to the Norwegian news broadcaster NRK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's deadly shooting took place in Klepp near the city of Stavanger in southwest Norway, and also resulted in another officer being wounded, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The mission last night had the worst possible outcome. Two human lives have been lost and the police have lost a dear colleague," said police commissioner Marie Benedicte Bjornland in a statement on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the ultimate and most tragic consequence of police work," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had been alerted to reports of a threatening situation involving weapons after midnight on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two police officers and the suspected gunman in his forties, who was sitting in a car, were shot in the subsequent exchange of gunfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critically injured, one of the police officers and the suspected man died on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fatal shootings of police officers are extremely rare in Norway and the other Nordic nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very serious and tragic event that affects us all", said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store to NRK. (AFP)

 An Israeli military raid targeting Hamas militants has forced a major hospital in northern Gaza out of service and led to the detention of its director, the WHO and health officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The assault on Kamal Adwan Hospital has rendered the facility "useless", further worsening Gaza's severe health crisis, the Palestinian territory's health officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organisation said the operation had put the "last major health facility in north Gaza out of service."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Initial reports indicate that some key departments were severely burnt and destroyed during the raid," it added in a statement on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said 60 health workers and 25 patients in critical condition, including some on ventilators, reportedly remained in the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients in moderate to severe condition were forced to evacuate to the destroyed, non-functioning Indonesian Hospital, the UN health agency said, adding it was "deeply concerned for their safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry reported that Israeli forces had detained Kamal Adwan's director, Hossam Abu Safiyeh, along with several medical staff members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said Abu Safiyeh was held alongside its north Gaza chief, Ahmed Hassan al-Kahlout.
