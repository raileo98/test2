<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Aviation Administration said the helicopter company involved in the Hudson River crash in New York City on Thursday that killed all six people on board including three children was shutting down operations immediately.
 <br>
  <br>
  The chopper run by New York Helicopter Tours also lacked flight recorders, the National Transportation Safety Board also said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No video or camera recorders have been recovered from the Bell 206 helicopter, the NTSB said, and none of the equipment on it had recorded information that would help the investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Divers from the NYPD were continuing to search for parts of the helicopter, including the main rotor, gearbox, tail rotor and the tail boom, the safety agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said it was "analyzing airplane/helicopter hotspots nationwide" and it would hold a helicopter safety panel meeting on April 22 to discuss the findings.
  <br>
  <br>
  New York Helicopter Tours said on its website it was referring all requests for comment to the FAA and NTSB.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aircraft, whose passengers included a senior executive of Siemens AG, his wife and three children, had its last major inspection done on March 1, and had completed seven tour flights before the crash, according to federal investigators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Divers recovered the victims' remains as well as the pilot from the submerged helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four people were declared dead at the scene, while the remaining two died later after they were transported to nearby hospitals. (Reuters)

    Nobel literature laureate Vargas Llosa passes away

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, who enchanted readers with his intellectual rigor and lyrical prose for five decades and came close to being president of his country, has died aged 89.
 <br>
  <br>
  He passed away in the country's capital Lima surrounded by his family and "at peace," his son Alvaro Vargas Llosa, a well-known political commentator, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A leading light in the 20th century Latin American literature boom, Vargas Llosa won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2010 for works like "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter," "Death in the Andes," and "The War of the End of the World."
  <br>
  <br>
  But early on he abandoned the socialist ideas that were embraced by many of his peers, and his dabbling in politics and conservative views annoyed much of Latin America's leftist intellectual class.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1990, he ran for president of Peru, saying he wanted to save his country from economic chaos and a Marxist insurgency.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lost in the run-off to Alberto Fujimori, a then-unknown agronomist and university professor who defeated the insurgents but was later jailed for human rights crimes and corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frustrated by his loss, the writer moved to Spain but remained influential in Latin America, where he harshly criticized a new wave of strident leftist leaders led by then-Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his dozens of novels, plays and essays, Vargas Llosa told stories from various viewpoints and experimented with form -moving back and forth in time and switching narrators.
  <br>
  <br>
  His work crossed genres and established him as a foundational figure in a generation of writers that led a resurgence in Latin American literature in the 1960s.
  <br>
  <br>
  His books often examined the unnerving relationships between leaders and their subjects. "The Feast of the Goat" (2000) details the brutal regime of Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo, while "The War of the End of the World" (1981) tells the true story of a fanatical preacher whose flock dies in a deadly war with Brazil's army in the 1890s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born to middle-class parents in Arequipa, Peru, on March 28, 1936, Vargas Llosa lived in Bolivia and the Peruvian capital Lima. He later made a home in Madrid, but retained influence in Peru, where he wrote for newspapers about current events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vargas Llosa frequently drew from personal experience and his family, at times inserting characters based on his own life into his tales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 1970s, Vargas Llosa, a one-time supporter of the Cuban revolution, denounced Fidel Castro, maddening many of his leftist literary colleagues like Colombian writer and fellow Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1976, the two had a famous argument, throwing punches outside a theater in Mexico City. A friend of Garcia Marquez said Vargas Llosa was upset that the Colombian had consoled his wife during an estrangement but Vargas Llosa refused to discuss it. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian missiles struck the heart of the Ukrainian city of Sumy as people gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday, killing at least 34 people, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Images from the scene showed lines of black body bags on the side of the road, while more bodies were seen wrapped in foil blankets among the debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage also showed fire crews fighting to extinguish the shells of burned-out cars among the rubble from damaged buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dead included two children, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a statement. A further 117 people were wounded, including 15 children, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Only filthy scum can act like this - taking the lives of ordinary people,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on social media, he said the first strike hit buildings belonging to a city university, while the second exploded above street level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has yet to comment on the strike and it denied targeting civilians in previous attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, Russia's defence ministry accused Ukraine of having carried out two attacks on Russian energy infrastructure over the previous day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack on Sumy followed a deadly April 4 missile strike on Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih that killed some 20 people, including nine children.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes a day after Russia and Ukraine’s senior diplomats accused each other of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to the three-year war. (AP)

    Israel intensifies strikes across Gaza

<div class="itemFullText">
 A wave of Israeli strikes across Gaza on Sunday hit a hospital and other sites, killing at least 21 people, including children, as Israel vowed to expand its security presence in the small coastal strip.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pre-dawn strike on Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was the latest of several attacks on northern Gaza's last major hospital providing critical health care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital director Dr Fadel Naim said the emergency room, pharmacy and surrounding buildings were severely damaged, affecting over 100 patients and dozens of staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  One patient, a girl, died during the evacuation following an Israeli warning because staff were unable to provide urgent care, Gaza's Health Ministry said. Israel said it struck a Hamas command and control centre at the hospital. Hamas denied the allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al-Ahli Hospital is run by the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which condemned the attack, saying in a statement it happened on “Palm Sunday, the start of the Holy Week, the most sacred week of the Christian year.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Palm Sunday commemorates Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem, and worshippers in Gaza City marked it in a church whose gilded trim and intact walls were a contrast to the widespread debris elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours later Sunday, a strike on a car in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed at least seven people including six brothers, according to staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. The youngest brother was 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their father, Ibrahim Abu Mahadi, said his sons worked for a charity that distributes food to Palestinians. "For what sin were they killed?” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AP reporters saw the mangled, bloodied car as relatives wept over the bodies. Israel's military asserted that it killed the deputy head of a Hamas sniper cell.
  <br>
  <br>
  An airstrike Sunday afternoon hit a house in the urban Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, killing at least seven people including two women, according to the Indonesian hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said in a statement it had struck over 90 militant targets over the past 48 hours including command and control centres, tunnels and weapons. The military also said it had intercepted a projectile fired from Gaza. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping called for stronger cooperation with Vietnam in industrial and supply chains and wider collaboration in emerging fields, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi starts a three-nation tour of Southeast Asia this week, beginning his state visits with Vietnam from April 14 to 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also urged strengthening coordination and cooperation through regional initiatives such as the East Asia Cooperation and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, the ministry said, citing an article by the president published in Vietnam media.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called such efforts necessary to "inject more stability and positive energy into a chaotic and intertwined world".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism has no way out," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, maintain the stability of the global industrial and supply chains, and maintain the international environment for open cooperation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Xi said China welcomes more high-quality imports from Vietnam and encourages more Chinese enterprises to invest and start businesses in the Southeast Asian country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries should expand cooperation in emerging fields such as 5G, artificial intelligence and green development, the article said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit, planned for weeks, comes as Beijing faces 145 percent US duties, while Vietnam is negotiating a reduction of threatened US tariffs of 46 percent that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will visit Malaysia and Cambodia from April 15 to 18. He last visited Cambodia and Malaysia nine and 12 years ago, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's trip to Hanoi is his second in less than 18 months. The two are set to sign about 40 agreements in multiple sectors, Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Bui Thanh Son said on Saturday, noting Hanoi wanted to boost cooperation on railways, agricultural trade and the digital and green economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing is also seeking Vietnam's approval for its COMAC planes. (Agencies)

    Pennsylvania governor's residence set on fire

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 38-year-old man was in custody and will face attempted homicide and aggravated arson charges after setting a fire overnight at Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence, state authorities said at a press conference at the governor's mansion in Harrisburg on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, identified as Cody Balmer from Harrisburg, whose motive is still unknown, slipped over a fence around the property carrying homemade incendiary devices and evaded state troopers long enough to enter the residence, set it on fire and leave, said Pennsylvania police officials. He was apprehended shortly before the press conference on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  State police banged on the bedroom doors of Shapiro and his family around 2 am to evacuate them as local firefighters extinguished the blaze. No one was injured, although burn marks could be seen on parts of the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shapiro, a Democrat seen as a potential candidate for his party's presidential nomination in 2028, said at the press conference that FBI Director Kash Patel had spoken to him a few hours earlier and promised "all the resources of the federal government" in investigating the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The residence was set on fire hours after Shapiro posted a picture of his family's "seder" table as they celebrated the first night of the Jewish holiday of Passover, which is about going "from slavery into freedom," according to Shapiro.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempts to put on me by attacking us as they did here last night," he said on Sunday, vowing to continue his work for Pennsylvania without fear. Shapiro added that his family still planned to hold a second seder on Sunday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether the attack could have been a hate-motivated crime, Shapiro said he would defer to the findings from federal authorities and Pennsylvania's district attorney.
  <br>
  <br>
  A "multifaceted review in terms of security measures and the exact timeline of how it happened" will be carried out, said Lieutenant Christopher Paris, commissioner of the Pennsylvania state police. (Reuters)

 Donald Trump is in "excellent health," a White House doctor's assessment said on Sunday, after he underwent his first annual medical checkup since returning to the US presidency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump, 78, has repeatedly boasted about his own vigour since starting a second term, while mocking his 82-year-old Democratic predecessor Joe Biden as decrepit and mentally unfit for office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State," read a physician's letter shared by the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted only a few abnormalities that included minor sun damage to Trump's skin, as well as scarring on his right ear from a gunshot wound after he was shot at in an assassination attempt last July.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire had told reporters on Friday he felt "in very good shape" after his exam earlier that day at the Walter Reed military hospital in the Washington suburbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has been accused of a lack of openness about his health despite huge interest in the well-being of America's commander-in-chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said previously that presidential physician Sean Barbabella would give a readout of the physical and that "of course" it would provide the full report. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Russian strike on Ukraine's northeastern city of Sumy killed at least 32 people, including two children, and wounded dozens on Sunday, Kyiv said, in the deadliest attack in months.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine said Russia launched ballistic missiles on Sumy's city centre on Palm Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came two days after US envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Russia to meet its leader, Vladimir Putin and despite US President Donald Trump urging Moscow to end the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sumy lies close to the Russian border and has come under increasing attack in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of 13:40 (1040GMT), 31 people were killed, including 2 children," the service said on social media, adding that "84 people were injured, including 10 children."
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses reported seeing bodies covered in silver sheets strewn across the centre of the city, as well as a severely destroyed trolleybus, and rescuers working through the rubble of a building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers said the strike hit the city centre "right when there were many people on the street."
  <br>
  <br>
  They said people were wounded or killed "in the middle of the street, in cars, public transport, and in houses."
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the second Russian attack with a large civilian death toll this month as Trump voices some anger at Moscow for "bombing like crazy" in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky called on the world to put pressure on Russia to end the three-year war and called for a "strong response" from Europe and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Talking has never stopped ballistic missiles and bombs," Zelensky said, two days after Witkoff held hours-long talks with Putin in Saint Petersburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Enemy missiles hit an ordinary city street, an ordinary life: houses, educational institutions, cars on the street," he said on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has not yet commented on the strike. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States wants a nuclear agreement "as soon as possible", Iran said after rare talks on Saturday, as US President Donald Trump threatens military action if they fail to reach a deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who briefly spoke face-to-face with Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff during the indirect meeting in Oman, said the talks would resume next Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The American side also said that a positive agreement was one that can be reached as soon as possible but that will not be easy and will require a willingness on both sides," Araghchi told Iranian state television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At today's meeting, I think we came very close to a basis for negotiation... Neither we nor the other party want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions' sake, time wasting or talks that drag on for ever," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the White House said: "The discussions were very positive and constructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oman's foreign minister acted as intermediary in the talks in Muscat, Iran said. The Americans had called for the meetings to be face-to-face.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the negotiators also spoke directly for "a few minutes", Iran's foreign ministry said. It said the talks were held "in a constructive and mutually respectful atmosphere".
  <br>
  <br>
  The long-term adversaries, who have not had diplomatic relations for more than 40 years, are seeking a new nuclear deal after Trump pulled out of an earlier agreement during his first term in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Araghchi, a seasoned diplomat and key architect of the 2015 accord, and Witkoff, a real estate magnate, led the delegations in the highest-level Iran-US nuclear talks since the previous accord's collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two parties were in "separate halls" and "conveying their views and positions to each other through the Omani foreign minister", Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The process took place in a "friendly atmosphere", Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, weakened by Israel's pummelling of its allies Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, is seeking relief from wide-ranging sanctions hobbling its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran has agreed to the meetings despite baulking at Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign of ramping up sanctions and repeated military threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile the United States, hand-in-glove with Iran's arch-enemy Israel, wants to stop Tehran from ever getting close to developing a nuclear bomb.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no visible signs of the high-level meeting at a luxury hotel in Muscat, the same venue where the 2015 agreement was struck when Barack Obama was US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal earlier that the US position starts with demanding that Iran completely dismantle its nuclear programme -- a view held by hardliners around Trump that few expect Iran to accept.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries," Witkoff told the newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponisation of your nuclear capability," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks were revealed in a surprise announcement by Trump during a White House appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours before the talks began, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: "I want Iran to be a wonderful, great, happy country. But they can't have a nuclear weapon."
  <br>
  <br>
  Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's adviser Ali Shamkhani said Iran sought "a real and fair agreement".
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's meetings followed repeated threats of military action by both the United States and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it requires military, we're going to have military," Trump said Wednesday when asked what would happen if the talks fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2015 deal that Trump abandoned aimed to make it practically impossible for Iran to build an atomic weapon, while at the same time allowing it to pursue a civil nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, which insists its nuclear programme is only for civilian purposes, stepped up its activities after Trump withdrew from the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest International Atomic Energy Agency report said Iran had an estimated 274.8 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 percent, nearing the weapons grade of 90 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karim Bitar, a Middle East Studies lecturer at Sciences Po university in Paris, said the Iranian government's very survival could be at stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The one and only priority is the survival of the regime, and ideally, to get some oxygen, some sanctions relief, to get their economy going again, because the regime has become quite unpopular," he told AFP.

 The United States and Iran opened high-stakes talks on Tehran's nuclear programme on Saturday, with President Donald Trump threatening military action if they fail to produce a deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides entered "indirect" talks -- via an intermediary -- in the Omani capital Muscat, Iran's foreign ministry said. The Americans had called for the meetings to be face-to-face.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disagreement over the format indicated the task facing the long-term adversaries, who are seeking a new nuclear deal after Trump pulled out of an earlier agreement during his first term in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was leading the Iranian delegation while Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff headed the US team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our intention is to reach a fair and honourable agreement from an equal position," Araghchi said in a video posted by Iranian state TV.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 69 people were killed this week in unusually intense thunderstorms across eastern India's Bihar state and in neighbouring Nepal, officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bihar disaster authorities said at least 61 people had died in strong thunder and lightning storms on Thursday and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight more people were killed in neighbouring Nepal, disaster officials said, blaming "lightning strikes" on Wednesday and Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy rain was forecast to hit Bihar again on Saturday, according to the local India Meteorological Department office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, experts warned that climate change was fuelling an alarming increase in deadly lightning strikes in India, killing nearly 1,900 people a year in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lightning caused 101,309 deaths between 1967 and 2020, with a sharp increase between 2010 and 2020, a team of researchers led by Fakir Mohan University in the eastern state of Odisha said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A man facing the death penalty for committing two murders was executed by firing squad on Friday, the second such execution in the US state of South Carolina this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikal Mahdi, 42, was executed for the 2004 murder of 56-year-old James Myers, an off-duty police officer, and the murder of a convenience store employee three days earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement from the prison, "the execution was performed by a three-person firing squad at 6:01 pm (2201 GMT)," with Mahdi pronounced dead four minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tonight, the state of South Carolina executed him by firing squad -- a horrifying act that belongs in the darkest chapters of history, not in a civilized society," defence lawyer David Weiss said in a statement. "Mikal died in full view of a system that failed him at every turn -- from childhood to his final breath."
  <br>
  <br>
  Myers found Mahdi hiding in a garden shed at his home before Mahdi killed him and set the body on fire. Mahdi also pleaded guilty to murdering a convenience store clerk three days before he killed Myers.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Carolina gives its death row inmates a choice between lethal injection, the electric chair and the firing squad. Mahdi chose the firing squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first execution by firing squad in the United States in 15 years was carried out in South Carolina on March 7, when a man convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend's parents was put to death.
  <br>
  <br>
  A three-person squad of Department of Corrections volunteers opens fire on the condemned man, who is restrained in a chair with a hood over his head 15 feet (five meters) away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi had requested clemency from Governor Henry McMaster but South Carolina's Republican chief executive did not grant it, or any previous clemency petitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi's lawyers had argued that he had suffered his entire life. He was four when his mother fled her abusive husband, leaving the boy to be raised by his volatile mentally ill father, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Between the ages of 14 and 21, Mikal spent over 80 percent of his life in prison and lived through 8,000 hours in solitary confinement," his lawyers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They described Mahdi as "deeply remorseful and a dramatically different person from the confused, angry and abused youth who committed the capital crimes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi's execution was the 12th in the United States this year. There were 25 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of US executions since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 have been performed using lethal injection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alabama has carried out four executions using nitrogen gas, a method that has been denounced by United Nations experts as cruel and inhumane.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while three others -- California, Oregon and Pennsylvania -- have moratoriums in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump is a proponent of capital punishment and on his first day in office called for an expansion of its use "for the vilest crimes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Attorney General Pam Bondi announced last week that federal prosecutors would seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, charged with the high-profile December 4 murder in New York of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the US military base in Greenland, a Danish territory coveted by US President Donald Trump, has been fired for criticising Washington's agenda for the Arctic island.
 <br>
  <br>
  Colonel Susannah Meyers, who had served as commander of the Pituffik Space Base since July, was removed after reports she distanced herself and the base from US Vice President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark and its oversight of the territory during his visit two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties," the US Space Force said in a statement late Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement did not expand further, but US website Military.com said Meyers sent a March 31 email to all personnel at Pituffik "seemingly aimed at generating unity among the airmen and guardians, as well as the Canadians, Danes and Greenlanders who work there" following Vance's appearance."
  <br>
  <br>
  During his March 28 visit to the base, Vance told a press conference, "Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Nuuk and Copenhagen viewed the visit as a provocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on social media, "We are open to criticisms, but let me be completely honest, we do not appreciate the tone in which it's being delivered."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Greenland's new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a Facebook post that "the United States will not get Greenland. We don't belong to anyone else. We decide our own future."
  <br>
  <br>
  In her email, relayed to Military.com, Meyers wrote, "I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base."
  <br>
  <br>
  On X, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said, "Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meyers has been replaced by Colonel Shawn Lee, the US Space Force said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has insisted that Washington needs control of Greenland for national and international security and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it, causing tensions to soar between the United States and Denmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen traveled to Greenland last week, telling the United States that "you cannot annex another country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls show a vast majority of Greenland's 57,000 people want to become independent from Denmark but do not wish to become part of the United States. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump, who in January became the oldest person to assume the US presidency, underwent his first physical exam of his second term on Friday and said it went well, with results set to be released Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who turns 79 in June and likes fast food so much he staged a photo op at a McDonald's during his campaign last year, spent several hours being poked and prodded by the doctors at Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went, I think, well ... every test you can imagine, I was there for a long time, the yearly physical," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. "I think I did well. I think they're releasing the report on Sunday," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he took a cognitive exam and got all the answers right.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall I felt I was in very good shape. A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul and I took — I wanted to be a little different than Biden. I took a cognitive test and I don't know what to tell you other than I got every answer right," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The physical could offer the first clear look at Trump's condition since his ear was grazed by a bullet in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July.
  <br>
  <br>
  His campaign released a report by Ronny Jackson, Trump's former White House doctor and a Republican Congressman from Texas, saying the injuries were superficial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House typically determines what data will be released from a president's health exam and earlier in the day Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said results will be released as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is not compelled to release any information, and there is no template for the presidential exam. Trump released only limited information about his health during his presidential campaigns.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 2024 election, Trump drew sharp contrasts with his predecessor, Joe Biden, now 82, claiming he was younger and fitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House doctor in 2018, when Trump was serving his first term, said the president was in overall excellent health but needed to shed weight and start a daily exercise routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked on Friday if the medical team had suggested any changes to his habits, the president said that they had "a little bit", but did not elaborate further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump included a cognitive exam, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, as part of his physical during his first term, and his doctor later said he scored 30 out of 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden released detailed summaries of his physical exams while in office, but several books published in recent months have raised questions about his mental acuity in his final months in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mental ability and age of both Biden and Trump were in focus during last year's election campaign, especially after Biden's disastrous performance in a debate with Trump in June, and Trump's increasingly rambling speeches at rallies. (Reuters)

    Women, children killed in Israeli strikes: UN

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of Israeli air strikes on Gaza have killed "only women and children" after a ceasefire collapsed, the UN said, as an Israeli attack in the territory's south on Friday left a family of 10 dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  A UN rights office report also warned that expanding Israeli evacuation orders were resulting in the "forcible transfer" of people into ever-shrinking areas, raising "real concern as to the future viability of Palestinians as a group in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said it was looking into the attack that killed members of the same family in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, adding separately that it had struck about 40 "terror targets" across the territory over the past day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed its Gaza strikes on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, more than 1,500 people have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory to which Israel cut off aid more than a month ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten people, including seven children, were brought to the hospital as martyrs following an Israeli air strike that targeted the Farra family home in central Khan Yunis," civil defence spokesperson Mahmud Bassal said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced Israel, saying: "If this is not barbarism, I ask you, what is it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  And the UN decried the impact of the ongoing Israeli strikes, finding that "a large percentage of fatalities are children and women". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A subway tunnel under construction near Seoul collapsed on Friday, likely leaving two workers trapped at the site, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Fire Agency said authorities were mobilising 55 rescue workers and 18 vehicles to rescue possible victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The collapse happened at Gwangmyeong, a city just south of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's officials said authorities earlier withdrew workers from the construction site and stopped traffic around the area after receiving reports that a ventilation shaft at the site was at a risk of collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officials said it wasn't immediately known whether any workers re-entered the site. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top EU officials and Chinese leaders are due to hold their next summit marking 50 years of ties in China in July, a spokesperson for the European Council said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The European Union had announced plans for a summit in January, before US President Donald Trump took office and unleashed swingeing tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are coordinating with China to set a date for the meeting, which is expected to take place in China in the second half of July," said the official at the council, the body representing the EU's 27 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bloc faces a delicate balancing act, seeking to negotiate with an unpredictable ally in Washington to avoid tariffs and the need to diversify trading partners, with its bid to hold the line on its own trade concerns regarding China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Friday, President Xi Jinping urged the EU to join hands with Beijing in resisting "unilateral bullying", referring to sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heads of the EU's two main institutions – the council and the European Commission – have held regular summits with China's leadership. (AFP)

    Yoon in emotional exit from official residence

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol returned to his private home on Friday from the official residence after his removal from office, with crowds of supporters turning out to greet his motorcade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court upheld Yoon's impeachment last Friday, capping four months of unprecedented constitutional turmoil after his short-lived attempt to impose martial law in December sent shockwaves through Asia's fourth-largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea will now hold a snap election on June 3, and questions remain over whether Yoon might still play a role given how his impeachment appears to have deepened polarisation in society and stirred up his conservative supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds had gathered outside the gates of the official residence, where Yoon briefly stopped to hug and shake hands with supporters, some of whom were crying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ousted president has not been seen in public since he was released from prison on March 8 when a court cancelled his detention warrant in the criminal case against him. He did not attend the impeachment ruling by the Constitutional Court on April 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of his ruling party members and supporters have been seen visiting the official residence where Yoon reportedly discussed the upcoming election.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he left the official residence, Yoon donned a red baseball cap saying "Make Korea Great Again" given to him by a supporter, video footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now I will go back to being one of the people... and find a new way for the country and the people," Yoon said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his wife were driven in a motorcade from the official presidential residence to their private apartment in a 37-storey building in Seoul. The pet-loving couple will also take back more than 10 dogs and cats they own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 280 police were deployed around his private home on Friday ahead of the move, and Yoon is to be accompanied by a security detail of about 50 people, media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president still faces trial on a criminal charge of leading an insurrection, which is punishable by death or a life sentence if he is convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race to replace Yoon kicked off this week with nearly 20 hopefuls expected to contest for the candidacy of the conservative People Power Party that is in a fight to retain the presidency against a populist liberal who leads in the polls. (Reuters)

    Xi urges EU to join in opposing 'unilateral bullying'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping urged the European Union on Friday to join hands with China in resisting "unilateral bullying", in reference to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  As he met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday, Xi stressed the need for cooperation between the bloc and Beijing in weathering Trump's continual escalations in the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China and Europe should fulfil their international responsibilities... and jointly resist unilateral bullying practices," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This, he stressed, would not only "safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests, but also... safeguard international fairness and justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added there is no winner in a tariff war, and going against the world will only result in self-isolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said for more than 70 years, China has achieved development through self-reliance and does not fear unreasonable suppression.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added that no matter how the external world changes, China will remain confident and focused on running its own affairs well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez, in turn, said following the meeting in Beijing that tensions over trade should not impede cooperation between China and the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Spain and Europe have a significant trade deficit with China that we must work to rectify," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sanchez also said "we must not let trade tensions stand in the way of the potential growth of the relationship between China and Spain and between China and the EU".
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain buys about 45 billion euros of goods every year from China, its fourth-largest trading partner, but sells around 7.4 billion euros' worth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez's trip comes as the EU rethinks its global trading relationships in the face of turmoil caused by the US import duties announced last week that have sent world markets into a tailspin.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China blasted US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Friday as a "numbers game" that "will become a joke", as Beijing raised levies on US imports to 125 percent and said it would go no further.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement followed the US move to raise the "reciprocal tariffs" on Chinese imports to 125 percent, bringing the total to 145 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council's Customs Tariff Commission said the US imposition of excessively high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, goes against basic economic laws and common sense, and is nothing but unilateral bullying and coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission said even if Washington is to raise tariffs further, it would no longer make economic sense and ultimately go down as a joke in world economic history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given that it's already impossible for the Chinese market to accept US imports at the current tariff level, if the United States imposes further tariffs on Chinese products, China will ignore it," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's duties on Chinese products have "become a numbers game with no practical significance in economics", a spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 125 percent tariffs on US goods are up from 84 percent, and will take effect from Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry also said China has filed a lawsuit against the US with the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism following the latest American tariff hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The countermeasure by Beijing came after US President Donald Trump's latest escalation in a tit-for-tat trade war that he started by singling China out even as he hit a pause on additional tariffs for other countries. (Xinhua/AP)

    Trump levy looms larger for senders of small parcels

<img alt="People sending small parcels to the US will have to pay US$100 per item from May 2 and US$200 from June 1.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is continuing to see fallout from the trade war started by US President Donald Trump who raised the duty on small goods parcels from the SAR to 120 percent from the 90 percent that he had set just a day before that, and the 30 percent in his opening salvo on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the amendment in an executive order that went public on Thursday Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tariffs on parcels will go up from US$75 to US$100 from May 2 and from US$150 to US$200 from June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in tariffs closes a trade exemption rule known de minimis that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to enter the United States free of duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  It means people wanting to send small parcels worth up to US$800, which are currently exempt from any duties, to the US from the mainland, Hong Kong or Macau will now have to pay US$100 per item posted between May 2 and before June 1 and US$200 for goods sent after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The skyrocketing increase in duties comes as the number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of these packages now enter under the de minimis rule, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in duties on small goods parcels has been framed by Trump as a solution to the national emergency arising from the US trade deficits and in his starting a tit-for-tat trade war that has seen him levy a punitive 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has said no one wins in a trade war and described the tariffs as protectionist.

 Recovery efforts wrapped up in the capital of the Dominican Republic after a roof collapse at a nightclub during a concert killed at least 221 people, authorities said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As families continue to mourn their loved ones, the cause of the catastrophe and the exact number of people who attended the fateful event have not yet been determined by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sudden collapse at the Jet Set club in Santo Domingo after midnight on Tuesday marred a concert by merengue singer Rubby Perez where politicians, athletes and other prominent local figures had gathered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today the search, rescue and recovery of victims ended," presidential spokesperson Homero Figueroa said in a video the government posted on social media. "Now it is time to move on to another phase, that of understanding and explaining what happened."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dominican government has approved creating a team of national and international experts to clarify the causes of the roof collapse at the popular venue, Figueroa said in the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency teams, that were on site until Thursday morning, pulled nearly 200 survivors from the building in the hours following the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Manuel Mendez, head of the country's emergency operations center (COE), said, "This is the hardest task I've had in my 20 years of leading the COE," breaking down in tears.
  <br>
  <br>
  After recovery efforts ended, the families of those missing left the area surrounding the nightclub, where they had stood for days embracing each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez, the singer, was among those killed in the crush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominican President Luis Abinader attended his funeral on Thursday, with a public memorial service for him set to follow later in the day. (Reuters)

<img alt="Britain's Defence Secretary John Healey and France's Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu attend a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing, hosted by the United Kingdom and France at Nato headquarters in Brussels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's defence minister on Thursday urged his counterparts from around 30 countries to press ahead with plans to deploy troops to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia, as questions remained over whether the United States would provide backup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairing the first defence ministers' meeting of the Coalition of the Willing, UK Defence Secretary John Healey said its members must ensure "that we’re fully prepared for the moment a peace agreement is reached.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must be ready for when that peace comes. That’s why the work of this coalition is so vital," Healey said at Nato headquarters in Brussels. He added that 200 military planners have been developing plans to deepen European involvement in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on social media, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said that “Ukraine is ready for peace - one that is just and backed by strength.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian government officials and military analysts have said that Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in Ukraine in the coming weeks to maximise pressure on Kyiv and strengthen the Kremlin’s negotiating position in ceasefire talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As usual with coalition gatherings, the United States did not take part. The success of the coalition’s operation hinges on US backup with airpower or other military assistance, but the Trump administration has made no public commitment to provide support.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland underlined the “crucial” role of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, representatives from around 50 nations will gather at Nato to drum up military support for Ukraine. That meeting will be chaired by Britain and Germany. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to join the meeting via video from Washington. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people, including three children, were killed after a sightseeing helicopter crashed into the Hudson River in New York on Thursday, sparking a major water rescue operation, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The crash killed all those onboard the aircraft: the pilot and a family from Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the victims were initially taken to a hospital, but later succumbed to their injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this time, all six victims have been removed from the water. And sadly, all six victims have been pronounced deceased," Mayor Eric Adams told a briefing, after earlier calling it a "heartbreaking and tragic crash."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chopper's landing skids were seen protruding from the river beside a tunnel vent as several boats clustered around the impact site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police from both New York and New Jersey, which is on the opposite side of the river from Manhattan, responded to the scene along with fire department vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBC4 channel reported that its own helicopter was unable to take off because of weather conditions, with the weather in New York on Thursday gusty under thick cloud cover.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses told the outlet that a rotor blade had come loose from the aircraft, while footage on social media showed pieces of the aircraft breaking off and the helicopter plunging into the waterway.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A Bell 206 helicopter crashed and is submerged in the Hudson River in New York City," the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate."
  <br>
  <br>
  New York City Police commissioner Jessica Tisch said the helicopter took off around 3 pm, flying south before heading up the Manhattan shoreline to the George Washington Bridge turning back towards the downtown Manhattan heliport, losing control and hitting the water near a Hoboken pier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police commissioner said the aircraft was operated by New York Helicopter which did not respond to a request for comment but lists the Bell 206 among its fleet. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several American senators have called for an investigation into whether US President Donald Trump engaged in insider trading or market manipulation by encouraging people to buy stocks just before his dramatic reversal on global tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Who in the administration knew about Trump's latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public's expense?" California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff posted on X on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm writing to the White House – the public has a right to know," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee wrote on X that "the President of the United States is literally engaging in the world's biggest market manipulation scheme."
  <br>
  <br>
  The accusations came as Trump posted a few minutes after Wall Street opened that "IT'S TIME TO BUY".
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours later, he announced a 90-day suspension of additional tariffs against dozens of countries, with the exception of China, triggering a historic stock market rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  After several days of collapse, the Dow Jones index ended Wednesday up 7.87 percent, its biggest gain since 2008, and the Nasdaq up 12.16 percent, the most since 2001.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also signed his post on Truth Social with the letters "DJT" – both his initials and the stock market abbreviation for his media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The company's shares closed the day up 21.67 percent. (AFP)

 US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order lifting water-pressure restrictions on showerheads, a move the White House said would "make America's showers great again".
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long complained about inadequate water pressure in American bathrooms, which he blames on federal water-conservation regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In my case I like to take a nice shower, to take care of my beautiful hair," Trump said as he signed the order in the Oval Office on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to stand under the shower for 15 minutes till it gets wet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It comes out drip, drip, drip. It's ridiculous."
  <br>
  <br>
  The order directs the Energy Department to roll back "radical green" regulations limiting the flow of showerheads to 9.5 litres of water per minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the order "frees Americans from excessive regulations that turned a basic household item into a bureaucratic nightmare" and ends the "Obama-Biden war on showers".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has targeted water-pressure standards for showerheads, toilets, dishwashers and other household appliances, since his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My hair, I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect, perfect," he said outside the White House in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I take a shower, I want that beautiful head of hair to be just lathered," Trump said in Detroit in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I get this best stuff you can buy and I dump it all over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then I turn on the water and the damn water drips out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't get the stuff out of my hair. It's a horrible thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  But according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, "shower head standards save consumers money on their water and energy bills and help the environment".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Testing has repeatedly shown that today's models can provide an excellent shower," the NGO said in a 2024 report. (AFP)

<img alt="Data centres' global electricity consumption has increased by 12 percent annually over the past five years.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Electricity consumption by data centres will more than double by 2030, driven by artificial intelligence applications that will create new challenges for energy security and CO2 emission goals, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, AI can unlock opportunities to produce and consume electricity more efficiently, the agency said in its first report on the energy implications of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data centres represented about 1.5 percent of global electricity consumption in 2024, but that has increased by 12 percent annually over the past five years. Generative AI requires colossal computing power to process information accumulated in gigantic databases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together, the United States, Europe, and China currently account for about 85 percent of data centre consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big tech companies increasingly recognise their growing need for power. Google last year signed a deal to get electricity from small nuclear reactors to help power its part in the artificial intelligence race.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the current rate, data centres will consume about three percent of global energy by 2030, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the IEA, data centre electricity consumption will reach about 945 terawatt hours by 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is slightly more than Japan's total electricity consumption today. AI is the most important driver of this growth, alongside growing demand for other digital services," said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  One 100 megawatt data centre can use as much power as 100,000 households, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it highlighted that new data centres, already under construction, could use as much as two million households. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, widely seen as the frontrunner in a presidential by-election triggered by the removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol last week, officially announced a presidential bid on Thursday, vowing to heal a starkly divided nation through economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, led the liberal Democratic Party’s campaign to oust the former president over his December declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee recently stepped down as the party’s chairman to focus on campaigning for the June 3 election. He is considered the clear frontrunner in party's primary. Kim Dong-yeon, the Democratic governor of Gyeonggi province and a longtime financial policymaker, also told reporters on Wednesday that he intends to run for president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s downfall has left the conservative People Power Party in disarray, with roughly 10 politicians expected to seek the nomination, reflecting a split between Yoon loyalists, who still control the party’s leadership, and reformists calling for a fresh start.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video message, Lee said that Yoon’s martial law saga exposed the country’s deep divisions and social conflicts, and argued that the root cause was a widening rich-poor gap. He promised aggressive government spending to jolt economic growth and ease income polarisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have more than we did in the past, but wealth is too concentrated in certain areas,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With economic growth rates declining worldwide, it has become difficult to maintain and develop an economy solely on the strength of the private sector. However, with government-led talent development and extensive investments in technological research and development, we can revive the economy.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said it was crucial to maintain a robust alliance with the United States and to pursue three-way cooperation with Japan, but he stressed that South Korea’s national interest should come first in “every decision”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who has served as a lawmaker, provincial governor and city mayor, is adored by supporters for his outspoken style and has long positioned himself as an anti-elitist.
  <br>
  <br>
  His critics view him as a populist who stokes division and demonises conservative opponents, while failing to offer realistic funding plans to achieve his ambitious goals. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dominican Republic rescue workers ended the search for survivors of a nightclub roof collapse as the death toll surpassed 180 in the Caribbean nation's worst disaster in decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel late on Wednesday reported 60 more deaths compared to the morning's count, with the total confirmed tally reaching 184.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official statement had earlier said that "all reasonable possibilities of finding more survivors" had been exhausted, and the focus of the operation will turn to recovering bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we will complete the rescue effort," said Jose Luis Frometa Herasme, head of the fire service in the Dominican capital Santo Domingo, where the tragedy ocurred at the Jet Set nightclub in the early hours of Tuesday, sending shockwaves through the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives of missing people were still waiting desperately for news on Wednesday of their loved ones outside the ruined club, at hospitals and at the local morgue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 300 rescue workers, aided by sniffer dogs, had spent two days combing through mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets, supported by firefighters from Puerto Rico and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial images of the site showed a scene resembling the aftermath of an earthquake, with a gaping hole where the roof of the club – a fixture of Santo Domingo's nightlife for half a century – had been.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 500 people were also injured when the roof caved in while renowned merengue singer Rubby Perez was performing for a crowd of hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez and two former Major League Baseball players were among the dead.
  <br>

<img alt="Mark Carney and his wife Diana Fox are targeted because of a photograph showing them with Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799735_1_20250410115043.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is leaning into his banking background as his country fights a trade war with the United States, but his financial ties have also made him a target for conspiracy theories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Incorporating tropes familiar to followers of the far-right QAnon movement, conspiratorial social media posts about the Liberal leader have surged ahead of the country's April 28 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Posts range from false claims he recited a "satanic chant" at a campaign event to AI-generated images of him in a pool with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the ideal person to be targeted here, for sure, due to his background, as well as his financial work," said Ahmed Al-Rawi, an associate professor of communications at Canada's Simon Fraser University.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before serving as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, Carney had a lucrative career as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mentioning a candidate's affiliation with the global financial elite, and particularly the World Economic Forum, has become a dog whistle for the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Conservatives have leapt to highlight Carney's connections to the annual gathering in Davos, with party leader Pierre Poilievre in January describing him as "the voice for the billionaire globalist elite that have been impoverishing the working class around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-establishment sentiment is present on the left, but Al-Rawi noted people trying to associate Carney with a supposed circle of nefarious elites were "mostly far-right players and provocateurs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many posts have zeroed in on a picture from a festival in Britain showing Carney and his wife standing next to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  This 2013 photo is authentic, but it precipitated the spread of several AI-generated images shared to emphasize a supposed link between Carney and Epstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian Digital Media Research Network found a small number of bot accounts pushed the association by replying to posts from Canadian political figures. Once larger accounts began to engage with the claims, millions of views rolled in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al-Rawi said for conspiracy theorists, a grain of truth mixed with fabricated evidence is enough for a claim to truly take hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman with the Carney campaign said the claims being spread were "false and disinformation" and said any insinuated connection with Maxwell was incorrect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She went to high school with Mark Carney's wife's sister," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although they may have bumped into each other in public settings, they are not friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts said engagement with the claims appears to be somewhat contained to groups already critical of Carney's Liberal Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carmen Celestini, an assistant professor in religious studies at the University of Waterloo, said the push appears to be building on attacks that were successful in hitting Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just sort of makes sense to move those conspiracy theories towards Carney," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls indicate that Carney's replacement of Trudeau coincided with a surge in Liberal support. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lego has opened a US$1 billion factory in Vietnam that it says will make toys without adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere by relying entirely on clean energy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The factory, which opened on Wednesday in an industrial area close to Ho Chi Minh City, is the first in Vietnam that aims to run entirely on clean energy. Lego says it will do that by early 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the Danish company's sixth worldwide and its second in Asia. It will use high-tech equipment to produce colourful Lego bricks for Southeast Asia’s growing markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We just want to make sure that the planet that the children inherit when they grow up needs to be a planet that is still there,” Lego CEO Niels Christiansen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The factory is an important factor in Lego's quest to stop adding greenhouse gases by 2050. It has a shorter-term target of reducing emissions by 37 percent by 2032.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privately-held group, which currently makes its bricks out of oil-based plastic, says it has invested more than US$1.2 billion in a search for more sustainable alternatives. But those efforts have not always been successful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vietnam also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, so it needs more of its factories to use clean energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country hopes the plant’s 12,400 solar panels and energy storage system will help set a precedent for more sustainable manufacturing. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has backtracked on emergency food aid cuts it announced for 14 countries, restoring assistance to six of them, the UN's World Food Program said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The UN agency, already struggling with financing woes, said on Monday that the United States advised it that Washington was eliminating emergency food aid to those 14 poor and otherwise troubled countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WFP said the cuts amounted to a "death sentence" for millions of hungry or starving people.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the United States has now reversed course and said it will continue sending food aid to Somalia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Ecuador, a WFP program official told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, with aid now cut off for the other eight countries, "hunger will deepen, millions of lives will be lost, entire regions will be destabilized," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  These eight countries are Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, Yemen, Chad, Mali, Nigeria and Madagascar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has largely gutted USAID, the main US humanitarian assistance organisation. It previously had a yearly budget of US$42.8 billion, which was 42 percent of all aid money disbursed around the world. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel said on Wednesday its troops were seizing "large areas" in Gaza and making the Palestinian territory "smaller and more isolated", as an air strike on a residential block killed at least 23 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz's comments come weeks into a renewed offensive by the military on the war-battered territory, which has displaced hundreds of thousands, while an aid blockade has revived the spectre of famine for its 2.4 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said that France plans to recognise a Palestinian state in the "coming months", a move that risks antagonising Israel which insists such moves by foreign states are premature.
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz said that "large areas are being seized and added to Israel's security zones, leaving Gaza smaller and more isolated", during a visit to the newly announced Morag Corridor between the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Yunis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz emphasised that Israel would keep increasing pressure on Gaza "until the hostages are freed and Hamas is defeated".
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz also said that Israel was encouraging plans for "voluntary emigration... in accordance with the vision of the US president, which we are working to implement".
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump had earlier this year proposed a plan to develop Gaza into a "Riviera of the Middle East" while displacing its population elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency meanwhile said an Israeli air strike on a residential building in Gaza City killed at least 23 people, most of them children or women, while the military said it targeted a "senior Hamas" militant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed intense strikes on Gaza on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. Efforts to restore the truce have so far failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said on Wednesday that at least 1,482 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed Israeli operations, taking the overall death toll since the start of the war to 50,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 2023 attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians. (AFP)

    France cuts growth forecast for 2025 on tariff fears

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The French government has cut its growth forecast for 2025 because of the uncertainty over world trade, the economy minister said on Wednesday just hours after US President Donald Trump paused a massive hike in tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government had forecast annual growth of 0.9 percent when presenting its 2025 budget, but Economy Minister Eric Lombard told TF1 television that it would be trimmed to 0.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bank of France had already revised its growth forecast for 2025 to 0.7 percent in March, and the French Economic Observatory (OFCE) lowered its forecast to 0.5 percent on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about a possible further downward revision, the minister said that "would depend on the negotiations that will be initiated with the United States and the decisions that are taken on customs duties."
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we succeed in lowering tariffs, we could even get better, and if not, we will see," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lombard ruled out raising taxes in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before his interview, Trump announced that he was suspending levies on all countries except China for three months, after US bond and equity markets had tumbled for several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's good news, but we must remain calm," Lombard told LCI television, saying he hoped to find "a new agreement" with the Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau welcomed the US move which he called "a return to economic realism and a little reality". But he warned that US policy remained "unpredictable" and that there would be a "negative impact" in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy, which exports much more to the US than France, earlier in the day halved its growth forecast for 2025 to 0.6 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Relatives of people trapped under the rubble of a Dominican Republic nightclub that collapsed, killing over 120, waited anxiously for news on Wednesday as hopes of finding their loved ones alive began to fade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The disaster at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo sent shockwaves through the Caribbean nation, a major tourism destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 124 people were killed and over 500 injured when the club's roof caved in while renowned Dominican merengue singer Rubby Perez was performing for a crowd of hundreds in the early hours of Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez himself died in the calamity, as well as two former Major League Baseball players among the party-goers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of relatives gathered outside the club, hospitals and the city morgue on Wednesday, clamouring for news as forensic teams continued to identify the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 300 rescue workers continued combing through mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets, supported by firefighters from Puerto Rico and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial images of the site showed a scene resembling the aftermath of an earthquake, with a gaping hole where the club's roof had been.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Manuel Mendez, director of emergency operations, said rescue crews still had "24 to 36 hours of work left" to find survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hope is the last thing we lose," he said. (AFP)

    Trump pauses tariffs for 90 days but hits China harder

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump abruptly backed down on Wednesday in his global trade war with a 90-day pause for most countries – but slapped even more levies against China in what has become a full-scale confrontation between the world's two largest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Following days of global market turmoil, Wall Street stocks surged in reaction to Trump's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have authorized a 90-day PAUSE" on higher tariffs that took effect on Wednesday, Trump said on his Truth Social network, saying he took the decision after more than 75 countries had reached out to negotiate and did not retaliate against the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a flat rate of 10 percent tariffs on all countries that took effect on Saturday will remain in place. This marked a stunning reverse from often punishing levies that hit even many of the closest US allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump accused China of still "ripping off" his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 percent, effective immediately," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had only hours earlier ramped up the duties on Chinese goods to a giant 104 percent. China then retaliated by raising tariffs on US imports to 84 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable," Trump said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU on Wednesday adopted its first measures hitting back at US President Donald Trump's tariffs, targeting more than 20 billion euros of US products including soybeans, motorcycles and beauty products.
 <br>
  <br>
  "These countermeasures can be suspended at any time, should the US agree to a fair and balanced negotiated outcome," the European Commission said in a statement issued after EU member states greenlit the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies are retaliation for US duties on steel and aluminium imposed last month – with Europe's response to Trump's latest tariffs salvo yet to be announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duties will start to be collected under the measures on April 15, the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EU considers US tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels stressed it wanted a deal that "would be balanced and mutually beneficial".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also slapped a 25-percent tariff on car imports from the EU, and targeted the bloc with so-called reciprocal tariffs of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  An EU spokesman said its response to those measures could be unveiled as early as next week. (AFP)

 Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on a residential building in the Shujaiya area of Gaza City killed at least 20 people on Wednesday, as the military said they were looking into the attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency's spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the strike resulted in "20 martyrs and more than 40 injured" and the search for bodies in the rubble was ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed intense strikes on the Gaza Strip on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. Efforts to restore the truce have so far failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said on Wednesday that at least 1,482 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed Israeli operations, taking the overall death toll since the start of the war to 50,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  An October 2023 attack by Hamas that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hossam Badran, a member of Hamas's political bureau, said on Tuesday that it was "necessary to reach a ceasefire" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "communication with the mediators is still ongoing" but that "so far, there are no new proposals".
  <br>
  <br>
  Badran said Hamas "is open to all ideas that would lead to a ceasefire and stop the genocide enacted against our Palestinian people".
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that new negotiations were in the works aimed at getting more hostages released from captivity in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack on Israel, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. (AFP)

    Hezbollah 'ready for talks on disarmament'

<img alt="Israeli military exhibit seized Hezbollah weapons, without specifying when and where they were confiscated, near the border with Lebanon last year. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799628_1_20250409180051.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 As calls for Lebanon's Hezbollah to disarm gain momentum, a senior official from the group said it is ready to hold talks with the Lebanese president about its weapons if Israel withdraws from south Lebanon and stops its strikes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The prospect of talks aimed at securing Hezbollah's disarmament – unimaginable when it was at the zenith of its power just two years ago – underlines dramatic shifts in the Middle East power balance since Israel pummelled the Iran-backed group in a devastating conflict triggered by the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US-backed President Joseph Aoun, who vowed when he took office in January to establish a state monopoly on the control of arms, intends to open talks with Hezbollah over its arsenal soon, three Lebanese political sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hezbollah emerged severely weakened from the 2024 conflict with Israel when its top leaders and thousands of its fighters were killed and much of its rocket arsenal destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blow was compounded when its ally Bashar al-Assad was toppled from power in Syria, cutting its supply lines from Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The senior Hezbollah official said the group was ready to discuss its arms in the context of a national defence strategy but this hinged on Israel pulling out its troops from five hilltops in south Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hezbollah is ready to discuss the matter of its arms if Israel withdraws from the five points, and halts its aggression against Lebanese," the senior official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel, which sent ground troops into south Lebanon during the war, has largely withdrawn but decided in February not to leave the five hilltop positions. It said it intended eventually to hand them over to Lebanese troops once it was sure the security situation allowed. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China-US economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial and win-win in nature, and cooperation benefits both sides while confrontation harms both, said a white paper released by the State Council Information Office on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maintaining the stable development of China-US economic and trade relations is in the fundamental interest of both nations and peoples, which is also conducive to global economic development, according to the white paper titled "China's Position on Some Issues Concerning China-US Economic and Trade Relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of the white paper came on the same day steep US tariffs of 104 percent for Chinese goods came into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the document, Beijing and Washington can resolve differences in economic and trade areas through equal-footed dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equal-footed dialogue should constitute the fundamental approach in addressing problems between major countries, the white paper said, adding that mutually beneficial cooperation can help the two countries realise their respective development goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The white paper noted the world anticipates China-US cooperation to generate more development opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the document, the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will damage its own and others' interests, and is a severe violation of World Trade Organization rules that damages the multilateral trading system and erodes the legitimate rights and interests of the parties affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said tariffs will increase inflationary pressure in the United States, weaken its industrial base, aggravate panic in the financial market and increase the risk of US economic recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "History has repeatedly taught the lesson that trade protectionism will not help strengthen a country's domestic economy," the white paper said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, it will do severe damage to world trade and investment, which could trigger a global economic and financial crisis, with the inevitable consequences for oneself and others." (Reporting by Xinhua)

<img alt="Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer (right) welcomes President of the Comcast Corporation Mike Cavanagh to Downing Street, London.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US media giant Comcast Corp will build its first Universal theme park and resort in Europe in Bedford, north of London, opening in 2031, the British government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The park will create 20,000 jobs during construction and a further 8,000 jobs across the hospitality and creative industries when it opens, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is expected to attract 8.5 million visitors in its first year, a number currently only exceeded in Europe by Disneyland Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universal Studios has five resorts and parks in the US states of California and Florida as well as in Singapore, Japan and China, offering rides and attractions based on Jurassic Park, Harry Potter and other movie franchises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has sought to ease planning demands to boost investment in Britain, said in a statement the multi-billion pound investment would make Bedford home to one of the biggest entertainment parks in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plans for the site include a theme park, featuring several themed lands, a 500-room hotel and a retail, dining and entertainment complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast President Mike Cavanagh showed Starmer the plan in London on Tuesday, saying he "could not be more excited" to create a Universal theme park and resort in the heart of the United Kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast bought a 500-acre former brickworks in Bedfordshire, about 55 miles north of London, in 2023. It already owns Sky, which is Europe's biggest pay-TV business.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had been in talks with the British government since last year about turning the site into a theme park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park and resort are subject to planning permission, the government said. (Reuters)

<img alt="White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal over tariffs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries took effect on Wednesday, including massive 104 percent duties on Chinese goods, deepening his global trade war even as he prepared for negotiations with some nations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's punishing tariffs have shaken a global trading order that has persisted for decades, raised fears of recession and driven worldwide stocks sharply downward.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 has shed nearly US$6 trillion in value since Trump unveiled the tariffs a week ago, the deepest four-day loss since the benchmark's creation in the 1950s.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index is now nearing a bear market, defined as 20 percent below its most recent high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has made clear that country-specific tariffs of up to 50 percent would take effect at 0401 GMT as planned. Those tariffs will be especially steep for China, as Trump has ratcheted up duties on its imports to 104 percent in response to counter-tariffs Beijing announced last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to fight to the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing on Tuesday that President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal with the United States concerning additional tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese want to make a deal. They just don't know how to do it," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He believes China has to make a deal with the United States." If China reaches out, she added, Trump would be "incredibly gracious, but he's going to do what's best for the American people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country's 25 percent tariff on some vehicles - a countermeasure to match Trump's approach - would take effect immediately after midnight local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump caused this trade crisis - and Canada is responding with purpose and with force," Carney said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada and Mexico were exempt from the new round of tariffs Trump announced last week, but previous levies remained in place. Most goods that comply with the existing trade agreement between the three countries are not subject to those tariffs. (Reuters)

    Trump signs order to 'turbocharge' coal mining in US

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed executive orders to "turbocharge coal mining" in the country, seeking to "more than double" electricity production to keep up with power-hungry artificial intelligence technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  The executive orders, which Trump signed surrounded by miners in hard hats, will lift regulatory barriers to coal extraction and suspend the planned closures of numerous coal-fired power plants across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will end the government bias against coal," said the Republican, who instructed the Department of Justice to identify and fight any state or local regulations that were "putting our coal miners out of business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said that it would be "possible to extract enormous amounts of critical minerals and rare earths, which, you know, we need for technology and high technology in the process of coal mining."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lena Moffitt, director of the climate NGO Evergreen, criticised the president in a statement for using artificial intelligence as "a cover to bail out his fossil fuel donors with the dirtiest, most expensive power source on the grid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Production of coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, has fallen sharply in the United States over the last 15 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, coal accounted for just over 16 percent of total electricity production, outstripped by renewable energies at just over 21 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long been a sceptic of climate change, and since his return to the White House has set about boosting fossil fuels through deregulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, his administration announced a wave of environmental rollbacks targeting the green policies of his predecessor Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the most significant of them was revisiting a 2024 rule that requires coal-fired plants to eliminate nearly all their carbon emissions or commit to shutting down altogether, a cornerstone of Biden's climate agenda. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers raced to find survivors on Tuesday among the rubble of a Dominican Republic nightclub where at least 98 people, including a Major League Baseball star, were killed when the roof collapsed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Renowned Dominican merengue singer Rubby Perez, who was on stage at the popular Jet Set nightclub when the roof caved in shortly after midnight, was one of those caught up in the calamity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers said the 69-year-old was among dozens of people trapped in the rubble, some of whom were heard crying for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Dominican media outlets later reported that Perez had been found dead but Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Emergency Operations Centre, said forensics experts had "not confirmed that they found the body."
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 370 rescue personnel combed mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets for survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the dead was 51-year-old retired MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel, who won a World Series in 2011 with the St Louis Cardinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was rescued alive but died of his injuries while being taken to hospital, local media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media said there were between 500 and 1,000 people in the club when disaster struck shortly at 12:44 am local time. The club has capacity for 700 people seated and about 1,000 people standing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of ambulances ferried the injured to hospital, as scores of people gathered outside the venue desperately seeking news of their loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez was on stage when there was a blackout and the roof came crashing down, according to eyewitness reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also among the dead was the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, according to President Luis Abinader.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll started at 15 and kept rising throughout the day. By evening it had reached 66.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Abinader visited the scene and declared three days of national mourning. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday that Gaza had become "a killing field," blaming Israel for blocking aid and failing in its "unequivocal obligations" to meet the needs of the Palestinian territory's residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  "More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. No commercial supplies. As aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have reopened," Guterres said in remarks to journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pointing to the Geneva Conventions governing the treatment of people in war, he emphasised the obligation of the "occupying power" to ensure the provision of food and medical supplies to the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "None of that is happening today. No humanitarian supplies can enter Gaza," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Israeli authorities newly proposed 'authorisation mechanisms' for aid delivery risk further controlling and callously limiting aid down to the last calorie and grain of flour," Guterres told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referencing recent Israeli proposals over controlling aid into Gaza, which a UN source said included monitoring calories to prevent misuse by Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let me be clear – we will not participate in any arrangement that does not fully respect the humanitarian principles – humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality," he said, demanding guarantees for the unhindered entry of aid to the coastal territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guterres also raised the alarm about the situation in the West Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The current path is a dead end – totally intolerable in the eyes of international law and history," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the risk of the occupied West Bank transforming into another Gaza makes it even worse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is time to end the dehumanisation, protect civilians, release the hostages, ensure lifesaving aid, and renew the ceasefire." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk on Tuesday described Peter Navarro, a senior White House trade adviser, as "truly a moron" in a growing rift over Donald Trump's tariff policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk, a key aide to the president, has signalled his opposition to the tariffs, and the Tesla CEO hit out after Navarro described his electric vehicle company as "not a car manufacturer" but "a car assembler."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's new tariffs on imports have roiled markets as fears of a global recession rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk posted his criticism on X under a clip of Navarro saying Tesla imported batteries, electronics and tyres, and that Musk "wants the cheap foreign parts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk fired back, saying that "Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man recently backed a free-trade zone between North America and Europe – a wish at odds with Trump's flagship tariffs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers were on Tuesday racing to find survivers among the rubble of a Dominican Republic night club where at least 18 people died and dozens were hurt in an early-morning roof collapse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 400 rescue personnel were at the Jet Set nightclub in the Caribbean nation's capital Santo Domingo, authorities said, with dozens of ambulances on standby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media said there were between 500 and 1,000 people in the club when the roof came down following a sudden blackout during a performance by renowned merengue singer Rubby Perez, who was also trapped in the rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the dead was the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, who died of her injuries in hospital, according to President Luis Abinader.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have 18 dead; we continue working with the various institutions that are part of the national emergency center," Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Emergency Operations Center (COE), told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mendez said rescuers could hear people in the rubble crying out for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there have been 121 trips to hospital with between "two and three" injured people per ambulance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as there is hope for life, all authorities will be working to recover or rescue these people," Mendez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez's daughter Zulinka said the singer, 69, was still at the scene of the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know if they have him in an ambulance because they're not letting me through."
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media published images of a construction crane at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are rescuing all the people we can save alive and recovering those bodies we find along the way. But we have focused on people we can rescue alive because we hear them asking for help," Mendez said of the ongoing operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abinader said on X the government has "been following the case minute by minute since it happened," before rushing to the scene himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main objective is to save lives... We are deeply affected," he said on his arrival. (AFP)

    Singapore PM says tariffs 'not act of a friend'

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Singapore are "not actions one does to a friend", the city-state's leader said on Tuesday, adding the government will likely downgrade this year's economic growth forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Lawrence Wong warned that the "likelihood of a full-blown global trade war is growing" and urged his trade-reliant nation to prepare for difficult times ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very disappointed by the US move, especially considering the deep and long-standing friendship between our two countries," he said in an address to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are not actions one does to a friend."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore was hit with a 10 percent tariff despite a free-trade agreement with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rate is much less than those imposed on other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said the trade-dependent nation will be particularly hurt by a slump in the world economy and the unravelling of the global trading system based on free trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Singapore may or may not go into recession this year, but I have no doubt that our growth will be significantly impacted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trade ministry is reassessing its economic growth forecast this year of 1 to 3 percent "and will likely revise it downwards," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said that under the US-Singapore FTA, the city-state imposes zero tariffs on American goods. Singapore also runs a trade deficit with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the tariffs were truly reciprocal and if they were meant to target only those with trade surpluses, then the tariff for Singapore should be zero," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore hosts thousands of US companies and many of them have made the city their Asia-Pacific headquarters.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the island-nation is not a US defence treaty ally, it enjoys robust military ties with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This marks a profound turning point," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are entering a new phase in global affairs, one that is more arbitrary, protectionist and dangerous." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday condemned US Vice President JD Vance as "ignorant and impolite", after he referred to Washington borrowing money from "Chinese peasants".
 <br>
  <br>
  "China's position on China-US economic and trade relations has been made very clear," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is surprising and sad to hear such ignorant and impolite words from this vice president," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has upended the world economy with sweeping tariffs that have raised the spectre of an international recession but ruled out any pause in his aggressive trade policy despite a dramatic market sell-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, Vance defended those tariffs as an antidote to a "globalist economy" that he said had not worked for ordinary Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture," the vice president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is not a recipe for economic prosperity. It's not a recipe for low prices, and it's not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump believes the tariffs will revive America's lost manufacturing base by forcing foreign companies to relocate to the United States, rather than making goods abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But most economists question that and say his tariffs are arbitrary. (AFP)

    Kennedy gets teeth into ending US fluoridation

<img alt="Robert F Kennedy says a task force of health experts will study the issue of fluoride in water and make new recommendations. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799385_1_20250408113219.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy said on Monday he’s assembling a task force of health experts to study the issue and make new recommendations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Monday, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing “new scientific information" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water. The EPA sets the maximum level allowed in public water systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy was speaking after a news conference with EPA administrator Lee Zeldin in Salt Lake City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy cannot order communities to stop fluoridation, but he can direct the CDC to stop recommending it and work with the EPA to change the allowed amount.
  <br>
  <br>
  Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican governor Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their drinking water. Water systems across the state must stop fluoridation by May 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opponents say the law will hurt residents who can’t afford regular dentist visits and may rely on public drinking water containing fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy oversees the CDC, whose recommendations are widely followed but not mandatory.
  <br>
  <br>
  State and local governments decide whether to add fluoride to water and, if so, how much – as long as it doesn’t exceed a maximum set by the EPA, which is currently four milligrams per liter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 they set guidelines for how much should be added to water.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” and said it has been associated with arthritis, bone breaks and thyroid disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn. (AP)

<img alt="The Copernicus Climate Change Service said Europe saw the hottest March ever recorded.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global temperatures hovered at historic highs in March, Europe's climate monitor said on Tuesday, prolonging an extraordinary heat streak that has tested scientific expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, it was the hottest March ever recorded by a significant margin, said the Copernicus Climate Change Service, driving rainfall extremes across a continent warming faster than any other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world, meanwhile, saw the second-hottest March in the Copernicus dataset, sustaining a near-unbroken spell of record or near-record-breaking temperatures that has persisted since July 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, virtually every month has been at least 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than it was before the industrial revolution when humanity began burning massive amounts of coal, oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  March was 1.6C above pre-industrial times, prolonging an anomaly so extreme that scientists are still trying to fully explain it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That we're still at 1.6C above pre-industrial is indeed remarkable," said Friederike Otto of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists warn that every fraction of a degree of global warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate change is not just about rising temperatures but the knock-on effect of all that extra heat being trapped in the atmosphere and seas by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warmer seas mean higher evaporation and greater moisture in the atmosphere, causing heavier deluges and feeding energy into cyclones, but also affecting global rainfall patterns.
  <br>
  <br>
  March in Europe was 0.26C above the previous hottest record for the month set in 2014, Copernicus said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also "a month with contrasting rainfall extremes" across the continent, said Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs the Copernicus climate monitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some parts of Europe experienced their "driest March on record and others their wettest" for about half a century, Burgess said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere in March, scientists said that climate change intensified an extreme heatwave across Central Asia and fuelled conditions for extreme rainfall which killed 16 people in Argentina.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spectacular surge in global heat pushed 2023 and then 2024 to become the hottest years on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year was also the first full calendar year to exceed 1.5C: the safer warming limit agreed by most nations under the Paris climate accord.
  <br>
  <br>
  This represented a temporary, not permanent breach, of this longer-term target, but scientists have warned that the goal of keeping temperatures below that threshold is slipping further out of reach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists had expected that the extraordinary heat spell would subside after a warming El Nino event peaked in early 2024, and conditions gradually shifted to a cooling La Nina phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  But global temperatures have remained stubbornly high, sparking debate among scientists about what other factors could be driving warming to the top end of expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say the current period is likely the warmest the Earth has been for the last 125,000 years. (AFP)

    Seoul confirms June 3 date for presidential elections

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea will hold a presidential election on June 3, the country's acting president said on Tuesday, after Seoul's former leader Yoon Suk-yeol was removed from office over a disastrous declaration of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has been effectively leaderless since December, when former president Yoon attempted to subvert civilian rule but was quickly impeached by lawmakers and suspended from office.
  <br>
  <br>
  A court last week upheld his impeachment, stripping him of the top job, and triggering fresh elections, which must be held within 60 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had held "discussions with the National Election Commission and other related agencies", Acting President and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also took into account "the need to ensure smooth election operations and allow sufficient time for political parties to prepare," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result they have decided "to set June 3 as the date for South Korea's 21st presidential election," he said, adding that the day would be designated as a temporary public holiday to facilitate voting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han called upon ministries and the National Election Commission to "make thorough preparations to ensure an election that is fairer and more transparent than ever, and one that can earn the trust of the people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike a regular poll, where a president-elect has a two-month transition period, the winner of the June 3 election will be inaugurated the following day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han resumed acting as president recently after the Constitutional Court threw out his own impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Presidential elections are typically held on Wednesdays, but no specific weekday is required for snap polls triggered by a vacancy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official campaign period will run from May 12 until June 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is the frontrunner in any polls, with a 34 percent support rating according to the latest Gallup poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  His party already controls the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election but staged a political comeback as leader of the main opposition, despite a career shadowed by legal troubles, including ongoing trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  In distant second place is Labour Minister Kim Moon-soo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polling around nine percent, he leads a pack of challengers from Yoon's People Power Party, which also includes former party chief Han Dong-hoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also faces a separate criminal trial on charges of insurrection over the martial law bid. (AFP)

 The United States has ended emergency food aid for 14 countries, endangering the lives of millions of hungry or starving people, a United Nations agency said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World Food Program (WFP), which was already grappling with a 40 percent drop in funding for this year, said  on Monday it had been advised of the new American aid halt to 14 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  In comments on X, the agency did not name these countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If implemented, this could amount to a death sentence for millions of people facing extreme hunger and starvation," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WFP is not the only UN body hit by US funding cuts, as the United States under President Donald Trump turns sharply inward and stops trying to help other countries around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration told the UN Population Fund, an agency dedicated to promoting sexual and reproductive health, that it was ending two programs, the organisation told AFP on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of programs was for Afghanistan, while the other involved Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other countries besides the United States have also announced funding cuts in recent months, causing alarm among NGOs and international organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has largely gutted USAID, the main US humanitarian assistance organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  It previously had a yearly budget of US$42.8 billion, which was 42 percent of all aid money disbursed around the world. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tokyo's Nikkei index jumped nearly six percent in early trade on Tuesday after plunging 7.8 percent the previous day, as US tariffs fuel market volatility.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 5.81 percent, or 1,809 points, to 32,946, while the broader Topix index gained 6.2 percent, or 141 points, to 2,430.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's Kospi index was also up nearly two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump upended the world economy last week with sweeping tariffs that have raised fears of an international recession and triggered criticism even from within his own Republican Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, stock markets and oil prices collapsed further, as trading floors across the world endured waves of selling after last week's sharp losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump doubled down on his crusade on Monday, saying he was "not looking" at any pause in tariff implementation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But meanwhile "Nvidia's stabilisation and the 2.7 percent rise in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) are expected to trigger buybacks in Japan's high-priced, semiconductor-heavy stocks", brokerage house Monex said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the yen's continued weakness providing additional tailwinds, domestic markets are projected to open higher today," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One US dollar bought 147.56 yen in morning trade, compared to 147.83 yen overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both the US administration and President Trump himself are denying reports about the suspension of reciprocal tariffs, meaning concerns over tariffs still persist," Monex said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, meanwhile, said late on Monday that he had a call with Donald Trump in which they agreed to more talks on the US president's latest tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the agreement, "tariff-related volatility will likely continue", Monex added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A volcano in the central Philippines erupted early on Tuesday morning, sending a plume of ash 4,000 metres into the sky and prompting calls for local school cancellations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kanlaon Volcano, one of 24 active volcanoes in the Southeast Asian nation, erupted in December, prompting the evacuation of surrounding villages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area around the volcano on the island of Negros was still under evacuation orders when Tuesday's eruption occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An explosive eruption is currently occurring at the summit vent of Kanlaon Volcano that began at 5:51 am today," the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcano "is producing a voluminous bent plume approximately 4,000 metres tall that is drifting southwest", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted on social media showed a wide, billowing plume of smoke slowly stretching into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  The level three alert - out of a scale of five - put in place during December's eruption remained unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, hundreds of nearby residents were evacuated after the volcano spurted thousands of tonnes of harmful gases in a single day. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said the United States was starting direct, high-level talks with Iran over its nuclear programme on Saturday, in an announcement during a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said he was hopeful of reaching a deal with Tehran, but warned that the Islamic republic would be in "great danger" if the talks failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours later Tehran confirmed discussions were set for Saturday in Oman, but stressed they were "indirect" talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Iran and the United States will meet in Oman on Saturday for indirect high-level talks," Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is as much an opportunity as it is a test," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ball is in America's court."
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu meanwhile said the United States and Israel were working on another deal to free hostages from war-torn Gaza, where a ceasefire between Israel and Iran's ally Hamas has collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're dealing with the Iranians, we have a very big meeting on Saturday and we're dealing with them directly," Trump told reporters after a meeting that was meant to focus on Israel's bid to avoid US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump did not say where the talks would take place, but insisted they would not involve surrogates and would be at "almost the highest level."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's stunning announcement came a day after Iran dismissed direct negotiations on a new deal to curb the country's nuclear programme, calling the idea pointless.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president pulled out of the last deal in 2018, during his first presidency, and there has been widespread speculation that Israel, possibly with US help, might attack Iranian facilities if no new agreement is reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump issued a stern warning to Tehran, however.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think if the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran's going to be in great danger, and I hate to say it, great danger, because they can't have a nuclear weapon," he said. (AFP)

    Supreme Court backs Trump over Alien Enemies Act

<img alt="US President Donald Trump has used the law to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799334_1_20250408075344.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court handed Donald Trump a victory on Monday by letting him use a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members as part of the Republican president's hardline approach to immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  The court granted the administration's request to lift Washington-based US Judge James Boasberg's March 15 order that had temporarily blocked the summary deportations under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act while litigation in the case continues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act on March 15 to swiftly deport the alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, attempting to speed up removals with a law best known for its use to intern Japanese, Italian and German immigrants during World War Two.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a legal challenge handled by the American Civil Liberties Union, a group of Venezuelan men in the custody of US immigration authorities on the same day sued on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, seeking to block the deportations. They argued, among other things, that Trump's order exceeded his powers because the Alien Enemies Act authorises removals only when war has been declared or the United States has been invaded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Alien Enemies Act authorises the president to deport, detain or place restrictions on individuals whose primary allegiance is to a foreign power and who might pose a national security risk in wartime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boasberg, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, temporarily blocked the deportations. But Trump's administration allowed two planes already in the air to continue to El Salvador where American officials handed 238 Venezuelan men over to Salvadoran authorities to be placed in the Central American country's "Terrorism Confinement Center."
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge also has scrutinized whether the Trump administration violated his order by failing to return the deportation flights after his order was issued. Justice Department lawyers said the flights had left US airspace by the time Boasberg issued a written order and thus were not required to return. They dismissed the weight of Boasberg's spoken order during a hearing two hours earlier calling for any planes carrying deportees to be turned around.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's administration has argued that Boasberg's temporary ban encroached on presidential authority to make national security decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On March 18, Trump called for Boasberg's impeachment by Congress - a process that could remove him from the bench - drawing a rebuke from the US Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump on social media called Boasberg, who was confirmed by the US Senate in 2011 in a bipartisan 96-0 vote, a "Radical Left Lunatic" and a "troublemaker and agitator."
  <br>
  <br>
  The DC Circuit upheld Boasberg's order after holding a contentious hearing that involved heated language. Judge Patricia Millett told Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign that "Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here." Ensign responded, "We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Family members of many of the deported Venezuelan migrants deny the alleged gang ties. Lawyers for one of the deportees, a Venezuelan professional soccer player and youth coach, said US officials had wrongly labelled him a gang member based on a tattoo of a crown meant to honour his favourite team, Real Madrid.

    Trump threatens further 50pc tariffs on China

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened huge additional tariffs on imports from China, raising the possibility of further escalation in a trade war that has already wiped trillions of dollars from global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  "If China does not withdraw its 34 percent increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50 percent, effective April 9th," Trump said in a Truth Social post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Trump put an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods, on top of two rounds of 10 percent tariffs already declared in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is not immediately clear how Trump's new threat factors into this calculation.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's response included export controls on rare earth elements, and Beijing plans for its own 34 percent tariff on US goods, stacking atop existing Chinese levies set to begin April 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said the new tariffs harmed the stability of global production and supply chains and seriously impacted the world’s economic recovery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Pressure and threats are not the way to deal with China. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” Lin told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took aim at Beijing's economic practices on social media Monday, criticising its "non-monetary tariffs" and "illegal subsidization of companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated."
  <br>
  <br>
  But "negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. (Agencies)
