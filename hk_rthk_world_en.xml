<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's ousted premier said on Thursday that he had opposed suspended President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law, testifying for the first time at his former boss' impeachment trial about the events of a night that threw the country into turmoil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han Duck-soo was impeached by parliament as acting President and Prime Minister in December over alleged obstruction of the trial that would formally remove Yoon from office for his martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, he appeared before that trial for the first time, telling Seoul's Constitutional Court he had "expressed my opposition" to Yoon's decision to suspend civilian rule on the night of December 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said he and most of his fellow cabinet members "believed such a declaration would put South Korea in serious difficulty", and that he recalled them "being concerned and trying to dissuade it".
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's hearing was Yoon's 10th before Seoul's Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the hearings wrap up, the judges will go behind closed doors to deliberate Yoon's fate — with elections required in 60 days if he is removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon walked out of the court just five minutes after proceedings began on Thursday, according to a pool report.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyer Yoon Kap-keun told reporters that the ousted president felt it was "inappropriate" for him to sit in the same court room with Han "or for the president to watch the prime minister testify".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not good for the nation's prestige," his lawyer quoted Yoon as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon later returned to hear the testimony of former senior intelligence official Hong Jang-won, seen as a key figure in the decision to declare martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong has claimed to be in possession of a memo containing a list of names of individuals Yoon ordered arrested during the night of the martial law declaration, including the leaders of the opposition and Yoon's own ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will do my best to recount everything as I remember it," Hong told reporters before the hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of South Korea's National Police Agency, who is also on trial on insurrection charges related to the martial law decree, is another witness. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Thursday released the bodies of four Israeli hostages, said to include a mother and her two children who had long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation's agony following the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel which triggered the Gaza war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remains were said to be of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kfir, who was 9 months old when he was taken, was the youngest captive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The militants displayed four black coffins on a stage in the Gaza Strip surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a vampire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fighters then carried the coffins over to Red Cross vehicles, where staffers in red vests covered them in white sheets before placing them inside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Cross convoy headed back to Israel, where authorities will carry out the formal identification of the remains using DNA, expected to take up to two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only then will the families be given the final notification. The Israeli military confirmed it had received the coffins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people, including large numbers of masked and armed fighters from Hamas and other factions, gathered at the handover site on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expects President Xi Jinping to visit the United States, without giving a timeline for his trip.
 <br>
  <br>
  In remarks made to reporters on Air Force One, Trump also said "it's possible" for the two countries to have a new trade deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2020, the US had already agreed to "a great trade deal with China" and a new deal is possible, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A conversation or interaction between Xi and Trump is seen as crucial to a potential easing or delay of trade tariffs after the US imposed a 10 percent tariff on goods from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi last travelled to the US in November 2023, in his fifth visit to the country as president for a summit with then US president Joe Biden, resulting in agreements to resume military-to-military communications and curb fentanyl production.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll have, ultimately, President Xi, we will have everybody coming," Trump said while also speaking about others leaders visiting the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he was talking to China about TikTok as the US seeks to broker a sale of the popular app owned by Chinese parent firm ByteDance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders had spoken just before Trump took office on January 20 and discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan. Trump said last week he had spoken to Xi since taking office as well, but did not offer details on the topics of that conversation. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar on Thursday handed over the first batch of hundreds of Chinese scam centre workers who are set to be repatriated through Thailand in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of foreigners are expected to be freed and returned from scam compounds in Myanmar in the coming weeks, starting with 600 Chinese over the next three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The compounds run by criminal gangs are staffed by foreigners, many of whom say they were trafficked and forced to work running internet scams swindling people around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of those involved are Chinese and Beijing has stepped up pressure on Myanmar and Thailand to shut the centres down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Karen Border Guard Force, a militia allied with the Myanmar junta, has said it is preparing to deport 10,000 people linked to the compounds in areas it controls on the border with Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two double-decker coaches delivered a first round of returning workers to the border post in the western Thai town of Mae Sot on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First group of 50 Chinese have crossed to Thailand and headed to the airport. There will be three more batches (today), each with 50 Chinese," a local border task force official has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has put on 16 flights over the next three days to ferry 600 of its nationals home direcly from Mae Sot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The release follows several visits by Public Security Assistant Minister Liu Zhongyi to Bangkok and the border in recent weeks to arrange the repatriation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scam centres have proliferated across Southeast Asia in recent years, including in Cambodia and the Philippines, as the value of the industry has boomed to billions of US dollars a year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US airline Delta on Wednesday said it will offer US$30,000, or HK$233,395, to each passenger on a plane that crashed as it landed at Toronto airport this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This gesture has no strings attached and does not affect rights" of passengers, a company spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a Delta Air Lines plane that departed from the US city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, hit the runway hard at Toronto's main airport and flipped upside down.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fireball and thick plumes of black smoke engulfed the plane as it skidded to a halt on its roof but none of the 80 people on board were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delta said 21 passengers were injured in the accident but only one was still hospitalised as of Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paramedic services said emergency responders dealt with various injuries among the passengers, including back sprains, head injuries, anxiety and headaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic footage of the crash posted on social media on Tuesday showed the Bombardier CRJ-900 coming in to land before slamming into the runway, then sliding forward in a roll, with its wings sheared off before it stopped on its back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation, assisted by the US Federal Aviation Administration, Delta and Mitsubishi, which purchased the CRJ line of planes from Bombardier in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Toronto crash was the latest in a recent string of air incidents in North America, including a midair collision between a US Army helicopter and a passenger jet in Washington that killed 67 people, and a medical transport plane crash in Philadelphia that left seven dead. (AFP)

    Trump brands Zelensky a 'dictator' in bitter clash

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump called Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky a "dictator" on Wednesday, widening a personal rift with major implications for efforts to end the conflict triggered by Russia's military offensive three years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States has provided essential funding and arms to Ukraine, but Trump made an abrupt policy shift by opening talks with Moscow just weeks after he returned to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to have a country left," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was elected in 2019 for a five-year term and has remained leader under martial law imposed as his country fights for its survival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump savaged Zelensky, saying "he refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing (Joe) Biden 'like a fiddle.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's popularity has fallen, but the percentage of Ukrainians who trust him has never dipped below 50 percent since the conflict started, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Biden, the United States had lauded Zelensky as a hero and hammered Moscow with sanctions as Ukraine battled against advancing Russian soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump held a press conference on Tuesday in which he tore into the Ukrainian leader and repeated Kremlin narratives such as the claim that Ukraine started the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's invective drew shock from Europe where German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was "wrong and dangerous" to call Zelensky a dictator.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington, Trump's former vice president Mike Pence also issued a stinging rebuke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives," Pence wrote on X. (AFP)

    'Constructive' talks after China blasts tariffs at WTO

<img alt="The US, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the WTO discussions. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792389_2_20250220104914.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Wednesday that discussions on trade tensions were "constructive", after China accused the US of imposing "tariff shocks" that could upend the global trading system.
 <br>
  <br>
  China condemned tariffs launched or threatened by US President Donald Trump at a World Trade Organization meeting on Tuesday. Washington dismissed China's comments as hypocritical.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has announced sweeping 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory tariffs and to file a WTO dispute against Washington in what could be an early test of Trump's stance towards the institution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the six countries that participated in the talks on trade turbulence, put on the agenda by China, raised concern about mounting tensions, but also called for restraint, said WTO spokesperson Ismaila Dieng in a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the discussions, which were part of broader talks on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The large majority "stressed the importance of upholding WTO principles and values and called for action to preserve the stability and effectiveness of the global trading system", Dieng added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time that mounting trade frictions have been formally addressed on the agenda of the watchdog's top decision-making body, the General Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao expressed strong dissatisfaction with US tariffs on Chinese goods in a letter addressed to the newly confirmed US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the US to unilaterally impose tariffs undermined normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US", Wang said in the letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said Beijing was willing to work with Washington to "strengthen dialogue, manage differences, promote cooperation" and hoped to create a "fair and predictable policy environment" for the two countries' business communities to cooperate. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Residents in a central Manila neighbourhood lined up on Wednesday, as dengue cases spike nationwide, to collect a bounty – one peso for every five mosquitoes, dead or alive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carlito Cernal, village captain in Addition Hills, said the awareness-raising project he initiated could have a "huge impact" on curbing the tropical disease's spread when combined with local clean-up efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine health officials and experts were less convinced, but enthusiasm was high among residents who carried pails, cups and other containers filled with dengue-spreading mosquitoes to exchange for cash at the village hall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iluminado Candasua brought three live specimens in a sealed plastic cup that were duly counted and transferred by village officials to their so-called death chamber, a glass-enclosed UV light machine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very hard to capture mosquitoes," Candasua said, explaining how he strategically chose a darkly lit fire station where he used a cup to manually trap the insects against a wall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Candasua said the peso he got for his efforts, worth little more than a US penny, would go into a piggy bank he's using to save for a cellphone for his child.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization ranked the Philippines as the country most affected by dengue in the Western Pacific region in 2023 when it had 167,355 cases and 575 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tropical disease, while rarely fatal, carries symptoms ranging from fever and headaches to swollen glands.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country has seen an "unusual rise" in cases this year, with 28,200 patients recorded as of February 1, according to Department of Health spokesman Dr Albert Domingo, a 40 percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five cities and municipalities have declared outbreaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Domingo said on Wednesday it was important that local communities consult with health authorities before launching ad hoc efforts, adding that the problem was best addressed by "going back to the fundamentals".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sooner we clean our surroundings and overturn any possible areas where stagnant water is collecting, then we will have a better fight against dengue," he said, urging residents to protect themselves with insect repellent and long sleeves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Public health expert Anthony Leachon said that while he welcomed all anti-dengue initiatives, the Addition Hills roundup would have "little or no impact at all".
  <br>
  <br>
  Some residents, he warned, might even exacerbate the problem by cultivating mosquitoes for coins.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Rachel Estoque did not intentionally breed mosquitoes, the haul she turned in on Wednesday came from a source of stagnant water in her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 45-year-old housewife said she woke up early to catch mosquito larvae growing in water in her flower pot. The 20 larvae earned her four pesos, enough for a tiny packet of cooking oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  But like others waiting to trade in their catch, Estoque said the money was less important than the principle involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My child suffered from dengue before and I know how scary and difficult that is... that's why I'm participating in this project," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis's heart is holding up very well despite his pneumonia, a Vatican source said on Wednesday, amid growing concerns over the hospitalised 88-year-old's condition.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff was admitted to a Rome hospital with bronchitis last week after suffering breathing difficulties, but the Holy See revealed on Tuesday evening that he had developed pneumonia in both of his lungs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope spent a peaceful night, woke up and had breakfast," the Vatican said on Wednesday after Francis's fifth night at the Gemelli hospital, which has a suite reserved especially for popes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope is breathing on his own. His heart is holding up very well," a source in the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis has been speaking to friends by telephone, has been out of bed and sitting in a chair, and working on and off, the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, the Vatican had reported that Francis was in "good spirits."
  <br>
  <br>
  But in an evening medical bulletin, it warned that "the laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the Holy Father's clinical condition continue to present a complex picture."
  <br>
  <br>
  A "polymicrobial infection" which has come on top of "bronchiectasis and asthmatic bronchitis, and which required the use of cortisone antibiotic therapy, makes therapeutic treatment more complex," the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The follow-up chest CT scan which the Holy Father underwent this afternoon... demonstrated the onset of bilateral pneumonia, which required additional drug therapy," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff had part of his right lung cut away when he was 21, after developing pleurisy that almost killed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican has cancelled a papal audience on Saturday and said the pope would not attend mass on Sunday, although it has yet to announce plans for his weekly Angelus prayer, which is held on Sunday at midday. (AFP)

    Trump says auto tariffs to be around 25pc

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump expanded his offensive against trading partners on Tuesday, threatening 25 percent tariffs on imported cars, and similar or higher duties on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has announced a broad range of levies on some of the biggest US trading partners since taking office in January, arguing that they will help tackle unfair practices – and in some cases using the threats to influence policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He recently pledged 10 percent duties on all goods coming from China, and 25 on steel and aluminium imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  At his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, he told reporters that tariffs on the automobile industry will "be in the neighbourhood of 25 percent," with specifics to come around April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about threatened tariffs on pharmaceuticals and chips, Trump said: "It'll be 25 percent and higher, and it'll go very substantially higher over (the) course of a year."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he wanted to give affected companies time to bring their operations to the United States, saying that he had been contacted by major firms that "want to come back."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also said that Washington's trading partners could avoid being taxed by investing in factories in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to give them time to come in," he said. "When they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff. So we want to give them a little bit of a chance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have warned it is often Americans who end up paying the cost of tariffs on imports, rather than foreign exporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of the cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's special envoy was in Kyiv on Wednesday, saying he was there to "listen" to Kyiv's concerns, a day after the US president tore into his Ukrainian counterpart in a surprise press conference.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on Tuesday, after Russian and US officials met in Saudi Arabia for their first high-level talks in over three years without Ukraine taking part, Trump appeared to blame Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for having "started" the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today I heard, 'oh, well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal," Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky had chided the US-Russia talks for not including Kyiv, saying efforts to end the war must be "fair and involve European countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv by train on Wednesday morning on what he said was a mission to "sit and listen" to Kyiv's concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand the need for security guarantees... Part of my mission is to sit and listen and say: what are your concerns?" Kellogg said in a video posted by Ukraine's Suspilne news outlet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia and the United States agreed on Tuesday to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv and its European allies have become alarmed at being cut out of the process with Russia to end the conflict. (AFP)

    Rapper A$AP Rocky found not guilty in assault trial

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Musician A$AP Rocky was found not guilty of two counts of felony assault at the conclusion of a trial in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The musician, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, has two children with the singer Rihanna. He would've faced more than two decades in prison if he had been convicted of the alleged attack on a former friend in Hollywood in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the weeks-long trial, prosecutors said Mayers had shot a nine-millimetre semi-automatic weapon during a confrontation with Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli, on November 6, 2021, in the heart of Hollywood, grazing Ephron's hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mayers, 36, had insisted he had been carrying only a harmless prop gun.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles courtroom, full of fans of the hip-hop performer and his singing superstar partner, exploded into screaming glee as Rocky and Rihanna embraced and sobbed at the not guilty verdict from jurors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank y’all for saving my life," he told the jurors as they left the Los Angeles courtroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rihanna cried and hugged the defence lawyers, as did Rocky.
  <br>
  <br>
  She attended the trial sporadically and brought the couple’s two sons – two-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and one-year-old Riot Rose Mayers – for some of the closing arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The verdict came at the height of Rocky’s fame, if not the pinnacle of his music career.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-time Grammy nominee, fashion mogul and actor has a banner year in the works, and can now look to it without the threat of prison hanging over him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is scheduled to headline the Rolling Loud music festival in March; he is one of the celebrity co-chairs of fashion’s biggest night, the Met Gala, in May; and he stars with Denzel Washington in director Spike Lee’s film “Highest 2 Lowest,” set for release in early summer. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia and the United States agreed on Tuesday to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war in Ukraine after talks that drew a strong rebuke from Kyiv over its exclusion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington noted European nations would have to have a seat at the negotiating table "at some point", following the first high-level official Washington-Moscow talks since the 2022 war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some European leaders, alarmed by President Donald Trump's overhaul of US policy on Russia, fear Washington will make serious concessions to Moscow and re-write the continent's security arrangement in a Cold War-style deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed his nation's exclusion from the Riyadh gathering, which lasted for more than four hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that any talks aimed at ending the war should be "fair" and involve European countries, including Turkey - which offered to host negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will only be feeding Putin's appetite," a Ukrainian senior official requesting anonymity said, referring to the launch of talks without Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov agreed to "appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible", the State Department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington added the sides had also agreed to "establish a consultation mechanism" to address "irritants" to Russia and America's relationship, noting the sides would lay the groundwork for future cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuri Ushakov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide, confirmed the negotiating teams' appointment but said it was "difficult" to discuss a date for a potential Trump-Putin meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump brushed aside Ukraine's concern about being left out of the meeting and suggested he could meet President Putin shortly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was now more confident of a deal to end the Ukraine war after the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting marks a major diplomatic coup for Moscow, which had been isolated for three years under the previous US administration of president Joe Biden. (AFP)

<img alt='According to a court filing on Monday by the director of the Office of Administration, Musk "is an employee of the White House." Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792176_1_20250218223453.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk is not an official employee of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and has "no formal authority to make government decisions," according to a White House court filing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man is widely seen as the de-facto head of Doge, created by President Donald Trump, which has sought to drastically reduce US government spending including with thousands of job cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had announced in November that "the Great Elon Musk... will lead the Department of Government Efficiency ('DOGE')."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the filing on Monday by Joshua Fisher, director of the Office of Administration, Musk "is an employee of the White House... as a non-career Special Government Employee" and a "Senior Advisor to the President."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like other senior White House advisors, Mr Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself. Mr Musk can only advise the President and communicate the President's directives," Fisher said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US Doge Service is a component of the Executive Office of the President. The US Doge Service Temporary Organisation is within the US Doge Service. Both are separate from the White House Office," he said in the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Musk is an employee of the White House Office. He is not an employee of the US Doge Service or US Doge Service Temporary Organisation. Mr Musk is not the Temporary Administrator," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fisher's filing was made in a case brought against Musk by 14 US states, including New Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint interview with Musk due to be broadcast on Fox News later on Tuesday, Trump took aim at critics saying that the Tesla founder was the one running the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think nobody in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me... But you know what I have learned Elon? That people are smart, they get it," Trump said in an excerpt of the interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk added: "Yeah they do actually." (AFP)

 An extraordinary Arab League meeting on Gaza, initially set for next week, has been postponed to March 4, host Egypt said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian foreign ministry said the new date was agreed with Arab League members as part of "substantive and logistical preparations" for the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting was called in response to US President Donald Trump's proposal to take over the war-battered Gaza Strip and move its Palestinian inhabitants elsewhere, including to Egypt and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia is set to host the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Friday to present their own plan for Gaza's reconstruction while ensuring that Palestinians remain on their land.

 China hopes that all parties and stakeholders can participate in the peace talks to solve the Ukraine crisis, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Beijing welcomes all peace efforts over Ukraine, including the talks between the United States and Russia, ahead of a meeting between diplomats from the two countries in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump is pushing for a swift resolution to the three-year conflict in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv was not invited to the discussions in Riyadh, while European leaders were gathering in Paris for emergency talks on how to respond to the radical pivot by the new US administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo said: "We hope that all parties can work together to resolve the root causes of the Ukraine crisis, find a balanced, effective and sustainable security structure and achieve long-term peace and stability in Europe." (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior officials from Russia and the US met in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to begin talks on improving ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegations led by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met at the Diriyah Palace in Riyadh.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting marks another pivotal step by the Trump administration to reverse Washington's policy on isolating Russia and is meant to pave the way for a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier this month upended US policy toward Ukraine and Russia by saying he and Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian officials aren’t taking part in the meeting, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday his country wouldn't accept the outcome if Kyiv didn't take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio was accompanied by US national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, while Lavrov sat next to the Kremlin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan and national security adviser Musaed al Alban joined Rubio, Lavrov and others for the start of the meeting but were expected to leave early in the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ushakov said on Monday the talks would be “purely bilateral” and would not include Ukrainian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks mark a significant expansion of US-Russian contacts nearly three years into a war that has seen ties fall to the lowest level in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lavrov and then-US Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked briefly on the sidelines of a G-20 meeting in India nearly two years ago, and in the fall of 2022, US and Russian spymasters met in Turkey amid Washington’s concerns that Moscow could resort to nuclear weapons amid battlefield setbacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recent US diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that will not be favourable to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the UK on Monday to decide how to respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Trump and Zelensky following the meeting. (AP)

<img alt="People gather outside the US Capitol to protest Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency firing government employees. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792072_1_20250218111416.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Protesters against US President Donald Trump and his policies braved frigid temperatures in parts of  America on Monday, shouting “No kings on Presidents Day” in East Coast cities and attempting to enter the Arizona Statehouse to oppose a bill that would bolster fast-changing federal immigration enforcement.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Florida and California, local media outlets reported on hundreds of protesters carrying out “Not my Presidents Day” protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The “No Kings" theme was orchestrated by the 50501 Movement, and marked the second set of protests criss-crossing the nation in less than two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar nationwide event on February 5 drew participants in dozens of cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sets of rallies denounced Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk, the leader of Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, an outside-government organisation designed to slash federal spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 1,000 people marched in the snow from the Statehouse in Boston to City Hall, chanting “Elon Musk has got to go” and other slogans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The temperature was below freezing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston protesters, some dressed in Revolutionary War-style clothing, carried signs saying such things as “This is a Coup” and “Cowards Bow to Trump, Patriots Stand Up.” One sign had a depiction of Uncle Sam saying “I Want You to Resist.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thought it was important to be here on Presidents Day to demonstrate for what America stands for,” said Emily Manning, 55, a Boston engineer who came to the rally with her two teenage sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  “American values are not the values of the plutocracy or the limited few rich people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers of Monday’s protests, which were focused on state capitals and major cities including Washington, DC; Orlando, Florida; and Seattle, said they were targeting “anti-democratic and illegal actions of the Trump administration and its plutocratic allies.”
  <br>
  <br>
  One sign at the rally that attracted hundreds in the nation's capital said, “Deport Musk Dethrone Trump.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The rallies followed a series of Trump executive orders and came just days after layoffs across federal agencies as part of an effort to reduce the government workforce. (AP)

    Argentina's president denies role in 'cryptogate' scam

<img alt="Authorities are investigating Argentina's President Javier Milei for his promotion of a cryptocurrency which crashed within hours of its launch last week. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792070_1_20250218105528.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentine President Javier Milei on Monday denied promoting a cryptocurrency that crashed last week, losing investors billions of dollars and prompting a flood of complaints, as prosecutors reportedly prepare an investigation into the scandal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I did not promote it, I spread it," Milei told broadcaster TN, adding that it "is a problem between private parties because the State does not play a role here."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I acted in good faith," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina's federal prosecutor's office will examine whether Milei engaged in fraud or criminal association or was in breach of his duties when he praised the $LIBRA cryptocurrency on social media Friday evening, according to news reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The currency's value soared then crashed, and Milei deleted his blessing hours later, saying he had made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentine economists, crypto specialists and opposition political figures criticised the self-declared "anarcho-capitalist" president, an economist by training, and said the digital asset could be a fraud or a Ponzi scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry observers said the operation was likely a "rug pull" -- a scam where developers unveil a crypto token, attract investors, then quickly cash out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights NGO Observatory for the Right to the City, one of several complainants, alleges Milei formed part of a "criminal organisation that organised a fraud with the $LIBRA cryptocurrency that simultaneously affected more than 40,000 people with losses of more than US$4 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kobeissi Letter, a publication that provides analysis on global capital markets, said on X Friday that within minutes of its launch, "multiple large holders began liquidating MILLIONS of USD worth of $LIBRA."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This included gains of +US$4 million or more as $LIBRA rose to US$4.6 billion in market (capitalisation)," it reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Milei said he had "nothing to hide" from an investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that those who carried out the transactions, including "a lot of bots," were people who "knew very well what the risk was."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, former president and opposition figure Cristina Kirchner called Milei a "crypto-scammer" and opposition parliamentarians announced they would institute impeachment proceedings against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any such proceedings would be highly unlikely to succeed, however, as they would require a two-thirds majority in the lower house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other parties are seeking the creation of a special parliamentary commission to question Milei. (AFP)

    Plane flips upside down in Toronto crash, 18 injured

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Delta Air Lines jet with 80 people onboard crash-landed on Monday at Toronto's main airport, officials said, flipping upside down and leaving at least 18 people injured but causing no deaths.
 <br>
  <br>
  Endeavor Air Flight 4819 with 76 passengers and four crew was landing in the afternoon in Canada's largest metropolis, having flown from Minneapolis in the US state of Minnesota, the airline said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No explanation of the cause of the accident, or how the plane ended up flipped with its wings clipped, has been provided.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very early on. It's really important that we do not speculate. What we can say is the runway was dry and there were no crosswind conditions," said Todd Aitken, the airport's fire chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  He confirmed that 18 people had been injured in the accident, with no fatalities.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the wounded, including those with minor injuries, were taken to area hospitals either by ambulance or helicopter, said the paramedic services' Lawrence Saindon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic images on local broadcasts and shared on social media showed people stumbling away from the upside down CRJ-900 plane, shielding their faces from strong gusts of wind and blowing snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire crews appeared to douse the aircraft with water as smoke wafted from the fuselage and as passengers were still exiting the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's North America correspondent Simon Marks said it had been snowing at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The images in which through the snow that was enveloping the airport, you could just make out the visual of a CRJ-900 regional jet that had crash at the airport and somehow ended up…literally upside down on the runway."
  <br>
  <br>
  Toronto airport authority chief executive Deborah Flint told a news conference the incident did not involve any other planes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency crews were "heroic" in their response, she said, "reaching the site within minutes and quickly evacuating the passengers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them "have already been reunited with their friends and their families," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airport suspended all flights after the incident, before resuming them at around 5:00pm EST, more than two hours later. It said passengers should expect long delays.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Europe's security is at a turning point, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday, as she arrived in Paris for an emergency meeting to address Washington's shock policy shift on the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Europe's security is at a turning point. Yes, it is about Ukraine - but it is also about us. We need an urgency mindset. We need a surge in defence. And we need both of them now," she said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leaders from key European powers gathered in France to strategise after US President Donald Trump blindsided allies by launching efforts with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris talks come as Washington said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff would on Tuesday meet with a Russian delegation including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Riyadh ahead of a future meeting between Trump and Putin in the Saudi capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Council chief Antonio Costa, who was also participating, said the meeting was "the beginning of a process, that will continue with the involvement of all the partners committed to peace and security in Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The European Union and its Member States will play a central role in this process," he wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe is scrambling to come up with plans to ensure any peace deal in Ukraine is lasting, with Britain saying it would be willing to deploy peacekeepers if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris meeting was to bring together the heads of government of Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain, as well as the heads of the European Council, the European Commission and Nato. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese AI app DeepSeek will not be available to download in South Korea pending a review of its handling of user data, authorities in Seoul said Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek's R1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders with its ability to match the functions of its Western competitors at a fraction of the cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of countries have questioned DeepSeek's storage of user data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission said DeepSeek would no longer be available for download until a review of its personal data collection practices was carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has "acknowledged that considerations for domestic privacy laws were somewhat lacking", the data protection agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It assessed that bringing the app into line with local privacy laws "would inevitably take a significant amount of time", the agency added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To prevent further concerns from spreading, the commission recommended that DeepSeek temporarily suspend its service while making the necessary improvements," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has "accepted" that proposal, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration and experimentation that could lead to faster breakthroughs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the firm has unveiled large language models challenging the dominate tools developing by its US rivals, but at a lower cost. (AFP & agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Singapore's opposition leader was fined on Monday for lying to parliament while helping a fellow party member cover up a false witness account, but narrowly avoided being barred from contesting upcoming national elections.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pritam Singh, 48, secretary-general of the Workers' Party, was found guilty on two counts of lying to a parliamentary committee probing a fellow MP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conviction comes as the Southeast Asian nation's political opposition seeks to challenge the dominance of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) in elections expected within months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PAP has ruled Singapore since 1959.
  <br>
  <br>
  District court judge Luke Tan said that contrary to what he told the committee, Singh had not done enough to get rookie MP Raeesah Khan to admit to her lie in parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge also gave credence to Khan's testimony that Singh had told her during a meeting to "take the lie to the grave."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh told reporters outside court that based on "advice I have and that I've been given, I will be running for the general elections."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have been advised that the law is quite clear," he said, adding he understood the elections department would release a statement later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not going to be an easy election... we'll have to fight hard, and that's what we will do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh, who said he would appeal the court's decision, was fined Sg$7,000 for each charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The path of choosing opposition politics is not for the faint hearted," Singh said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the constitution, a person fined a minimum of Sg$10,000 (US$7,400) or jailed for at least one year, is disqualified from running for election or holding a parliamentary seat for five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will not be disqualified as the threshold of $10,000 fine per charge is not crossed. You can't stack up the fines," Eugene Tan, who teaches constitutional law at Singapore Management University, told reporters. (AFP)

    UK ready to send troops to Ukraine: Starmer

<img alt="British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says the UK could send troops to Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping force. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791944_1_20250217111813.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ready to send UK troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force as he tried to show the US that European nations should have a role in the talks on ending the conflict.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said he had not taken the decision to consider putting British servicemen and women "in harm's way" lightly, but securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter further aggression.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday said Ukraine and Europe would be part of any "real negotiations" to end Moscow's war, signalling that US talks with Russia this week were a chance to see how serious Putin is about peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  The end of Russia's war with Ukraine "when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again," Starmer wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer's comments were the first time he has explicitly said he is considering deploying British peacekeepers to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has previously said that Britain was willing to help play a part in any peace deal that is negotiated.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Starmer said he was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by "putting our own troops on the ground if necessary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do not say that lightly," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer is expected to join German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other European leaders in Paris on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron convened talks on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump stunned European allies in Nato and Ukraine last week when he announced he had held a call with Putin without consulting them and would start a peace process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, then suggested Ukraine and other European leaders would have no place at peace negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and Russian officials are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to start talks aimed at ending Russia's nearly three-year war in Ukraine. (Reuters)

    'Conclave' and 'Brutalist' share Bafta honours

<img alt='The cast and crew of "Conclave" pose for a picture after the movie won the Best Film award at the 2025 Bafta awards. Photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791943_1_20250217110853.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Papal thriller "Conclave" and immigrant epic "The Brutalist" on Sunday tied for top honours at Britain's Bafta awards with each film picking up four coveted gongs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Conclave", directed by German-born Edward Berger, won the Bafta for the best film with its tale of the intrigue and horse-trading behind the scenes during the election of a new pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accepting the award, Berger recalled the journey to make the film took seven years, paying tribute to British screenplay writer Peter Straughan's "wonderful script" and lead actor Ralph Fiennes.
  <br>
  <br>
  US filmmaker Brady Corbet took the Bafta for best director for "The Brutalist", while leading man Adrien Brody scooped up the best actor gong for his portrayal of a Hungarian Holocaust survivor and architect who emigrates to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brody told a winners press conference that the film was "an opportunity for me to honour my own ancestral struggles".
  <br>
  <br>
  In "a film that speaks to tremendous cruelty and despicable behaviour in our past... we see elements existing today that can guide us and remind us of that," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran British actor Fiennes, who played a cardinal in "Conclave", once again saw his hopes of winning a Bafta gong dashed, losing out to Brody in the race for the honour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scandal-hit "Emilia Perez", a surreal musical about a Mexican druglord who transitions to a woman, had been heavily favoured at the beginning of the year. But it ended the evening with just two Baftas, including one for Zoe Saldana for best supporting actress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until last month, French director Jacques Audiard's movie had been expected to be a frontrunner having won 11 nominations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But old racist and Islamophobic tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascon surfaced at the end of January, shaking up the race just before the London ceremony and the Oscars on March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  A surprise of the night was the Bafta for best actress which went to 25-year-old Mikey Madison for her portrayal of a sex worker in the black comedy "Anora" about an erotic dancer's whirlwind romance gone wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madison, who beat out frontrunner Demi Moore, told reporters she wanted to dedicate the award to "the sex worker community, I see you, you deserve respect and human dignity". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 India's capital New Delhi was jolted awake on Monday by powerful tremors from a magnitude 4.0 earthquake, with its epicentre on the edge of the sprawling megacity an hour before dawn.
 <br>
  <br>
  There were no immediate reports of major damage, but terrified residents rushed outside as buildings shook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Survey said the quake struck at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to follow "safety precautions" and stay alert to "possible aftershocks".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tremors were felt in Delhi and nearby areas. Urging everyone to stay calm and follow safety precautions, staying alert for possible aftershocks. Authorities are keeping a close watch on the situation," Modi said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police issued an emergency number to call for help, saying: "We hope you all are safe, Delhi."
  <br>
  <br>
  Northern India lies on a major geological faultline where the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence. (AFP)

<img alt="Honourees of the Outstanding Asian American Women Who Dared gala say the event comes at a crucial time, as US President Donald Trump aggressively moves to stamp out diversity, equity and inclusiveness. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791931_1_20250217101545.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A special event in the United States has been shining a spotlight on the achievements of Asian American women, in areas ranging from academics to sports.
 <br>
  <br>
  The awards gala for the Outstanding Asian American Women Who Dared – held in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley on February 13 – recognised 12 people, who said the event comes at a crucial time, especially with US President Donald Trump aggressively moving to stamp out traces of diversity, equity and inclusiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re entering a very special era in history, and it just makes us have to really step in and step up and work harder,” honouree Liu Xin – the founder of the Enlight Foundation, which focuses on education equality and helping youth engage in developing climate solutions – said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A presenter at the show, Fiona Ma, is the first Asian American Woman to be elected treasurer of California.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s been very difficult for me being an Asian woman moving up the ranks and politics. And, you know, tonight is about recognising other trailblazers and people who are really making a mark.”
  <br>
  <br>
  And one of those making a mark is Sue Xu, the managing partner of venture capital firm Amino Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has contributed to the success of at least 45 companies with a total value of more than US$100 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has also addressed the United Nations about the role of artificial intelligence in combatting human trafficking and promoting the welfare of women.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel like, woman's voice hasn’t been heard. Especially nowadays, when you're talking about DeepSeek, talking about AI. And then I feel like a lot of times woman is victims of AI. And then, you know, South Korea, they just passed that out, criminalising possession for, you know, deep-fake pornography. I feel like as a woman, if we lead with responsibility, we have a chance,” Xu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While many of the honourees stem from the world of business and technology, artists were celebrated too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honouree Chen Jiebing is one of the foremost erhu virtuosos in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai native has been nominated for a Grammy and recently had the honour of Nasa using her music to celebrate its 60th anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want the world to see and hear the unique vocal expressions of this instrument and it’s versatility to incorporate with other Western styles of music such as jazz, and even American Blue Grass country style music.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like all the honourees, Chen has daring goals. Hers is to someday elevate the erhu to be as widely recognised worldwide as the violin.

    Trump expects to meet Putin 'very soon'

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he could meet "very soon" with Vladimir Putin, adding he believes his Russian counterpart genuinely wants to stop fighting in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No time set, but it could be very soon," Trump told reporters, hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to play down expectations of upcoming high-level talks in Riyadh on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Rubio set to lead a high-level American delegation at the discussions with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia's capital in the coming days, a flurry of diplomacy was taking place as the Ukraine war nears its third anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, addressing reporters after a flight on Air Force One, said his team had been speaking "long and hard" with Russian officials, including his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff whom the president said met with Putin for about three hours recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he wants to stop fighting," Trump said of Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he believes Putin wants to seize the entirety of Ukraine, Trump said: "That was my question to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If he's going to go on... that would have caused me a big problem," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he wants to end it, and they want to end it fast. Both of them," he said, adding "Zelensky wants to end it too."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile said Sunday he believed Russia was preparing to "wage war" against a weakened NATO should Trump dilute US support for the alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump appeared to dismiss Zelensky's remarks, telling reporters he was "not even a little bit" concerned about the Ukrainian leader's messaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio is set to lead a high-level US team to Riyadh, but it remains unclear whether there will be any Ukrainian participation. Rubio said he wasn't even sure who Moscow was sending. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a united front on Sunday against their common enemies, threatening to "open the gates of hell" on Hamas and "finish the job" against Iran.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pledges came during a joint address to reporters in Jerusalem, where Rubio began his first Middle East trip as Secretary of State in President Donald Trump's new administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas cannot continue as a military or a government force... they must be eliminated," Rubio said of the Palestinian Islamist group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comment came a day after Hamas freed three Israeli hostages in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners, the sixth such swap under the ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of ceasefire violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding to strain on the deal, Trump has made a widely-condemned proposal to take control of Gaza and relocate its more than two million residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanking Rubio for "unequivocal backing" for Israel's policy in Gaza, Netanyahu added that Israel and the United States are determined to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions and its "aggression" in the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel and America stand shoulder to shoulder in countering the threat of Iran," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agreed that the ayatollahs must not have nuclear weapons and also agreed that Iran's aggression in the region must be rolled back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli-Iranian enmity stretches back decades through a history of clandestine wars and attacks by land, sea, air and cyberspace.
  <br>

    Doctors tell Pope Francis to preserve strength

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis sat out mass and his traditional Angelus prayer from hospital on Sunday, with a Vatican health official saying the 88-year-old pontiff needed to preserve his strength for the Church's busy Jubilee year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis was admitted on Friday to Rome's Gemelli hospital with bronchitis, one of several bouts of flu or bronchitis he has caught in recent winters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican said Saturday that doctors prescribed "absolute rest", although they said tests had indicated some improvements in his condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to attend Sunday mass at St Peter's Basilica, the pope sent a written address to a group of artists and other cultural figures in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would have liked to be among you but, as you know, I am here at the Gemelli Hospital because I still need some treatment for my bronchitis," Francis wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the mass -- which is usually presided over by the pope -- Cardinal Jose Tolentino de Mendonca read Francis's homily.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We live in a time when new walls are being erected, when differences become a pretext for division rather than an opportunity for mutual enrichment," the cardinal read. "But you, men and women of the world of culture, are called to build bridges."
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the health office for the Italian Bishops' Conference, Massimo Angelelli, told AFPTV it was "absolutely necessary for him to recover his strength" as "the Jubilee is still long."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Catholic Church has designated 2025 a "Jubilee Year" that is expected to draw more than 30 million visitors to Rome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Occurring every 25 years, the Jubilee is intended as a period of reflection and penance, and marked by a long list of cultural and religious events -- many of them presided over by the pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite his health issues -- which include knee pain and his reliance on a wheelchair -- the pope keeps a very busy schedule and has said he has no current plans to slow down.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the days ahead of his hospitalisation, Francis -- who had part of one of his lungs removed as a young man -- several times asked aides to read his public speeches aloud on his behalf.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the Vatican said in a statement that tests had confirmed the pope was suffering from a "respiratory tract infection" but was not exhibiting signs of fever, and showed "improvement in some values". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Mauritius arrested the island's former prime minister Pravind Jugnauth in a money-laundering probe and seized stacks of cash from a business linked to him, they said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers arrested the 63-year-old along with his wife Kobita Jugnauth in the early hours of Sunday and questioned him for several hours, police sources who asked not to be named told AFP. Kobita Jugnauth was later released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pravind Jugnauth was due to appear before a judge later in the morning, the sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police incident report seen by AFP detailed a search by officers at the home of another suspect, in which documents were found bearing the names of the Jugnauths, as well as luxury watches and stacks of various currencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The island's Financial Crimes Commission had asked police to detain the Jugnauths and two other suspects if they tried to leave the country, in a notice issued on Saturday, citing investigations into "a case of money-laundering".
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime minister from 2017 to 2024, Pravind Jugnauth is a member of one of the dynasties that have dominated the leadership of Mauritius since it became independent from Britain in 1968.
  <br>
  <br>
  He oversaw a historic deal with Britain for Mauritius to regain sovereignty over the Chagos Islands following a long-running dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his Militant Socialist Movement suffered a crushing defeat in tense elections in November. He ceded office to centre-left rival Navin Ramgoolam, who became prime minister for the third time.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the campaign, both camps promised to improve the lives of ordinary Mauritians who face cost-of-living difficulties despite strong economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Chagos deal, Britain will retain a lease for a joint US military base on the island of Diego Garcia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Mauritius and Britain have said US President Donald Trump's administration will have a say on the final terms of the agreement. (AFP)

<img alt='British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says London "will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together". File photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791827_1_20250216082626.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European leaders on Saturday mobilised to force their way to the table at any talks on the Ukraine war, as Washington announced a team of senior US officials was planning to meet in Saudi Arabia with counterparts from Moscow and Kiev.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump upended the status quo this week when he announced he was likely to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin soon to start talks to end the conflict, leaving US allies in Europe reeling from concerns that their interests would be sidelined in any deal on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will head to Saudi Arabia for ceasefire talks with Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, US officials said on Saturday, without giving details on when the meeting would happen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio had already been due to visit Saudi Arabia as part his first tour of the Middle East, which began on Saturday when he arrived in Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top US diplomat also had a call on Saturday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, in which he "reaffirmed President Trump's commitment to finding an end to the conflict in Ukraine," spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Munich, Nato chief Mark Rutte said Europe had to come up with "good proposals" for securing peace in Ukraine if it wanted to be involved in US-led talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Europeans want to have a say, make yourself relevant," Rutte told journalists at a gathering of top policymakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rutte also said he would head to Paris on Monday to take part in a meeting of European leaders convened by French President Emmanuel Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gathering would focus on defence spending and planning so that "when a deal is reached in Ukraine, that we have absolute clarity what Europe can contribute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Europe "must take on a greater role in Nato" and work with the United States to "secure Ukraine's future".
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Starmer said: "This is a once in a generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russi
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of any eventual "security guarantees" for Ukraine, talks have begun in Europe over a potential deployment of peacekeepers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But those discussions are at an embryonic stage -- and others argue the focus needs to be on building up Ukraine's own forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for the creation of a European army, arguing the continent could no longer count on Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really believe that time has come. The Armed Forces of Europe must be created."
  <br>
  <br>
  The push for a joint continental force has been mooted for years without gaining traction and Zelensky's intervention seems unlikely to shift the balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's rallying cry came a day after he met US Vice President JD Vance as Kyiv scrambles to ensure it is not sidelined in Washington's push to wrap up the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement," Zelensky said in a speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. No decisions about Europe without Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, gave Europeans reasons to doubt they would be heard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe would not be directly involved in talks but would still have an "input", Kellogg said in Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials have sought to assure Ukraine that it will not be left in the cold after three years of battling Russia's invasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance said after his sit-down with Zelensky that the United States was looking for a "durable, lasting peace" that would not lead to further bloodshed in coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Washington has sent mixed messages to Kyiv, with Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth appearing to rule out Ukraine joining Nato or having all of its territoroy restoreD.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also pushed for access to Ukraine's stocks of rare earth minerals as compensation for the military aid provided by the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said ON Saturday he blocked a deal that would have given the US access to vast amounts of Ukrainian natural resources as it lacked "security guarantees" for Kyiv. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 14-year-old boy died, and five other people were injured in a knife attack in southern Austria on Saturday, police said, adding they have arrested a 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A man randomly attacked passersby with a knife," police spokesman Rainer Dionisio told AFP of the incident in the city of Villach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One victim, a 14-year-old boy, died," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other men suffered serious injuries, while another two men were lightly injured, Dionisio added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened on Saturday just before 4pm local time (2300 HKT) in the centre of the city, the capital of Carinthia Province.
  <br>
  <br>
  A food delivery rider saw the attack and rammed his vehicle into the attacker, who was lightly injured and was arrested "right after the attack," according to Dionisio.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man under arrest is a Syrian asylum seeker with a valid residence permit and without a criminal record, according to preliminary information, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest victim was the 14-year-old, while the oldest is 32 years old, he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to start talks aimed at ending Moscow's nearly three-year war in Ukraine, a US lawmaker and a source familiar with the planning said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who met with US Vice President JD Vance in Germany on Friday, said Ukraine was not invited to the talks in Saudi Arabia and Kyiv would not engage with Russia before consulting with strategic partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Saudi Arabia, US Representative Michael McCaul told Reuters. It was not immediately clear who they would meet from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, McCaul said the aim of the talks was to arrange a meeting between US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy "to finally bring peace and end this conflict."
  <br>
  <br>
  A source with knowledge of the plans confirmed the planned talks in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials. The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who took office on January 20, has repeatedly vowed to swiftly end the Ukraine war. He made separate phone calls to Putin and Zelenskiy on Wednesday, leaving Washington's European allies alarmed that they will be cut out of any peace process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those fears were largely confirmed on Saturday when Trump's Ukraine envoy said Europe won't have a seat at the table, after Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Saturday Rubio spoke with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. They agreed on regular contacts to prepare for a meeting between Putin and Trump, Russia's Foreign Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelenskiy said on Friday he would visit the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, but did not say when. However, the Ukrainian leader said he had no plans to meet with US or Russian officials during those visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow controls a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly advancing in the east for months, while Kyiv's smaller army grapples with manpower shortages and tries to hold a chunk of territory in western Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has demanded Kyiv cede territory and become permanently neutral under any peace deal. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured land and wants NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent attack by Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States and Europe have given Ukraine tens of billions of dollars in military aid since the war started. Trump has said he backs Ukraine but is seeking security for US funding for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and Ukraine are currently negotiating a deal that could open up Ukraine's vast natural wealth to US investment. Three sources said the US proposed taking ownership of 50 percent of Ukraine's critical minerals. Zelenskiy said on Saturday that the draft deal did not contain the security provisions Kyiv needed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK government on Saturday named two Britons detained in Iran as Craig and Lindsay Foreman, with their family saying they are determined to ensure the pair's "safe return."
 <br>
  <br>
  The two are currently being held in the city of Kerman, the family said in a statement issued by the British foreign ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The family added that it was "united in our determination to secure their safe return."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We truly appreciate the outpouring of support from friends, family, and the community, which has provided us with strength and encouragement as we face this ordeal," said the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple are in their early 50s and were on a motorbike tour around the world when they were detained in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Foreign Office confirmed on Friday that it was "providing consular assistance to two British nationals detained in Iran" and was in contact with Iranian authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after Iran's official news agency IRNA reported on Thursday that two British nationals were being held in central Kerman province for unspecified security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK government advises against all travel to Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  It says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are "at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention."
  <br>
  <br>
  Several other Europeans are held in custody in Iran, which has conducted multiple prisoner exchanges with Western governments in recent years. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday said that Germany rejects "outsiders intervening in our democracy," a day after US Vice President JD Vance in a blistering speech told Europe to open the door to far-right parties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholz, who faces elections on February 23, spoke in Munich where Vance on Friday launched his broadside against Germany and the EU on immigration, free speech and other topics in a speech later praised by US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance also met Alice Weidel, the top candidate of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has also received strong backing from technology billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Scholz pushed back against Vance's speech and defended Germany's taboo against cooperating with extremist parties, often dubbed a "firewall."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not accept outsiders intervening in our democracy, in our elections," Scholz said. "That is not appropriate – especially not among friends and allies."
  <br>
  <br>
  France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also defended European policies after Vance's speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Freedom of expression is guaranteed in Europe," Barrot said on X, after Vance alleged it was "in retreat." "Nobody is obliged to adopt our model, but nobody can impose theirs on us," the French minister added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz started his speech by mentioning Vance's earlier visit to the Nazis' Dachau concentration camp near Munich, and the US vice president's commitment to "never again" allow such crimes to be committed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Holocaust was the reason "the vast majority of Germans are firmly opposed to those who glorify or justify" the Nazis, Scholz said, recalling that AfD senior figures have trivialised Nazi crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A commitment to 'never again' cannot be reconciled with support for the AfD," Scholz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later stressed that "we are absolutely clear that the extreme right should stay outside the political decision-making process and that there would be no cooperation with them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance had criticised Germany for excluding parties that voice strong concerns over immigration and argued that "democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no room for firewalls," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash between the traditional allies comes just over a week before German national elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz's centre-left Social Democrats are currently third in the polls at around 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race is being led by the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, whose support stands at around 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AfD is expected to score its best-ever national result, now polling in second place at around 20 percent. (AFP)

    Zelensky calls for creation of European army

<img alt="Ukraine's president tells the Munich Security Conference that Europe needs its own army. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791790_1_20250215191907.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday Ukraine would never accept any peace deal reached behind its back or without Kyiv's involvement – an implicit message to US President Donald Trump as he strives to end the war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech to the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky also called on Europe to create its own armed forces, urging the continent's leaders to decide their own future and saying Ukraine's armed forces alone were not enough for their security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky spoke after Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, the first between US and Russian leaders since Russia's February 2022 full-scale assault on Ukraine, and said he and Putin expected to meet in the future, probably in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has repeatedly said it wants to come together with the United States and Europe to devise a joint strategy before any Trump-Putin meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration so far has left the impression among some European allies that it was making concessions to Putin at Ukraine's expense before any negotiations begin, though remarks by some top US officials have raised confusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky predicted that the Kremlin would try to persuade Trump to attend Russia's May 9 commemorations in Moscow, when it marks the Soviet victory in World War Two with an annual military parade through Red Square.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky told the conference that he believed it would be "dangerous" if Trump met Putin before he and Trump meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  To Europe's leaders, he issued warnings, asking rhetorically whether their armies would be ready if Moscow launched an open or "false-flag" attack. The latter is designed to look like it was perpetrated by someone other than the group responsible for it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If this (Ukraine-Russia) war ends the wrong way, he (Putin) will have a surplus of battle-tested soldiers who know nothing but killing and looting," he said, citing intelligence reports saying Russia will dispatch its troops to Belarus this summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And now, as we fight this war and lay the groundwork for peace and security, we must build the Armed Forces of Europe." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged Nato to adopt a "rational and pragmatic" attitude and establish an "objective and correct understanding" of China, the foreign ministry said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the comment to Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte on Friday, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Beijing will continue to work with other parties to play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier at the conference, the top diplomat said China will work with like-minded countries to promote a stable and orderly multi-polar world as well as an inclusive and tolerant economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted that China maintains a consistent and stable policy toward the United States, which will continue to be guided by the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation. (Agencies)

    EU 'urgently' considering options to DRC fighting

<img alt="Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of Republic of Congo attends a meeting during the 38th Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791782_1_20250215173727.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU said on Saturday it was "urgently" considering all options in response to a widening rebel offensive in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, after Rwandan-backed forces seized a second major city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Having captured the key provincial capital of Goma last month, M23 fighters pushed south and took a vital airport before marching virtually unchecked into another key city, Bukavu, on Friday, according to security and humanitarian sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Alarmed by news of Rwandan backed M23 forces seizing Kavumu airport and entering Bukavu, ignoring international appeals for ceasefire," European Commission spokesman Anouar El Anouni wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EU urgently considers all the means at its disposal. The ongoing violation of the DRC's territorial integrity will not go unanswered."
  <br>
  <br>
  The warning comes as the conflict is set to dominate an African Union summit that opened on Saturday in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa with UN chief Antonio Guterres saying a regional escalation "must be avoided at all costs".
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows an appeal from the European Parliament, which this week urged the EU to suspend a minerals deal with Rwanda in response to Kigali's involvement in the offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers in Strasbourg on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a non-binding resolution which also called for the bloc's 27 member states to freeze all direct budget support as well as military and security assistance to Rwanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rwanda denies giving military support to the M23 but has accused extremist Hutu groups in DR Congo of threatening its security.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report by UN experts said last year Kigali maintained around 4,000 troops in DR Congo and had de facto control of the rebel group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conflict has killed thousands and driven vast numbers from their homes. (AFP)

    3 Israeli hostages released, 369 Palestinians freed

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli hostages Iair Horn, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Sasha (Alexander) Troufanov arrived at a release site in Gaza on Saturday after Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped avert a standoff that threatened to sink a fragile ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters led the three onto a stage at the site in Gaza's Khan Younis, live footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three have been returned in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, a swap which eases fears that the agreement could collapse before the end of a 42-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas had earlier threatened not to release more hostages after it accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire by blocking aid from entering Gaza, drawing counter-threats of a resumption of fighting from Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emaciated appearance of three hostages released last week and accounts of abuse by other hostages released since January 19 when the ceasefire took effect has set off Israeli protests demanding that the government stick to the ceasefire and proceed with the next stage of the deal to bring all the hostages home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prospects for the ceasefire surviving have also been clouded by U.S. President Donald Trump's call for Palestinians to be moved permanently out of Gaza, and for the enclave to be turned over to the United States to be redeveloped. That call was strongly rejected by Palestinian groups, Arab states and Western allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce was intended to open the way for a second phase of negotiations to return remaining hostages and complete the withdrawal of Israeli forces before a final end to the war and the rebuilding of Gaza, which now lies largely in ruins, facing shortages of food, running water and electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas threat to hold off from releasing more hostages followed its accusation that Israel had blocked tents and temporary shelter materials from entering into Gaza, leaving tens of thousands exposed to the winter cold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel rejected the accusation, saying it had allowed thousands of aid trucks in. Hamas on Saturday said it expects Israel to meet its aid obligations for the ceasefire to stay on track. (Reuters)

    OpenAI board rejects Elon Musk-led buyout offer

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI's board chairman on Friday said it has unanimously rejected an Elon Musk-led offer to buy the hot artificial intelligence company for US$97.4 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  "OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition," chairman of the board Bret Taylor said in a statement posted by the company on Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI (artificial general intelligence) benefits all of humanity," the statement continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk filed court documents on Wednesday saying that he would withdraw the offer to buy OpenAI if its board returns the artificial intelligence pioneer to a non-profit "charity" model.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI currently operates a hybrid structure, as a non-profit with a money-making subsidiary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The change to a for-profit model, one that Altman considers crucial for the company's development, had exacerbated ongoing tensions with Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and Altman were among the 11-person team that founded OpenAI in 2015, with the former providing initial funding of US$45 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three years later, Musk departed the company, with OpenAI citing "a potential future conflict for Elon... as Tesla continues to become more focused on AI."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk established his own artificial intelligence company called xAI early in 2023 after OpenAI ignited global fervor over the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The massive costs of designing, training, and deploying AI models have compelled OpenAI to seek a new corporate structure that would give investors equity and provide more stable governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transition to a traditional for-profit company requires approval from California and Delaware authorities, who will scrutinize how the non-profit arm of OpenAI is valued when it becomes a shareholder in the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current investors prefer a lower valuation to maximize their share of the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics say Musk's bid, valuing the OpenAI non-profit at US$97.4 billion - approximately US$30 billion above the level in current negotiations, according to The Information - appears designed to disrupt the company's fundraising efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI's Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane has said Musk's offer came from a competitor "who has struggled to keep up with the technology and compete with us in the marketplace". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas fighters are will release three Israeli hostages on Saturday in exchange for 369 Palestinians in Israeli custody, the sixth swap of a truce that came close to collapse this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of violating the January 19 ceasefire, with the Palestinian group saying it would pause releases and Israel threatening the resumption of war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Friday both sides signalled that the hostage release scheduled for Saturday would go ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group said that Israel was to release 369 inmates in exchange, with 24 of them expected to be deported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority, 333 people, are "prisoners from the Gaza Strip who were arrested after October 7", the group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the crisis that appeared to bring the fragile truce to a breaking point, Hamas said on Friday it expected talks on a second phase of the ceasefire to begin early next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose country is Israel's top backer and has been involved in mediation efforts during the war, is due to arrive in Israel late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week's release sparked anger in Israel and beyond, with the emaciated state of the freed Israeli hostages sparking concern over conditions in captivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also fears for Palestinians in Israeli custody after some prisoners required medical treatment on their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire has been under massive strain since US President Donald Trump proposed a takeover of the Gaza Strip under which the territory's population of more than two million would be moved to Egypt or Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any forced displacement evokes memories of the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of their ancestors during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab countries have come together to reject the plan, and Saudi Arabia will host the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday for a summit on the issue. (AFP)

 President Trump said on Friday that he planned to unveil tariffs on imported cars around April 2, adding to a cascade of levies he has threatened since taking office.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's statement did not specify whether the tariffs would apply to all auto imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since his inauguration on January 20, Trump has taken aim at allies and adversaries alike with threats of fresh duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has referred to tariffs as a way to raise revenue, remedy trade imbalances and pressure countries to act on US concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have warned that the tariffs will be passed on to American consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked when he might unveil auto tariffs, Trump said, "Maybe around April 2."
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not provide further details on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of the cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada and the other half from other major auto-producing countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latter group is led by Japan, South Korea and Germany, with Britain, Italy and Sweden a source of a smaller volume of imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent days, Ford CEO Jim Farley has blasted a proposed Trump tariff of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada, noting that it disadvantages US companies that have integrated their supply chains across North America under trade agreements, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) negotiated in the first Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  On February 3, the White House suspended the tariffs for 30 days following moves from Canada and Mexico on border security and fentanyl policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Levies targeting the auto sector would come after the president recently firmed up plans for tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports beginning March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has previously promised tariffs on semiconductors, steel, oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, in a move broadening trade conflicts, Trump launched plans for "reciprocal tariffs" that could hit all US trading partners on a country-by-country basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, has called for Trump to drop proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We support President Trump's efforts to consider the entire global trade situation, including both tariff and non-tariff barriers," said AAPC President Matt Blunt on Thursday in response to the announcement on reciprocal tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the meantime, Ford, GM, and Stellantis continue to believe that vehicles and auto parts that meet the USMCA requirements should not be subject to additional tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AAPC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. (AFP)

    Vance, Zelensky meet for talks to end war

 US Vice President JD Vance pledged on Friday that Washington sought to secure a "lasting" peace as he held a first meeting with Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss Donald Trump's push for a deal with Moscow.
 <br>
  <br>
  The talks in Munich were seen as a key moment for Kyiv as it tried to keep Washington on its side after Trump stunned allies by announcing peace efforts with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to achieve a durable, lasting peace, not the kind of peace that's going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple of years down the road," Vance said as the meeting wrapped up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said "good conversations" had been had with Zelensky about how they could reach that goal, and they would have more talks "in the days, weeks, and months to come.".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky also hailed a "good conversation," saying the encounter with Vance was "our first meeting, not last, I'm sure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to move as quickly as possible towards a real and guaranteed peace," Zelensky wrote later on X, adding that an envoy from Washington would visit Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump rattled Ukraine and its European allies on Wednesday by agreeing to launch peace talks in his first publicly announced call with Putin since returning to office.
  <br>
  <br>
  After nearly three years of war of frosty relations, the dramatic thaw in US-Russia relations sparked fears that Ukraine could be left behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials have insisted that Zelensky will be involved in negotiations—and the Ukrainian leader said he would be prepared to sit down with Putin after agreeing to a "common plan" with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only in this case I'm ready to meet," Zelensky told the Munich Security Conference before seeing Vance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance said ahead of the meeting that the United States was prepared to pressure Russia, adding that Europe should "of course" be at the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also told Europe to "step up" on bolstering its own defence to allow Washington to focus on threats elsewhere in the world. (AFP)

    Drone damages outer shell of Chernobyl nuclear plant

<img alt="Ukraine said that a Russian drone had struck a cover built to contain radiation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791695_1_20250214213154.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A drone armed with a warhead hit the outer protective shell of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant on Friday, damaging the structure and briefly starting a fire, in an attack Kyiv blamed on Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin denied it was responsible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Radiation levels at the shuttered plant in the Kyiv region — site of the world's worst nuclear accident — have not increased, according to the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, which said the strike did not breach the plant's inner containment shell.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IAEA did not attribute blame, saying only that its team stationed at the site heard an explosion and was informed that a drone had struck the shell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting around nuclear power plants has repeatedly raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe during three years of war, particularly in a country where many vividly remember living through the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which killed at least 30 people and spewed radioactive fallout over much of the Northern Hemisphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is Europe’s biggest, has occasionally been hit by drones during the war without causing significant damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike came two days after US President Donald Trump upended American policy on Ukraine, saying he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move seemed to identify Putin as the only player that matters and looked set to sideline Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as European governments, in any peace talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said a Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead hit the plant's outer shell and started a fire, which had been put out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shell was built in 2016 over another heavy concrete containment structure, which was placed on the plant’s fourth reactor soon after the 1986 disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both shells seek to prevent radiation leaks. (AP)

    Japan to release emergency rice reserves

<img alt="A five-kilo bag was selling for 3,688 yen (US$24) in the last week of January, according to a government survey, up from 2,023 yen last year. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791673_1_20250214183636.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Japanese government on Friday said it would release a fifth of its emergency rice stockpile after hot weather, poor harvests and panic buying over a "megaquake" warning nearly doubled prices over a year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan has previously tapped into its reserves to cope with disasters, but this marked the first time since the stockpile was built in 1995 that it was doing so because of supply chain problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some supermarket shelves were emptied in August of rice following a week-long holiday, a series of typhoons and warnings of a looming major earthquake that has so far failed to materialise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had initially hoped prices would stabilise late last year once newly harvested rice arrived in stores, but inflation continued unabated, this time because some distributors were hoarding for fear of running out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Agriculture Minister Taku Eto told reporters on Friday the government would release 210,000 tonnes of rice from its stock of one million tonnes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope you will take this as our strong determination to improve at all costs the situation where distribution has been delayed and stuck," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice prices had already began to change consumption patterns for some like Tokyo resident Eriko Kato.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still do buy rice occasionally, but since it's so expensive I sometimes give up on buying it once I see the price," Kato, 41, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A five-kilogramme bag was retailing at 3,688 yen (US$24) in the last week of January, according to a government survey, up from 2,023 yen last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice consumption in Japan has more than halved in the past 60 years to about 50.9 kilos in 2022, but the grain remains deeply ingrained in Japanese culture and its harvesting has shaped the nation's landscape -- even being used in Shinto rituals. (AFP)

    Vance to clarify Trump Ukraine peace plan in Munich

<img alt="US Vice President JD Vance will meet Ukraine's president in Munich where the pair will discuss Washington's efforts to end the conflict between Kyiv and Moscow. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791648_1_20250214165245.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance will lead America's delegation to the Munich Security Conference that starts on Friday in the southern German city, where world leaders and diplomats are gathering amid intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration's foreign policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The future of Ukraine will be the top item on the agenda following a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, when they pledged to work together to end the three-year-old Russia-Ukraine conflict .
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday for talks that many — particularly in Europe — hope will shed at least some light on Trump’s ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was supposed to join them but was delayed when his Air Force plane had to return to Washington after developing a mechanical problem en route to Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Department said he would take a different aircraft, but it was unclear whether he would arrive in time for the meeting with Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who upended years of steadfast US support for Ukraine during his call with Putin on Wednesday, has been vague about his specific intentions — other than suggesting that a deal will likely result in Ukraine being forced to cede territory that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Ukraine war has to end,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “Young people are being killed at levels that nobody’s seen since World War II. And it’s a ridiculous war.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russia-Ukraine war is the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi will also be in Munich to communicate Beijing's position on global security.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Ukraine, state media cited Wang as saying China welcomes all efforts committed to peace talks and supports building a "balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people were killed and more than two dozen were injured when a blaze ripped through a hotel construction site in the South Korean port city of Busan on Friday, the National Fire Agency said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire started just before 11am local time at the construction site of the Banyan Tree Hotel, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 workers were present when the blaze erupted, a National Fire Agency official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-five people were injured, a public health department official said, adding that most were minor injuries caused by smoke inhalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fire had already reached its peak by the time we arrived and thick black smoke was covering the scene," Busan Gijang Fire Station chief Hong Mun-sik told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were many flammable materials blocking the entrance," Hong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out on the first floor of the building where workers had stored insulation materials, Hong said, and the fatalities occurred where the fire started.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The exact cause and location of the fire need to be thoroughly investigated," Hong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire was brought under control around 1.30pm. (AFP)

    Trump signs plan for reciprocal tariffs on US partners

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump inked plans on Thursday for sweeping "reciprocal tariffs" that could hit both allies and competitors, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said he had decided to impose reciprocal duties, telling reporters that US allies were often "worse than our enemies" on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’ve decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff," Trump said at the proclamation signing. “It’s fair to all. No other country can complain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, he called the European Union "absolutely brutal" in trade ties with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the memo Trump signed on Thursday, officials - including the US trade representative and commerce secretary - will propose remedies on a country-by-country basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick said that studies should be completed by April 1, and the president could start tariffs as early as April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the EU, the White House also flagged differences in certain US tariff levels with India and Brazil, while noting Japan's "high structural barriers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists caution that sweeping tariffs on US imports would likely boost inflation, not reduce it, in the near term and could weigh on growth eventually.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump acknowledged on Thursday that US prices "could go up" due to tariffs, but he expressed confidence that they would ultimately ease. (Agencies)

    Modi, Trump agree to trade talks

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump greeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House with a bear hug on Thursday and called him “a great friend of mine," but nonetheless warned that India won't be spared from higher tariffs he's begun imposing on US trade partners around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who had previously derided India as the “tariff king,” called the import levies imposed by Modi's country “very unfair and strong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Whatever India charges, we charge them,” Trump said at a joint news conference where he stood next to Modi. “So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge.”
  <br>
  <br>
  As he has while recently hosting other foreign leaders, Trump talked about ensuring that the US erases its trade deficit with India. He suggested that could be done by increasing US energy exports to India but also promised to restore “fairness and reciprocity” to the economic relationship and said he and Modi had begun working on a major trade deal that could be completed later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and India have a trade deficit of US$50 billion in India’s favour. Goods and services trade between the two countries totalled around US$190.1 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to India’s External Affairs Ministry, US exports to India were worth nearly US$70 billion, and imports US$120 billion.

  <br>
  Modi, the fourth world leader to visit the White House since Trump's return, described him as a friend and told him he was adopting a take on his "Make America Great Again" slogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining Trump's meeting with Modi was SpaceX and Tesla tycoon Elon Musk. Modi also met one-on-one with Musk, raising questions over whether the world's richest man was meeting the Indian leader in an official or business capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indian premier posted pictures of himself shaking hands with the beaming Musk, with several children on Musk's side of the room, and Indian officials on the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi, a prolific user of Musk-owned social media platform X, said later that he had known Musk before he became prime minister. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he wants to restart nuclear arms control talks with Russia and China and that eventually he hopes all three countries could agree to cut their massive defence budgets in half.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump lamented the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in rebuilding the nation's nuclear deterrent and said he hoped to gain commitments from Russia and China to cut their own spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There’s no reason for us to be building brand new nuclear weapons, we already have so many,” Trump said. “You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully much more productive," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said if the weapons were ever called to use, “that’s going to be probably oblivion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two countries once “we straighten it all out" in the Middle East and Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia. And I want to say, ‘let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I think we’ll be able to.” (Agencies)

    Vaccine critic RFK Jr sworn in as US health secretary

<div class="itemFullText">
 Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine critic who has pledged to tackle chronic disease, was named US Health Secretary on Thursday after overcoming resistance from the medical establishment and members of Congress with promises to limit his role in vaccination policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  As Kennedy was sworn into the post, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to "Make America Healthy Again," that would investigate chronic illness and deliver an action plan to fight childhood diseases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy said on Thursday his first priorities would be around "radical transparency" and removing those in the government who had conflicts of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 20 years, I've gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I could end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country. On August 23 of last year, God sent me President Trump," Kennedy said, referring to when he dropped his independent presidential bid and endorsed the Republican candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Senate earlier on Thursday voted to confirm Kennedy 52-48, with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the lone Republican joining all 47 Democrats to vote against Kennedy, who had made pledges to protect existing vaccination programmes in a bid to secure votes of hesitant lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy will now oversee multiple high-profile agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy, 71, is an environmental lawyer who has long sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevented millions of deaths for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will now run the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that directs more than US$3 trillion in healthcare spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also under HHS purview are the Medicare and Medicaid programmes that provide health insurance for over 140 million Americans and the National Institutes of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to pledging to work to end chronic disease, Kennedy has said he wants to break any ties between employees at the US drugs regulator and industry. (Reuters)

    Foreign Minister Wang Yi in UK for talks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Britain need to strengthen strategic communication, enhance mutual trust and demonstrate responsibility as major countries, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a meeting with the UK prime minister on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang is visiting London for a strategic dialogue with the British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, at which both sides agreed to speed up preparations for institutional dialogues on the economy and trade, health and industrial cooperation, the Foreign Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lammy hosted talks with Wang as the pair revived the China-UK Strategic Dialogue, a bilateral forum that was last held in 2018 before it stalled as relations soured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer "dropped in" to a meeting between Wang and UK National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell, a Downing Street spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer "underlined his intention to build a consistent and respectful relationship between the UK and China" and "reiterated that the UK will always engage frankly on the areas where our views differ," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides exchanged in-depth views on the Ukraine crisis, with Wang stressing "no expansion of the battlefields, no escalation of hostilities, and no fanning flames."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said China welcomed efforts committed to peace talks and supported the building of a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour government, elected in July, has sought to improve the UK's relationship with Beijing after the two countries fell out during the latter years of Conservative rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major thawing of tensions, Starmer and President Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit last November - the first bilateral meeting between leaders of the two countries since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance minister Rachel Reeves then visited China last month seeking investment to kickstart growth in Britain's economy, while Lammy visited Beijing in October. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge humpback whale briefly scooped a kayaker in its mouth in the seas off the coast of southern Chile before spitting him out unscathed in a dramatic incident caught on camera.
 <br>
  <br>
  The kayaker, Adrian Simancas, was out with his father last weekend in the seas off the town of Punta Arenas, when the whale surfaced and scooped him up in his mouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt like I was being lifted, but it was clearly too strong to be a wave," said Simancas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I turned, I felt something blue and white passing close to my face, like on one side and above. I didn't understand what was happening. Then everything... I went under and thought I had been swallowed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Luckily, the whale quickly spat out Simancas unharmed. His father, in another kayak, caught the whole thing on camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I turned on the camera and heard a wave crash behind me, loudly. When I turned, I didn't see anything," said his father, Dell Simancas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that was the only moment of real fear because I didn't see Adrian for about three seconds. Then he suddenly shot out without the packraft, and a second later, the packraft emerged, and then I saw the fin of something."
  <br>
  <br>
  Adrian Simancas was sure he was going to die during the ordeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought I was done for, that I was dead. It was like three strange seconds down there," he said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 German authorities said a driver drove a car into a labour union demonstration in central Munich on Thursday, injuring at least 28 people including children.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said it was believed to be an attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, an Afghan asylum-seeker, was arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident follows a series of attacks involving immigrants in recent months that have pushed migration to the forefront of the campaign for Germany’s February 23 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said on social media platform X that the driver was “secured” and no longer posed any danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  A damaged Mini could be seen at the scene, along with debris including shoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter said he was “deeply shocked” by the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said participants in a demonstration by the service workers’ union ver.di were walking along a street at about 10.30am when the car overtook a police vehicle following the gathering, accelerated and plowed into the back of the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers arrested the suspect after firing a shot at the car, deputy police chief Christian Huber said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bavarian capital will see heavy security in the coming days because of the three-day Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of international foreign and security policy officials, which opens on Friday. (AP)

    'Europe must be involved in Ukraine peace talks'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Several Nato allies stressed on Thursday that Ukraine and Europe must not be cut out of any peace negotiations, after US President Donald Trump signalled that he would hold talks soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
 <br>
  <br>
  “Let’s not forget, Russia remains a threat well beyond Ukraine,” British Defence Secretary John Healey said after the United States rattled Nato by saying that Ukraine should never join the alliance and that European allies should take responsibility for Ukraine's security going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine. And Ukraine’s voice must be at the heart of any talks,” Healey told reporters at Nato's headquarters, as the organisation’s 32 defence ministers met for talks on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swedish Defence Minister Pål Jonson said European nations provided about 60 percent of the military support to Ukraine last year and must be involved, especially given US demands that Europe take more responsibility for Ukraine's security in the longer term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s very natural that we’re engaged into the discussions,” Jonson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Estonian counterpart, Hanno Pevkur, underlined that the European Union has driven sanctions against Russia, has invested heavily in Ukraine’s defence, and will be asked to foot the bill for rebuilding the war-ravaged country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to be there. So there is no question about it. Otherwise this peace will not be long lasting,” Pevkur warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Ukraine’s Western backers on Wednesday that Nato membership for Ukraine was unrealistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia and instead prepare for a negotiated peace settlement to be backed up by international troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  After talks with Putin and then Zelenskyy, Trump said on Wednesday he would “probably” meet in person with the Russian leader soon, and suggested that the meeting could happen in Saudi Arabia. (AP)

    North Korea demolishing family reunion centre: Seoul

<img alt="South Koreans had met with their North Korean relatives during separated family reunions at the Mount Kumgang resort. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791443_1_20250213113318.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea is demolishing a venue that for decades hosted tearful reunions of families separated by the Korean War and the division of the country, Seoul said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reunions in the North's Kumgang mountain, last held in 2018, were a testament to the devastating human cost of the Korean peninsula's division.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the meetings were subject to the vagaries of inter-Korea politics and often used as a negotiating tool by Pyongyang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The demolition of the Mount Kumgang Reunion Center is an inhumane act that tramples on the earnest wishes of separated families," a spokesperson for Seoul's unification ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea "sternly urges an immediate halt to such actions" and "expresses strong regret".
  <br>
  <br>
  "North Korea's unilateral demolition cannot be justified under any pretext, and the North Korean authorities must bear full responsibility for this situation," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 1988, around 130,000 South Koreans have registered their "separated families".
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 2025, around 36,000 of those individuals are still alive, according to official data. Seventy-five percent say they do not know if their relatives are alive or dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some were lucky enough to be chosen to take part in occasional crossborder reunions, mostly hosted at the Mount Kumgang resort.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea has been escalating its rhetoric against its southern neighbour in recent years, designating the south as a "hostile state".
  <br>
  <br>
  Pyongyang also blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border last year, which prompted South Korea's military to fire warning shots at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, Pyongyang scrapped a 2018 military accord designed to curb the risk of inadvertent clashes between two countries that remain technically at war, prompting the South to take a similar step. (Agencies)

 US President Donald Trump said both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on Wednesday, and Trump ordered top US officials to begin talks on ending the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The conversations came after Trump's defence secretary earlier said Kyiv would have to give up its long-held goals of joining the Nato military alliance and regaining all of its territory seized by Russia, signalling a dramatic shift in Washington's approach to the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He wants it to end. He doesn't want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after speaking with Putin for more than an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we're on the way to getting peace. I think President Putin wants peace, President Zelenskiy wants peace and I want peace. I just want to see people stop getting killed," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long said he would quickly end the war in Ukraine, without spelling out exactly how he would accomplish this.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin earlier said Putin and Trump had agreed to meet, and Putin had invited Trump to visit Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said their first meeting would "probably" take place soon in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on his social media platform, he said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would lead negotiations on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Zelenskiy spoke after Trump's call with Putin, and Zelenskiy's office said the conversation lasted for about an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a meaningful conversation with @POTUS. We... talked about opportunities to achieve peace, discussed our readiness to work together ...and Ukraine's technological capabilities... including drones and other advanced industries," Zelenskiy wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  No Ukraine peace talks have been held since the early months of the conflict, now approaching its third anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  European powers, including Britain, France and Germany, said on Wednesday they had to be part of any future negotiations on the fate of Ukraine, underscoring that only a fair accord with security guarantees would ensure lasting peace. They said they were ready to enhance support for Ukraine and put it in a position of strength. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's ousted President Yoon Seok Yeol faces potentially his last impeachment hearing on Thursday over his failed martial law bid before judges begin deliberations on whether to formally remove him from office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former prosecutor has remained defiant through weeks of hearings at Seoul's Constitutional Court, blaming a "malicious" opposition for his December bid to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attempt only lasted six hours as the opposition-led parliament voted the declaration down, later impeaching him over his attempt to impose martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was detained last month on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ousted president arrived at the court at around 9am local time (0000 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's hearing is set to hear evidence from the former chief of South Korea's intelligence service and one of the heads of Seoul's Capital Defence Command, the military unit dispatched to the parliament during the short-lived martial law bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is widely expected – but not officially confirmed – to be Yoon's last hearing before the court's judges go behind closed doors to deliberate whether to uphold his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  That process could take over a week to a fortnight – formerly impeached Presidents Park Geun-hye and Roh Moo-hyun had to wait 11 and 14 days, respectively, to learn their fates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many legal scholars and experts agree that a unanimous ruling in favour of impeachment will be made by the Constitutional Court judges," said Kim Hyun-jung, a researcher at the Korea University Institute of Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But experts also warn that political wrangling could hold up the trial – prominent conservative supporters of Yoon have called for more hearings to be held.
  <br>
  <br>
  An additional judge could also be approved to the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench, which is currently one member short.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the court upholds the impeachment, an election must be held within 60 days to choose a new president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Yoon's impeachment trial has centred on the question of whether he violated the constitution by declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suggested last week that even if he had ordered the arrest of MPs to prevent them from voting down his decree, it would not legally matter because it had not been carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also facing a criminal trial on insurrection charges, for which he faces a prison sentence or the death penalty. (AFP)
