<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Wednesday accused Russia of effectively rejecting a US-backed ceasefire proposal, reporting a barrage of strikes on civilian infrastructure hours after Moscow agreed only to pause attacks on the energy grid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington has been pushing for a full, 30-day ceasefire as a first step towards a wider settlement of the grinding three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in a 90-minute call with Donald Trump on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin refused, insisting that any such deal would be contingent on the West halting all military aid for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Kremlin, Putin has already ordered his military to pause strikes against Ukrainian energy targets for 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The highly anticipated Putin-Trump call also resulted in the announcement that Russia and Ukraine will exchange 175 prisoners each on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky welcomed the proposed energy truce but said he needed more "details" from Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has launched devastating attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the war, while Ukraine has used drones to bomb multiple Russian oil installations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions rang out and air raid sirens wailed in Ukraine just hours after Trump and Putin spoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said "there have been hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure", including a hospital in Sumy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is these types of nighttime attacks by Russia that destroy our energy sector, our infrastructure, and the normal life of Ukrainians," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Kyiv, Ukrainians were doubtful of any concessions from Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lev Sholoudko, 32 said he did not expect even the energy infrastructure would be spared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't believe Putin at all, not a single word. He only understands force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who says he has an "understanding" with Putin, has been seeking a breakthrough in the Ukraine war since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stunned the world when he announced he had started direct talks with Russia to end the conflict, sparking fears among allies that he was pivoting too far towards Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president hailed his latest call with Putin as "good and productive," and the White House said in a readout that the Russian leader had consented to a 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Moscow also underlined that a fuller truce was dependent on long-standing demands for a "complete cessation" of Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Kremlin statement also emphasised that Kyiv could not rearm or mobilise during any ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky, who accepted a full ceasefire proposal during talks in Saudi Arabia last week, has lashed out at Russia for its reluctance to reach a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are not ready to end this war, and we can see that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky also said that Ukrainian troops would continue fighting in Russia's Kursk region "as long as we need," following days of major Russian advances in the area that Kyiv partially seized last year. (AFP)

    Trump to unveil reciprocal tariffs on April 2

<img alt="US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said if countries stop their practices, the US would not put up the tariff wall. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796362_1_20250319092836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington is expected to present US trading partners on April 2 with a number representing their tariff and other barriers, as it unveils reciprocal levies tailored to each country, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump has promised reciprocal duties - on both US allies and competitors alike - from April 2, though his administration has yet to release the exact details of the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What's going to happen on April 2 - each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs," Bessent told Fox Business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added on "Mornings With Maria."
  <br>
  <br>
  With just over two weeks until April 2, he did not say whether those calculations would be complete for all nations by the deadline, but left open the door to some avoiding reciprocal tariffs on that date.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some duties "may not have to go on because a deal is pre-negotiated," he said, or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks once they receive their number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Monday on social media that April 2 would be "Liberation Day for America," promising to "start taking back some of the vast wealth that has been taken from us."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's tariff plans and the uncertainty surrounding them have shaken markets in recent weeks, fanning fears that an economic ebb could be in the cards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Bessent told Fox Business that he saw "no reason we need to have a recession," saying "the underlying economy is healthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former hedge fund manager raised the idea of a "pause" as the economy transitions away from "unsustainable" levels of government spending, pledging that the Trump administration would rein in expenditures and bring manufacturing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Bessent stressed that Trump has identified "critical industries" - like steel and aluminium among manufacturing sectors - for which he hopes to bring production back to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "we're going to take in substantial revenues," pointing to these as a means to offset the government deficit. (AFP)

    Record numbers forced to flee climate disasters: UN

<img alt="A man starts to rebuild his home in a shanty town destroyed by Cyclone Chido on the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte in January. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796360_1_20250319091826.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee climate disasters last year, the United Nations said on Wednesday, highlighting the urgent need for early warning systems covering the entire planet.
 <br>
  <br>
  Poorer countries are severely affected by cyclones, droughts, wildfires and other disasters, according to the State of the Global Climate annual report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN's weather and climate agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WMO said the record number of people fleeing climate disasters was based on figures from the International Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which has been collecting data on the subject since 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Mozambique, around 100,000 people were displaced by Cyclone Chido.
  <br>
  <br>
  But wealthy countries were also hit, with the WMO pointing to the floods in the Spanish city of Valencia, which killed 224 people, and the devastating fires in Canada and the United States which forced more than 300,000 people to flee their homes in search of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response, WMO and the global community are intensifying efforts to strengthen early warning systems and climate services," said the agency's chief Celeste Saulo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WMO wants everyone in the world covered by such systems by the end of 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides underlining the massive economic and social upheavals from extreme weather, the State of the Global Climate report said climate change indicators had once again reached record levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The clear signs of human-induced climate change reached new heights in 2024, with some of the consequences being irreversible over hundreds if not thousands of years," the WMO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2015 Paris climate accords aimed to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - and to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, and the first calendar year over the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold, with the global mean near-surface temperature 1.55 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average, according to an analysis compiling the six major international datasets.

    Supreme court chief chides Trump over impeachment call

<img alt="A brief statement from Chief Justice of the United States, John Roberts, said impeachment was not an appropriate response to disagreement. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796357_1_20250319090726.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday issued a rare public rebuke of President Donald Trump, over his call for the impeachment of a federal judge, in an extraordinary display of conflict between the executive and judiciary branches.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rebuke from the Supreme Court's leader demonstrated how controversy over recent flights of Venezuelan immigrants has inflamed tensions over the judiciary's role, with a legal case challenging Trump's actions now threatening to spiral into a clash of constitutional powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision," Roberts said in a brief statement. "The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  The rare statement came just hours after a social media post from Trump, who described US District Judge James E Boasberg as an unelected “troublemaker and agitator.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Boasberg had issued an order blocking deportation flights that Trump was carrying out by invoking wartime authorities from an 18th century law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been sharply critical of district courts which have blocked some of the president's executive actions but this was the first time Trump has personally called for a judge's impeachment since he took office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federal judges are nominated by the president for life and can only be removed by being impeached by the House of Representatives for "high crimes or misdemeanors" and convicted by the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impeachment of federal judges is exceedingly rare and the last time a judge was removed by Congress was in 2010. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Tuesday that massive overnight strikes on Gaza were "only the beginning" and that future negotiations with Hamas "will take place only under fire".
 <br>
  <br>
  The strikes, by far the largest since a truce took effect in January, killed more than 400 people across Gaza, according to its health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said in a video statement on Tuesday evening that "Hamas has already felt the strength of our arm in the past 24 hours. And I want to promise you - and them - this is only the beginning".
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations have stalled over how to proceed with a ceasefire whose first phase has expired, with Israel and Hamas disagreeing on whether to move to a new phase intended to bring the war to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli premier said in his address that "from now on, negotiations will take place only under fire," before adding: "Military pressure is essential for the release of additional hostages".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the return of all the hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the October 2023 attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has not responded militarily so far, and in a statement urged friendly countries to "pressure" the United States to bring to an end the strikes by its ally Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Israel consulted US President Donald Trump's administration before launching the strikes, while Israel said the return to fighting was "fully coordinated" with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  A State Department spokesperson said that "Hamas bears total responsibility... for the resumption of hostilities".
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations and countries around the world condemned the strikes, while the families of Israeli hostages pleaded with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt the violence, fearing for the fate of their loved ones. (AFP)

    US releases final trove of Kennedy assassination files

<img alt="Documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy are displayed after they were released. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796353_1_20250319084345.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US National Archives on Tuesday released the final batch of files related to the assassination of president John F Kennedy - a case that still fuels conspiracy theories more than 60 years after his death.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move follows an executive order issued by US President Donald Trump in January directing the unredacted release of the remaining files related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother, former attorney general Robert F Kennedy, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In accordance with President Donald Trump's directive... all records previously withheld for classification that are part of the President John F Kennedy Assassination Records Collection are released," the Archives said in a statement on its website on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Archives has released millions of pages of records over the past decades relating to the assassination of then-president Kennedy in November 1963, but thousands of documents had been held back at the request of the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation, citing national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warren Commission that investigated the shooting of the charismatic 46-year-old president determined that it was carried out by a former Marine sharpshooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that formal conclusion has done little to quell speculation that a more sinister plot was behind Kennedy's murder in Dallas, Texas, and the slow release of the government files has added fuel to various conspiracy theories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy scholars have said the documents that were still held by the archives were unlikely to contain any bombshell revelations or put to rest the rampant conspiracy theories about the assassination of the 35th US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oswald was shot by a strip club owner, Jack Ruby, on November 24, 1963 - two days after the Kennedy assassination - while being moved to a county jail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the records already released were raw intelligence, including scores of reports from FBI agents following up leads that led nowhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of what they contain was also previously known, such as that the communist-obsessed CIA cooked up several outlandish plots to murder Cuba's Fidel Castro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 but returned to the United States in 1962.
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of the documents follows an October 26, 1992 act of Congress which required that the unredacted assassination records held in the National Archives be released in full 25 years later. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned to Earth in a SpaceX capsule on Tuesday with a soft splashdown off Florida's coast, nine months after their faulty Boeing Starliner craft upended what was to be a week-long stay on the International Space Station.
 <br>
  <br>
  Their return caps a protracted space mission that was fraught with uncertainty and technical troubles and turned a rare instance of Nasa's contingency planning - and the latest failures of Boeing's Starliner - into a global spectacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams, two veteran Nasa astronauts and retired US Navy test pilots, had strapped inside their Crew Dragon spacecraft along with two other astronauts and undocked from the orbiting laboratory of the ISS at 1.05 a.m. ET (0505 GMT) to embark on a 17-hour trip to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-person crew, formally part of Nasa's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, re-entered Earth's atmosphere around 5:45 p.m. ET. Using Earth's atmosphere and two sets of parachutes, the craft slowed its orbital speed of roughly 17,000 miles per hour to a soft 17 miles per hour at splashdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dressed in re-entry suits, boots and helmets, the astronauts were seen earlier on Nasa's live footage laughing, hugging and posing for photos with their colleagues from the station shortly before they were shut into the capsule for two hours of final pressure, communications and seal tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The astronaut pair had launched into space as Starliner's first crew in June for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission. But issues with Starliner's propulsion system led to cascading delays to their return home, culminating in a Nasa decision last year to have them take a SpaceX craft back this year as part of the agency's crew rotation schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission has captured the attention of US President Donald Trump, who upon taking office in January called for a quicker return of Wilmore and Williams and alleged without evidence that former President Joe Biden "abandoned" them on the ISS for political reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, echoed his call for an earlier return. SpaceX's Crew Dragon is the United States' only orbital-class crew spacecraft, which Boeing had hoped its Starliner would compete with before the mission with Wilmore and Williams threw its development future into uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the splashdown, the astronauts will be flown to their crew quarters at the space agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston for several days of health checks, per routine for astronaut returns, before Nasa flight surgeons approve they can go home to their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Living in space for months can affect the human body in multiple ways, from muscle atrophy to possible vision impairment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams have logged 286 days in space on the mission - longer than the average six-month ISS mission length, but far short of US record holder Frank Rubio. His continuous 371 days in space, ending in 2023, were the unexpected result of a coolant leak on a Russian spacecraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams, capping her third spaceflight, has tallied 608 cumulative days in space, the second most for any US astronaut after Peggy Whitson's 675 days. Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko set the world record last year at 878 cumulative days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swept up in Nasa's routine astronaut rotation schedule, Wilmore and Williams could not begin their return to Earth until their replacement crew arrived, in order to maintain adequate US staffing levels, according to Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their replacements arrived on Friday night - four astronauts as part of Nasa's Crew-10 mission that briefly put the station's headcount at 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short," Wilmore told reporters from space earlier this month, adding that he did not believe Nasa's decision to keep them on the ISS until Crew-10's arrival had been affected by politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's what your nation's human spaceflight programme's all about," he said. "Planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams had been doing scientific research and conducting routine maintenance with the station's other five astronauts. Williams had performed two six-hour spacewalks for maintenance outside the ISS, including one with Wilmore.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ISS, about 254 miles (409 km) in altitude, is a football field-sized research lab that has been housed continuously by international crews of astronauts for nearly 25 years, a key platform of science diplomacy managed primarily by the US and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams told reporters earlier this month that she was looking forward to returning home to see her two dogs and family. "It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us," she said. (Reuters)

    Germany votes for big defence spending package

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German lawmakers gave the green light on Tuesday for a colossal spending boost for defence and infrastructure pushed by chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz amid deep fears in Europe over the future strength of the transatlantic alliance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unprecedented fiscal package – dubbed an "XXL-sized" cash "bazooka" by German media – could pave the way for more than one trillion euros in spending over the next decade in Europe's top economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The historic parliament vote signalled a radical departure for a country famously reluctant to take on large state debt – or to spend heavily on the armed forces, given its dark World War II history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz, who is expected to become Germany's next chancellor after his CDU/CSU alliance won last month's elections, argued that dramatic steps are needed at a time of geopolitical turmoil sparked by Russia's war with Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  European countries have been further unsettled by US President Donald Trump's outreach to Russia and signals of an uncertain commitment to Nato and Europe's defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to parliament, Merz cited Russia's "war of aggression against Europe" and said the funding boost would spell "the first major step towards a new European defence community".
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz's centre-right alliance and their likely future coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have hammered out the package over recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan would exempt defence spending above one percent of GDP from Germany's strict debt rules and set up a 500-billion-euro (US$545-billion) fund for infrastructure investments over 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the short term, Berlin looked set to soon approve an additional three billion euros in military aid for Ukraine. (AFP)

<img alt="The two spoke for more than an hour and a half, and both expressed hopes for repairing relations between the countries. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796323_1_20250319031834.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Tuesday on a halt in Russian attacks against Ukrainian energy targets – but fell far short of securing a full ceasefire in a highly anticipated phone call.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two spoke for more than an hour and a half, and both expressed hopes for repairing relations between the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was no agreement from the Russian president for Washington's proposed full 30-day ceasefire in Russia's war with its pro-Western neighbor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said Putin agreed to pause strikes on Ukraine energy targets for 30 days and that Putin had already given the order to his military. The White House said separately that the "leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire".
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has launched a series of devastating attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the three-year-old war. According to the Kremlin statement, Ukraine – which has bombed multiple Russian oil installations – had also agreed to the truce on energy targets, although Kyiv had yet to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders agreed that broader truce talks would "begin immediately in the Middle East," the White House said in its statement, also citing a "huge upside" if Russia and the United States improve their relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Kremlin statement said a "key condition" for peace would be ending Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military – a position that will alarm Kyiv and European capitals that have already accused Putin of stalling. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Despair mixed with anger in Kocani, North Macedonia on Tuesday in the wake of a horrific nightclub fire that left dozens dead and even more injured, prompting demands for justice.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the town of just 30,000 people, the deaths of 59 people – most of them teenagers and young adults – touched almost every home, with the agony of losing so many young people cutting especially deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are a small place. We all know each other," Sasko Jordanov, a 38-year-old dentist in Kocani, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am a doctor and have many patients dead, children of friends and neighbours."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have children – their friends died. This is horrible," said a woman as she lit candles at a makeshift shrine, where others left flowers and messages of condolence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire rapidly spread as a crowd of young fans packed into Club Pulse to attend the performance by a popular hip-hop band, DNK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze was apparently started by fireworks onstage igniting the ceiling of the nightclub.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 500 people were crammed inside despite just 250 tickets being sold, according to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of those killed were trampled as they rushed to the exits, while the roof was consumed with flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutor's office said the club had breached numerous fire regulations, including having insufficient extinguishers and emergency exits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Pance Toskovski said investigators had determined the club owner operated under a forged licence, and vowed to crackdown on corruption. (AFP)

    'Hamas chose war by refusing to release hostages'

<img alt="Palestinians flee their homes after the Israeli army issues evacuation orders. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796296_1_20250318213006.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States on Tuesday said that Hamas had chosen war by refusing to release hostages, as Israel unleashed its most intense strikes since a ceasefire, killing more than 400 people, and vowed to continue fighting until all hostages are returned.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement that "Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hughes' statement comes as Hamas leader Sami Abu Zuhri said that the Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip were an attempt to force the group's "surrender", and called the United States "complicit" in the escalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aim of the massacres committed by the occupation in Gaza is to undermine the ceasefire agreement and attempt to impose a surrender agreement, writing it in the blood of Gaza," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel's foreign minister Gideon Saar said that his country had "no alternative" other than to resume military operations in Gaza after efforts to secure the release of hostages failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saar's comments come as relatives of the Israeli hostages accused the country's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of sacrificing their loved ones by carrying out the strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  They called on supporters of the hostages to demonstrate outside Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem, warning that "military pressure could further endanger their lives and complicate efforts to bring them back safe and sound".
  <br>
  <br>
  Liran Berman is a brother of twin siblings who are being held hostage in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now my brothers are alive. My worst nightmare is to become a family of deceased and killed hostages. This is my worst nightmare right now," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the British government has called on Israel and Hamas to implement their ceasefire agreement for Gaza in full, and the EU has called for an immediate end to the renewed violence in the strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Moscow has said it deeply regrets Israel's resumption of military operation in Gaza. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least seven people were killed on Monday when a small plane crashed into the sea while taking off from the Honduras Caribbean island of Roatan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major Wilmer Guerrero of the country's fire department told reporters 10 people were retrieved from the site of the crash, six of whom were pronounced dead at the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  A crew member's body was then found floating in the sea near the plane, which crashed about a kilometre from the coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials gave conflicting reports on the number of people on board the plane -- either 17 or 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guerrero said one of the passengers, a 40-year-old French citizen, would be transferred to a hospital in the city of San Pedro Sula on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lanhsa airlines plane took off at nightfall from Roatan, one of the Bay Islands, and one of Honduras' main tourist destinations, heading for the port of La Ceiba, on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The plane almost fell on us. I was fishing," a fisherman told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honduran President Xiomara Castro said she had "immediately activated" an emergency committee made up of the armed forces, firefighters, and others to assist the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash was caused by an "apparent mechanical failure" on the British-made Jetstream 41, police said in a statement. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched new strikes against Hamas on Tuesday and promised "increasing military force" after talks on further hostage releases stalled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Ministry in Gaza said at least 200 people were killed and another 150 were wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he instructed the military to take "strong action" against Hamas in Gaza in response to the group's refusal to release hostages and rejection of all ceasefire proposals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength," the prime minister's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes come after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the 17-month long war where dozens of hostages were released for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior Hamas official accused Israel of unilaterally overturning the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Hamas said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin "Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Three houses were hit in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, a building in Gaza City, and targets in Khan Younis and Rafah, according to medics and witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab mediators, backed by the United States, haven't been able to hammer out differences between the two warring parties in talks held over the past two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Beijing on Tuesday called for steps to prevent a "humanitarian disaster" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is highly concerned about the current situation between Israel and Palestine," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said, calling for the parties to "avoid any actions that could lead to an escalation of the situation, and prevent a larger-scale humanitarian disaster". (Agencies)

 Irish mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor, who has been found liable of sexual assault, met Donald Trump during a Saint Patrick's Day visit on Monday during which he lashed out at illegal immigration in Ireland.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Ireland is at the cusp of potentially losing its Irishness," said McGregor during an appearance in the White House briefing room alongside the US president's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The illegal immigration racket is running ravage on the country," added the fighter, wearing a green business suit to mark Saint Patrick's Day, the centuries-old celebration of his homeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later hosted the 36-year-old former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) star - whom he said last week was his favourite Irishman - in the Oval Office.

  <br>
  McGregor posed for a picture with his arm around Trump's shoulder as the president sat at his desk, and for another with tech tycoon and powerful Trump advisor Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla billionaire Musk previously backed McGregor when he spoke in the past about a possible presidential bid in Ireland. Musk has recently spoken out in support of a number of anti-immigration parties in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Your work ethic is inspiring," McGregor told Trump, according to footage posted by an aide to the US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yours is too, you're fantastic," replied Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor had earlier said he would be "listening" to Trump on immigration - one of the US president's main focus areas as he seeks to ramp up deportations of people without proper documentation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We couldn't think of a better guest to have with us on Saint Patrick's Day," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor's comments earned swift pushback from Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, who met with Trump last week in the White House and received a dressing down over trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Conor McGregor's remarks are wrong, and do not reflect the spirit of St Patrick's Day, or the views of the people of Ireland," the premier posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a sport that combines various combat techniques, and can be extremely violent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been gaining popularity, particularly as Trump campaigned in 2024 with stars and promoters of the UFC series that is popular with many male voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicknamed "The Notorious," McGregor is one of the biggest stars in UFC, the most famous and lucrative MMA league. He is known for his aggressive, provocative temperament and noted for occasional anti-immigration outbursts.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November 2024 the fighter was ordered by an Irish court to pay damages to a woman who claimed that McGregor "brutally raped and battered" her in a hotel in Dublin in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor claimed they had consensual sex.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, the Irishman was sued in a US court in January, accused of sexual assault at an NBA game in Miami in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was meanwhile ordered by a New York jury in a civil trial in 2023 to pay US$5 million for sexually abusing and defaming writer E Jean Carroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump denied the allegations and appealed the verdict, which was upheld in December 2024. (AFP)

    Stranded astronauts set to return after nine months

<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than nine months aboard the International Space Station, a pair of astronauts are finally set to depart for Earth early Tuesday, ending a prolonged mission that has captivated global attention.
 <br>
  <br>
  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams flew to the orbital lab in June last year, on what was supposed to be a days-long roundtrip to test out Boeing's Starliner on its first crewed flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the spaceship developed propulsion problems and was deemed unfit to fly them back, instead returning empty without more major problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ex-Navy pilots Wilmore and Williams, 62 and 59 respectively, were instead re-assigned to the Nasa-SpaceX Crew-9 mission, which saw a Dragon spacecraft fly to the ISS last September with a team of two, rather than the usual four, to make room for the "stranded" pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, early Sunday, a relief team called Crew-10 docked with the station, their arrival met with broad smiles and hugs as they floated through the hatch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crew-10's arrival clears the way for Wilmore and Williams to depart, along with American Nick Hague and Russian astronaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.
  <br>
  <br>
  If all goes smoothly, the Dragon craft will deploy its parachutes off the coast of Florida for an ocean splashdown, where a recovery vessel will retrieve the crew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams' stay surpasses the standard six-month ISS rotation but ranks only sixth among US records for single-mission duration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Challenges such as muscle and bone loss, fluid shifts, and readjusting to gravity are well understood and well managed. (AFP)

    Indonesia to repatriate hundreds of scam workers

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 500 Indonesians freed from online scam centres in Myanmar are expected to be repatriated via Thailand in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cyberscam operations, which have thrived in Myanmar's lawless border areas for several years, lure foreign workers with promises of high-paying jobs but hold them hostage and force them to commit online fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 7,000 workers from at least two dozen countries have been freed in recent weeks, the majority of them Chinese, but many have been languishing in squalid temporary holding camps on the border between Myanmar and Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  400 Indonesian nationals will return home on Tuesday and around 160 are to come back on Wednesday, Judha Nugraha, the director of citizen protection at Indonesia's foreign ministry, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  They would come back on three flights from Bangkok after crossing into Thailand from Myanmar, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesian authorities already repatriated 140 nationals from Myanmar via Thailand last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in Myanmar, under pressure from ally China, have cracked down on the scam compounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Indonesians have been enticed abroad in recent years to other Southeast Asian countries for better-paying jobs, only to end up in the hands of transnational scam operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between 2020 and September last year, Jakarta repatriated more than 4,700 Indonesians entangled in online scam operations from countries including Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, according to foreign ministry data.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations estimates that as many as 120,000 people - many of them Chinese men - may be working in Myanmar scam centres against their will. (AFP)

    Kiribati eyes deep-sea mining deal with China

<img alt="View of Kiribati's Parliament House. Kiribati opened discussions with China after a deal with Canada's The Metals Company fell through. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796176_1_20250318084916.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pacific nation Kiribati says it is exploring a deep-sea mining partnership with China, dangling access to a vast patch of Pacific Ocean harbouring coveted metals and minerals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati opened discussions with Chinese ambassador Zhou Limin after a longstanding agreement with leading deep-sea mining outfit The Metals Company fell through.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talk provides an exciting opportunity to explore potential collaboration for the sustainable exploration of the deep-ocean resources in Kiribati," the government said on Monday evening in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pacific nations Kiribati, Cook Islands and Nauru sit at the forefront of a highly contentious push to mine the depths of the ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati holds rights for deep-sea mining exploration across a 75,000-square-kilometre swathe of the Pacific Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Through state-backed subsidiary Marawa Research, Kiribati had been working with Canada-based The Metals Company to develop the area's mineral deposits.
  <br>
  <br>
  That agreement was terminated "mutually" at the end of 2024, The Metals Company told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Metals Company said Kiribati's mining rights were "less commercially favourable than our other projects".
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm is racing to win regulatory approval that would make it one of the first companies to mine international waters on an industrial scale.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has partnerships with Kiribati's Pacific neighbours Nauru and Tonga.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the International Seabed Authority are currently meeting in Jamaica to thrash out the rules for deep-sea extraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Cook Islands struck a five-year agreement in February to cooperate in exploring the Pacific nation's seabed mineral riches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal did not include any exploration or mining licence. (AFP)

    Starbucks ordered to pay US$50m for hot tea spill

<img alt="A spokesperson for the coffee chain said the company would appeal the award. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796175_1_20250318083745.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Starbucks has been ordered to pay US$50 million to a customer who was burned when hot tea spilled on his lap at a California drive-through.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for Michael Garcia said the server who handed him three super-sized drinks in February 2020 did not push one of them into the cardboard cupholder properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  When he took the tray, the drink tipped over, "causing third degree burns to his penis, groin, and inner thighs," according to a statement from Trial Lawyers for Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a hospitalisation and multiple skin grafts, Michael has lived for five years with the disfigurement, pain, dysfunction, and psychological harm caused by the burns."
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which specialises in no-win-no-fee claims, said Starbucks had denied responsibility for Garcia's suffering, but before a jury trial had offered to settle for US$30 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the coffee giant balked at the demand for a public apology and a change in policy that Garcia wanted, so the case went to trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  A jury in Los Angeles on Friday awarded him US$50 million, a figure his attorneys said would eventually cost Starbucks more than US$60 million once pre-judgement interest, costs and attorneys' fees are added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starbucks Corporation consistently denied responsibility for five years, all the way up to and through trial, and attempted to escape responsibility," the lawyers' statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trial was a perfect example of frivolous defences and victim-blaming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proud of Michael for standing up for himself and having the courage to tell his story."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Starbucks said the company would appeal the award.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We sympathise with Mr Garcia, but we disagree with the jury's decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive," Jaci Anderson, director of corporate communications, said in a statement to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The case is redolent of a 1994 landmark legal action against McDonald's in New Mexico, when 79-year-old Stella Liebeck was awarded over US$2.8 million after spilling hot coffee on herself.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the award was reduced on appeal, the Liebeck case became a touchstone issue in US tort reform, and was often mocked as an example of how readily Americans resort to the law. (AFP)

    Carney says Canada must reduce reliance on US

<img alt="Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks during a bilateral meeting with Britain's Prime Minister. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796162_1_20250318063858.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Monday warned his country must reduce its reliance on the United States and would turn towards its "reliable" European allies instead on his first trip abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carney's transatlantic visit to British leader Keir Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron came after US President Donald Trump suggested his country could become part of the United States and threatened its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After succeeding Justin Trudeau last week, Carney conspicuously chose key European powers France and the United Kingdom, rather than the United States, for his first trip abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following talks with UK Prime Minister Starmer in London, Carney told journalists his country "must diversify" its trade and security ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What is clear is that our trade and our security relations are too reliant on the United States. We must diversify," the former Bank of England governor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's one of the reasons for which my first visit is to Paris and London."
  <br>
  <br>
  Underlining their "shared values" and "shared king", Starmer thanked Carney for his "approach to Ukraine", two days after the Canadian leader took part in a video conference on shoring up support for Kyiv hosted by his UK counterpart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's King Charles -- who is also head of state in Canada -- earlier welcomed Carney for talks at Buckingham Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's UK correspondent Gavin Grey said the king would have to play delicate balancing act between supporting Carney but also being cordial to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He [Trump] has described King Charles in very, very glowing terms... so the British are very keen to use that, they are very keen to get a trade deal with America, at least some form of a trade deal, and get that expedited," Grey explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the king at the same time wanted to make it absolutely clear, in the coded world in which the king has to live -- he can't take sides, he can't offer political advice out loud -- but he wanted to make it clear that he was very supportive of Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney had travelled to the British capital after meeting France's President Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing Canada as the "most European of non-European countries", Carney said his nation needed to boost ties with European allies like France while trying to retain positive relations with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney faces threats on three fronts: a trade war with Washington, Trump's threats to annex his country and looming elections at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's imposition of an escalating raft of import tariffs on Canadian goods has threatened to trigger a recession, and his scorn for Canadian sovereignty sent jitters through the former ally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opinion polls show a large majority of Canadian voters reject Trump's argument that their country would be better off as the "51st state of the United States".
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trade war is a threat to the economy of the vast country of 41 million people, which has long enjoyed a close US partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, France and Britain are among the Nato members that have maintained strong support for Ukraine's beleaguered government and military since Russia's all-out attack in February 2022, even as Trump's US administration has pushed Kyiv to make concessions to Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  London and Paris are putting together plans for a coalition security force in Ukraine and looking for allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada and France want a "solid and lasting peace, accompanied by robust guarantees that will protect Ukraine against any further Russian aggression," Macron said alongside Carney.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is in this spirit that we will... continue to demand clear commitments from Russia," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney told Macron, who also took part in Saturday's call hosted by Starmer on Ukraine, that both nations stood for "sovereignty".
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain is Canada's third-largest trading partner and France its eleventh at a time when Trump's tariffs and Canadian retaliatory measures are threatening trade with its huge southern neighbour -- destination of three-quarters of Canada's exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Canada also has a "Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement" with the European Union, which includes France.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, which now likewise includes Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first speech as prime minister, Carney said: "Security is a priority for this government... as is diversifying our trading and commercial relationships, of course, with both Europe and the United Kingdom."
  <br>
  <br>
  On his return leg, Carney will touch down in Iqaluit in Nunavut, the Canadian territory closest to the Danish autonomous country of Greenland -- another Trump target for annexation -- to "reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty". (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of people protested in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen on Monday, the Iran-backed rebels' Al-Masirah TV showed, two days after US attacks that left dozens dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators waved placards and assault rifles, chanting "Death to America, death to Israel", at a huge protest in the capital Sanaa, while rallies were also held in Saada, Dhamar, Hodeida and Amran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demonstrations were called by the rebel group's leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the capital, seized by the Houthis in 2014, giant Yemeni and Palestinian flags punctuated a sea of demonstrators at Al-Sabeen Square, the site of weekly protests throughout the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yemen will never back down -- we defy the Americans, we defy the Zionists," said a man shouting slogans to the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifty-three people died and 98 were wounded in Saturday's US attacks on Sanaa and other areas, according to the Houthi health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump ordered the attacks following months of Houthi attacks on the vital Red Sea maritime trade route, despite a pause since Gaza's ceasefire started in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In retaliation, the rebels claimed to have twice attacked a US aircraft carrier group within 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Huthis, part of Iran's "axis of resistance" against the US and Israel, launched scores of drone and missile attacks on passing ships and Israeli territory during the Gaza war, claiming solidarity with the Palestinians. (AFP)

 Belgium and Rwanda have announced the expulsion of each other's diplomats, as relations deteriorated over allegations about their respective roles in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kigali said it was severing diplomatic relations and giving Belgian diplomats 48 hours to leave the East African country, accusing Brussels of "using lies and manipulation to secure an unjustified hostile opinion of Rwanda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgium's foreign affairs minister Maxime Prevot said the move was "disproportionate and shows that when we disagree with Rwanda they prefer not to engage in dialogue." Brussels will reciprocate by declaring Rwandan diplomats persona non grata, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  African leaders have been trying to establish a lasting ceasefire in Congo, where the Rwandan government is accused of supporting an offensive by M23 rebels in eastern Congo. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Brands including Prada have cut ties with South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun amid controversy over his relationship with actress Kim Sae-ron, who was found dead in February.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old actor who gained popularity in South Korea and China over his role in hit drama series "My Love from the Star" and "Queen of Tears" has been accused of dating Kim Sae-ron when she was underage in a YouTube expose, citing testimonies from the actress' relatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luxury fashion group Prada said it mutually decided to end its collaboration with Kim when asked in a client service chat on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dinto, a South Korean cosmetic brand, also announced it was ending its advertising contract with Kim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have determined that there are substantial grounds rendering the fulfilment of the advertising contract unfeasible," the company said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Soo-hyun's agency Goldmedalist referred to a statement given on Friday, when it denied claims that the two were in a relationship dating back to 2015 when Kim Sae-ron was a minor. She was also managed by the agency, but her contract was not renewed in 2022; the same year that she was involved in a drunk driving incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldmedalist also said Kim Soo-hyun, who has not commented directly, had been unfairly linked to Kim Sae-ron's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim, who was 24 years old, was found dead at her home. Her career had suffered since the drunk driving incident, and local media reported that she was in debt and working part-time jobs to pay it off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldmedalist said the actress owed the company around 0.7 billion won, or HK$3.75 million, in damages and penalties as a result of the drunk driving case.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, Kim Sae-ron posted a photo of her with Kim Soo-hyun which was quickly deleted, prompting speculation that the two were a couple.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer representing the relatives of Kim Sae-ron said on Monday that the late actress had decided to post the photo in hopes of hearing back from Kim Soo-hyun. (Reuters)

    Mt Fuji entry fee set for hikers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hikers attempting any of Mount Fuji's four main trails will be charged an entry fee of 4,000 yen from this summer, after local authorities passed a bill on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A record influx of foreign tourists to Japan has sparked alarm about overcrowding on the nation's highest mountain, a once-peaceful pilgrimage site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, Yamanashi region, home to Mount Fuji, introduced a 2,000 yen entry fee plus an optional donation for the active volcano's most popular hiking route, the Yoshida Trail.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cap on daily entries and online reservations were also brought in on that trail by officials concerned about safety and environmental damage on Fuji's majestic slopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yoshida Trail fee will be doubled for this year's July-September climbing season, while neighbouring Shizuoka region passed a bill on Monday to also charge 4,000 yen for its three trails, which were previously free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks in part to the new restrictions, the number of climbers who tackled Mount Fuji declined to 204,316 last year, from 221,322 in 2023, environment ministry data shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although climber numbers continue to be eclipsed by pre-pandemic levels, "200,000 hikers is still huge," said Natsuko Sodeyama, a Shizuoka prefecture official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no other mountain in Japan that attracts that many people in the span of just over two months. So some restrictions are necessary to ensure their safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mount Fuji is covered in snow for most of the year, but during the summer hiking season many trudge up its steep, rocky slopes through the night to see the sunrise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symmetrical mountain has been immortalised in countless artworks, including Hokusai's "Great Wave". It last erupted around 300 years ago. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump says he plans to speak to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday about ending the war in Ukraine, adding discussions are already ongoing about "dividing up certain assets" between the warring parties.
 <br>
  <br>
  US officials had expressed optimism on Sunday that a Ukraine-Russia ceasefire deal could be reached in weeks after Washington proposed a halt in fighting in the three-year war after talks in Saudi Arabia, which Kyiv accepted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we'll be talking about land... we'll be talking about power plants," Trump said aboard Air Force One.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington and Kyiv's European allies are pressing Moscow to accept a halt in the fighting, but Putin has given no clear answer – instead listing a string of conditions and raising "serious questions" over the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's envoy for the conflict, Steve Witkoff, who met for several hours with Putin days ago, told CNN that he thinks "the two presidents are going to have a really good and positive discussion this week".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, he added, "really expects there to be some sort of deal in the coming weeks, maybe, and I believe that's the case".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday accused the Kremlin of not wanting to end the war. He warned that Moscow wanted to first "improve their situation on the battlefield" before agreeing to any ceasefire. (AFP)

    Philippines Senate to probe Duterte handover

<img alt="Imee Marcos is the one who set the wheels in motion for the senate probe.  Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796060_1_20250317151836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philippine Senate said on Monday it will conduct a formal probe of ex-president Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and swift handover last week to the International Criminal Court, which is to try him for alleged crimes against humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old, the first Asian former head of state charged by the ICC, stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups have said killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe was initiated by Senator Imee Marcos, sister of President Ferdinand Marcos but a close friend of Duterte's eldest daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two families have had a spectacular falling out since Marcos teamed with Duterte to win an election landslide in 2022. The latter has since been impeached on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As chairperson of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am calling for an urgent investigation into the arrest of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, an issue that has deeply divided the nation," Imee Marcos said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is imperative to establish whether due process was followed and to ensure that his legal rights were not just upheld but protected," she said, adding: "Our sovereignty and legal processes must remain paramount."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was arrested at Manila airport on March 11 after a brief trip to Hong Kong and flown to the Netherlands just hours later where he was turned over to the ICC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate has set a public hearing for Thursday and invited top police and other government officials to give evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imee Marcos has tracked a course largely independent from her brother on many issues, though she is running for re-election under the administration ticket for the May 12 midterm elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours after the arrest, she challenged the wisdom of the arrest of "poor president Duterte", warning that "this can only lead to trouble".
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, she declared: "I cannot accept what they did to [Duterte]." (AFP)

    Mass layoffs begin at Voice of America

<img alt="Contractual staff at Voice of America have been told they are terminated as of this end of this month. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796015_1_20250317104956.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration began mass layoffs at Voice of America and other US-funded media, making clear its intent to gut outlets long seen as critical for US influence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Just a day after all employees were put on leave, staff working on a contractual basis received an email notifying them that they were terminated at the end of this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractors were told that "you must cease all work immediately and are not permitted to access any agency buildings or systems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractors make up much of VOA's workforce and dominate staffing in the non-English language services, although recent figures were not immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many contractors are not US citizens, meaning they likely depend on their soon-to-disappear jobs for visas to stay in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Full-time VOA staff, who have more legal protections, were not immediately terminated but remain on administrative leave and have been told not to work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voice of America, created during World War II, broadcast around the world in 49 languages with a mission to reach countries deemed to be without media freedom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed an executive order on Friday targeting VOA's parent US Agency for Global Media in his latest sweeping cuts to the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency had 3,384 employees in the 2023 fiscal year. It had requested US$950 million for the current fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With VOA in limbo, some of its services have switched to playing music for lack of new programming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sweeping cuts also froze Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, formed in the Cold War to reach the former Soviet bloc, and Radio Free Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other US-funded outlets being gutted include Radio Farda, a Persian-language broadcaster blocked by Iran's government, and Alhurra, an Arabic-language network established after the Iraq invasion in the face of highly critical coverage by Qatar-based Al-Jazeera.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said on Saturday that "taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump regularly criticizes media coverage of him and has questioned the wisdom of funding VOA when it has a "firewall" ensuring its editorial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an editorial on the demise of VOA, China's Global Times tabloid said that "the monopoly of information held by some traditional Western media is being shattered."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multidimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughingstock of the times," it said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unusually vicious and damaging weather across multiple US states spawned violent tornadoes, blinding dust storms and fast-moving wildfires this weekend, leaving at least 37 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hailey Hart and her fiancé Steve Romero hunkered down with their three huskies inside their 1994 Toyota Celica as a tornado ripped apart their home Saturday in Tylertown, Mississippi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romero said he prayed out loud and hugged Hart as the car rolled onto its side, windows shattering, before it landed on its wheels again. After the twister passed, they could hear people nearby screaming for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was a bad dream come true,” Romero said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next door, Hart’s grandparents crawled out from the rubble of their destroyed house after they sought shelter in a bathroom as falling trees collapsed the roof.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Everything was coming down on us,” said Donna Blansett, Hart’s grandmother. “All I could do was pray to God to save us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  They escaped with just a few scratches and aches. Family members, friends and volunteers spent Sunday removing debris and salvaging anything they could find - some damp clothes, a photo album and a few toiletries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so happy you’re alive,” Hart said through tears, as she embraced her grandmother on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service said tornado watches had mostly expired, but dangerous winds were still possible in the Carolinas, east Georgia and northern Florida through Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dynamic storm that began Friday earned an unusual “high risk” designation from weather forecasters. Still, experts said it was not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least three people, including an 82-year-old woman, were killed in central Alabama when multiple tornadoes swept across the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Troy, Alabama, parks officials said the recreation centre where many residents had taken refuge had to be closed due to damage from overnight storms. No one was injured.
  <br>

   <br>
   Missouri resident Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing trapped neighbours found five bodies scattered in rubble on Friday night outside what remained of his aunt’s house in hard-hit Wayne County. Scattered twisters killed at least a dozen people in the state, authorities said.

    In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reeves announced that six people died and more than 200 were displaced after tornadoes sowed devastation across three counties. And in the northern part of the state, roads were inundated and some people were stranded by flood waters.

    <br>
    Wind-driven wildfires caused extensive damage in Texas and Oklahoma and officials warned on Sunday that parts of both states would again face an increased risk of fire danger in the coming week.
    <br>
    <br>
    More than 130 fires were reported across Oklahoma and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed, Governor Kevin Stitt said.
    <br>
    <br>
    Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management spokesperson Keli Cain said two people were killed as a result of wildfires and weather.
    <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, dust storms spurred by high winds claimed almost a dozen lives on Friday.
    <br>
    <br>
    Eight people died in a Kansas highway pileup involving at least 50 vehicles, according to the state highway patrol. Authorities said three people also were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle. (AP)

 A pair of US astronauts stuck for more than nine months on the International Space Station will be returned to Earth on Tuesday evening, Nasa said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are to be transported home with another American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, which arrived at the ISS early on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stranded duo have been on the ISS since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa said in a statement on Sunday evening that it had moved forward the astronauts' anticipated ocean splashdown off the Florida coast to Tuesday evening. It was initially slated for no sooner than Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favourable weather conditions expected for later in the week," the space agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos astronaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will also return on the Dragon capsule, with the journey to be broadcast live from Monday evening when hatch closure preparations begin.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Wilmore and Williams, it will mark the end of an ordeal that has seen them stuck for nine months after what was meant to have been a days-long roundtrip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their prolonged stay was significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russia's Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station. (AFP)

    UK finance minister to unveil plan to cut red tape

<img alt="Regulators will be summoned to Downing Street to hear Rachel Reeves' action plan to cut the administrative cost of regulation on business. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795990_1_20250317085014.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's Labour government will on Monday set out details of how it plans to slash red tape to boost business, as it struggles to deliver growth nine months after winning power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chancellor Rachel Reeves' shake-up comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer took aim at the nation's "flabby state", sparking anger from unions who called on him to avoid the "incendiary rhetoric" of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance ministry said regulators would be summoned to the prime minister's Downing Street office on Monday to hear Reeves announce her "action plan to deliver on the pledge to cut the administrative cost of regulation on business by a quarter".
  <br>
  <br>
  The "radical" plan would cut "costly red tape" such as the "hundreds of pages of guidance on protecting bat habitats which goes far beyond legal requirements", said a statement, referring to the £100 million (US$130 million) spent on a bat tunnel by the company building Britain's new high-speed HS2 train line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel has become a lightning rod for criticism of the planning system, with the Prime Minister describing it as "absurd".
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of regulators will also be cut under Reeves' plan, saving businesses "billions of pounds", the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer on Thursday announced that he was axing NHS England which has run the state-run National Health Service in that nation since 2012, in a move seen as a dramatic shift to the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has dubbed NHS England "the world's largest quango" (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation).
  <br>
  <br>
  Its abolition was the "beginning not the end" and more health-related quangos would also face the chop, Health Secretary Wes Streeting wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour ousted former prime minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative government in a landslide election victory last July but has seen its popularity ratings fall during a bumpy start.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is under pressure to deliver on its election promise to kickstart economic growth while keeping prices under control amid a prolonged cost of living crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The central bank in February slashed its forecast for UK economic growth and warned that inflation would rise more than expected this year, blaming global risks amid US tariff threats and deteriorating business confidence in the UK. (AFP)

    Hospitalised Pope Francis addresses frailty

<img alt="Children holding balloons gather by the statue of John Paul II outside the Gemelli University Hospital where Pope Francis is hospitalised, in Rome. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795960_1_20250316215620.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis acknowledged being fragile and "facing a period of trial", as he thanked well-wishers on Sunday for prayers in a message from hospital, where he has been slowly recovering from pneumonia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pope, who has weathered his setbacks along with periods of improvement since being hospitalised on February 14, sent a particularly personal message to the faithful that referenced both his faith and his frailty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am sharing these thoughts with you while I am facing a period of trial, and I join with so many brothers and sisters who are sick: fragile, at this time, like me," wrote the pope in the message published by the Vatican.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our bodies are weak but, even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope," he added in the message marking the second Sunday of Lent, a 40-day period of prayer and reflection leading up to Easter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday was the fifth time in a row the pope's illness had prevented him from personally giving the Angelus prayer, usually delivered to a crowd gathered in St Peter's Square following mass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Francis has yet to appear at the window of his papal suite on the 10th floor of the Gemelli hospital, that has not dissuaded a steady stream of well-wishers from gathering.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, dozens of children including scouts from a Catholic group stood at the foot of a statue of Pope John Paul II at the hospital's entrance, holding yellow and white balloons and vainly striving to catch a glimpse of the pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You see the pope there!" shouted one of them eagerly, before being set straight by the group leader, Valerio Santobonio, 23: "I don't think that's him."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday we had some drawings made specifically to give to the Holy Father," Santobonio told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the boys and girls, aged from five to seven, don't quite yet grasp who the pope is, nor his health situation, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite not appearing at the window to wave, Francis addressed his youngest well-wishers in his message.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to 'Gemelli' as a sign of closeness," Francis wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you, dearest children! The pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week the Vatican signalled that the Argentine Jesuit was out of danger after a series of breathing crises earlier in his hospitalisation had sparked fears for his life.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the Vatican said Francis's condition continued to be stable and showing progress, as it has for the past week, but cautioned he still needed therapies administered within the hospital setting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Holy Father still requires hospital medical therapy, motor and respiratory physiotherapy; these therapies, at present, are showing further, gradual improvements," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That message appeared to quash speculation that the pope's progress could signal an imminent release from hospital. (AFP)

    'Most scared I've been': US strikes sow panic in Yemen

<div class="itemFullText">
 The first US strikes against Yemen's Houthis since Donald Trump took office killed 31 people, the rebels said on Sunday, with the US president warning "hell will rain down upon" the Iran-backed group if it did not stop attacking shipping.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis, who have attacked Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, said children were among those killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attacks on Sanaa, as well as on areas in Saada, Al-Bayda and Radaa, killed at least 31 people and wounded 101, "most of whom were children and women", Houthi health ministry spokesperson Anis Al-Asbahi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage on Houthi media showed children and a woman among those being treated in a hospital emergency room, including a dazed girl with blackened legs wrapped in bandages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in a post on social media, vowed to "use overwhelming lethal force" to end the Houthi attacks, which the rebels say are in solidarity with Palestinians amid the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  After halting their attacks when a ceasefire took effect in Gaza in January, the Houthis announced on Tuesday that they would resume them until Israel lifted its blockade of aid to the devastated Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late on Saturday, a plume of white smoke had risen over Sanaa after explosions rocked the northern district of the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Houthis sealed off areas around the blast sites, making it impossible to gauge the true scale of the destruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohammad Albasha, a US-based consultant, said the area targeted in Sanaa was home to senior Houthi leaders and considered their stronghold in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the point of no return, and from now on, it's gloves off between the Houthis and CENTCOM," he said, referring to the regional US military command.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amal, 29, who lives with her mother in Sanaa, said Saturday's attacks were "terrifying... windows were shattered and the walls of the house shook".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Several military operations against the Houthis have been announced, but they've only added more casualties, most of them civilians."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The homes and locations of the leaders are well-known, but the victims are always civilians." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire that tore through a nightclub in North Macedonia killed 59 revellers attending a hip-hop concert at the venue, with more than 100 wounded, the country's interior minister said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out in "Pulse", a nightclub in the eastern town of Kocani, where more than 1,000 mostly young fans had crammed in to see the hip-hop duo DNK popular in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to the data we have by now, 59 persons lost their lives," interior minister Pance Toskovski said after visiting the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 100 persons are injured," Toskovski said, adding that the wounded had been transported to the local hospital in the town as well as to the capital Skopje and the town of Stip some 30 kilometres to the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  The concert kicked off around midnight, while online media outlet SDK, reported that the fire started about three hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Toskovski, the fire was probably caused by the use of pyrotechnic devices "used for light effect at the concert".
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment of activating the so-called sprinklers, the sparks caught the ceiling that was made of easily flammable material after which for a very short period of time the fire spread across the whole discotheque, creating a thick smoke" Toskovski said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Helicopters ferried some of the wounded to the capital Skope's hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted on social networks and shot before the fire show the use of stage jets, a type of indoor fireworks used during concerts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other videos published by media in the Balkan country show the entrance to the building blackened by flames.

 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke on Saturday to discuss the next stage in talks on ending Moscow's war against Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, the top diplomats "agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement gave no details on when the next round of US-Russia talks, which are being hosted by Saudi Arabia, would begin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also updated Lavrov on military activity in the Middle East, where US forces carried out deadly strikes on Saturday against Huthi rebel targets in Yemen, the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite recent tensions between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, Kyiv has agreed in principle to a US-brokered 30-day unconditional ceasefire if Moscow halts its attacks in eastern Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's President Vladimir Putin has not however agreed to any truce, instead setting conditions that were beyond what was called for in the US agreement with Ukraine. (AFP)

    US launches large-scale strikes against Yemeni Houthis

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 19 were killed as US President Donald Trump launched large-scale military strikes against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis on Saturday over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping, warning "hell will rain down" on them if they do not stop.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump also warned Iran, the Houthis' main backer, that it needed to immediately halt support for the group. He said if Iran threatened the United States, "America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The unfolding strikes - which one official said would last days and maybe weeks - represent the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since Trump took office in January. It came as the United States ramps up sanctions pressure on Tehran while trying to bring it to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 13 civilians were killed and nine injured in US strikes on Yemen's capital Sanaa, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six others, including four children and one woman, were killed and 11 were injured in a US strike on the northern province of Saada, the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis' political bureau described the attacks as a "war crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to respond to escalation with escalation," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents in Sanaa said the strikes hit a building in a Houthi stronghold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The explosions were violent and shook the neighbourhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children," one of the residents, who gave his name as Abdullah Yahia, told Reuters.

  <br>
  The Houthis, an armed movement that took control of most of Yemen over the past decade, have launched more than 100 attacks targeting shipping since November 2023, disrupting global commerce and setting the US military on a costly campaign to intercept missiles and drones that burned through stocks of US air defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis say the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's other allies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, have been severely weakened by Israel since the start of the Gaza conflict. Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who was closely aligned with Tehran, was overthrown by rebels in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  But throughout, Yemen's Houthis have remained resilient and often on the offensive, sinking two vessels, seizing another and killing at least four seafarers in an offensive that disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US administration of former President Joe Biden had sought to degrade the Houthis' ability to attack vessels off its coast but limited the U.S. actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Trump has authorised a more aggressive approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes on Saturday were carried out in part by fighter aircraft from the Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, which is in the Red Sea, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US military's Central Command, which oversees troops in the Middle East, described Saturday's strikes as the start of a large-scale operation across Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Houthi attacks on American ships & aircraft (and our troops!) will not be tolerated; and Iran, their benefactor, is on notice," Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. "Freedom of Navigation will be restored."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump held out the prospect of far more devastating military action against Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective," Trump wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump’s proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,” he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. “A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,” Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 , a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said nine people, including journalists, were killed in Israeli strikes in the north on Saturday, an attack Hamas denounced as a "blatant violation" of the fragile ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Nine martyrs have been transferred (to hospital), including several journalists and a number of workers from the Al-Khair Charitable Organisation, as a result of the occupation targeting a vehicle with a drone in the town of Beit Lahia, coinciding with artillery shelling on the same area," said civil defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory reported that "nine martyrs and several injured, including critical cases, have arrived at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza Strip, due to the ongoing Israeli aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Israeli military said it struck "two terrorists... operating a drone that posed a threat to IDF troops in the area of Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Later, a number of additional terrorists collected the drone operating equipment and entered a vehicle. The IDF struck the terrorists," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the strikes, Hamas accused Israel of violating the Gaza truce deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The occupation (Israel) has committed a horrific massacre in the northern Gaza Strip by targeting a group of journalists and humanitarian workers, in a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of Hamas-affiliated media in Gaza, Ismail Thawabteh, said that local photo journalists were killed while "using a drone to capture images of a Ramadan dining table in Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they were "directly targeted by the occupation in two air strikes, despite their work being clear."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has carried out near-daily air strikes in Gaza since early March, often targeting what the military said were militants planting explosive devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce in Israel's war with Hamas, in effect since January 19, has largely held despite the attacks and with no agreement yet on extending the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the truce ended on March 1, but both Israel and Hamas have refrained from returning to all-out war. (AFP)

<img alt="Volodymyr Zelensky says he wants European boots on the ground in Ukraine. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795883_1_20250315215053.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he had urged Kyiv's Western allies to give "a clear position" on security guarantees, including about a potential foreign troop contingent on Ukrainian soil with a US backstop.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer held a virtual call with other European leaders and allies, including Zelensky, where Starmer said a "coalition of the willing" would help secure Ukraine "on the land, at sea and in the sky" in the event of a peace deal with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to continue working on the contingents that will form the foundation of Europe's future Armed Forces," Zelensky said in a post on X with an image of himself taking part in the call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Peace will be more reliable with European contingents on the ground and the American side as a backstop."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has also called for a US security backstop to help secure a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine in the three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian leader Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he supported in principle US President Donald Trump's proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine, but that Russia would fight on until several crucial conditions were worked out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky urged European leaders to dismiss Putin's opposition to European peacekeepers in Ukraine and blamed the Russian leader for stalling peace efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A ceasefire could have already happened, but Russia is doing everything to prevent it," he said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Russian captain of a cargo ship which struck a tanker in the North Sea off the UK's northeastern coast appeared in court on Saturday charged with gross negligence manslaughter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vladimir Motin, 59, appeared before magistrates in the port of Hull, where he was remanded in custody. He did not enter a plea, and will next appear in the Old Bailey in London on April 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, was arrested on Monday after his ship, the Portuguese-flagged Solong, rammed into the fuel-laden tanker Stena Immaculate, setting both vessels ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Humberside Police said earlier that "extensive searches" by HM Coastguard to locate a missing crew member from the Solong had failed to locate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crew member was identified by state prosecutors as Mark Angelo Pernia, a 38-year-old Filipino, who is now presumed dead, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-flagged tanker, which had been chartered by the US military, was anchored off the coast of Hull in northeastern England at the time of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were granted two extensions on Wednesday and Thursday to allow more time to question the captain, given "the complexities of the incident," the Humberside police force said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  An investigation led by the UK, with US and Portuguese teams, has been launched to determine the exact cause of the collision, and why the Solong did not deviate from its course before it ploughed into the tanker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK government has ruled out foul play so far. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK premier Keir Starmer said on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would "sooner or later" have to "come to the table" as he opened a virtual summit to drum up support for a coalition willing to protect any eventual ceasefire in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British prime minister told some 25 fellow leaders as they joined a virtual call hosted by Downing Street that they should focus on how to strengthen Ukraine, protect any ceasefire and keep up the pressure on Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Ukraine had shown it was the "party of peace" by agreeing to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, "Putin is the one trying to delay," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Putin is serious about peace, I think it's very simple, he has to stop his barbaric attacks on Ukraine and agree to a ceasefire, and the world is watching," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight fighting continued in the relentless three-year war, with Russia saying it had taken two more villages in its Kursk border region where it has launched an offensive to wrest back seized territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  As moves have gathered pace for a ceasefire, Moscow has pushed this week to retake a large part of the land that Ukraine originally captured in western Kursk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian defence ministry said troops took control over the villages of Zaoleshenka and Rubanshchina – north and west of the town of Sudzha, the main town that Moscow reclaimed this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv, meanwhile, said its air force had overnight downed 130 Iranian-made Russian-launched Shahed drones over 14 regions of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin has called on embattled Ukrainian troops in Kursk to "surrender," while his US counterpart Donald Trump urged the Kremlin to spare their lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't allow President Putin to play games with President Trump's deal," Starmer said in comments released by Downing Street late on Friday, ahead of Saturday's call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Kremlin's complete disregard for President Trump's ceasefire proposal only serves to demonstrate that Putin is not serious about peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have been leading efforts to assemble a so-called "coalition of the willing" ever since Trump opened direct negotiations with Moscow last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  They say the group is necessary – along with US support – to provide Ukraine with security guarantees by deterring Putin from violating any ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was on Saturday's call, said on Friday he had discussed "technical aspects" of how the ceasefire could be implemented with Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our teams continue to work on clear security guarantees, and they will be ready soon," Zelensky said on the social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and Macron have said they are willing to put British and French troops on the ground in Ukraine, but it is not clear if other countries are keen on doing the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called on Russia late on Friday to accept the proposal for a ceasefire and stop making statements aimed at "delaying the process."
  <br>
  <br>
  The French president also demanded that Moscow stop its "acts of violence" in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany on Friday likewise criticised Putin's response to the US-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine as "at best a delaying tactic."
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday he was "cautiously optimistic" about reaching a truce, but acknowledged there was "a lot of work that remains to be done."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has said he welcomes any offer of support for the coalition, raising the prospect that some countries could contribute logistics or surveillance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The call is expected to delve further into how countries plan to contribute to the coalition of the willing, ahead of a military planning session being held next week," the UK government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Starmer will say that countries "need to ratchet up economic pressure on Russia, to force Putin into negotiations, in the short term."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And be prepared to support a just and enduring peace in Ukraine over the long term and continue to ramp up our military support to Ukraine to defend themselves against increasing Russian attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  British Commonwealth partners Canada, Australia and New Zealand have been involved in early talks and are due to dial in to the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nato chief Mark Rutte and European Union chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa are also expected to take part, along with the leaders of Germany, Spain, Portugal, Latvia, Romania, Turkey and the Czech Republic, among others. (AFP)

    Cuba suffers fourth nationwide blackout in five months

<img alt="People gather in a neighbourhood during a national electrical grid collapse in Havana, Cuba. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795833_1_20250315115602.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cuba suffered a general blackout on Friday caused by a crash of its national electricity grid, officials said, the fourth major power outage on the cash-strapped communist island in five months.
 <br>
  <br>
  "At around 8:15 pm tonight, a breakdown... caused the significant loss of power in western Cuba and with it the fall of the national electricity system," the Ministry of Energy and Mines said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on the social network X, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz said the government was "working tirelessly" to restore power.
  <br>
  <br>
  In by now familiar scenes, the streets of Havana were plunged into darkness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a few hotels and private businesses with generators still had lights on, as did essential services such as hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Angelica Caridad Martinez, a resident of the central city of Camaguey, said she was about to sit down for dinner when the power failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not even hungry anymore," the 50-year-old said, "This situation is unsustainable, no one can live like this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The island of 9.7 million inhabitants has suffered three nationwide blackouts in the final months of 2024, two of them lasting several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The repeated outages comes as the island battles its worst economic crisis in 30 years, marked by widespread shortages of food, medicine and fuel, high inflation and a massive outflow of migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday night marked the first general blackout of 2025, but citizens face almost daily outages of four or five hours across much of Havana, while in rural provinces the periods without power can last 20 hours or longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cuba's eight thermal power plants, nearly all of which came online in the 1980s or 1990s, suffer routine failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Turkish floating power barges that help boost Cuba's national grid are fed with expensive imported fuel which is often in short supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cuba's leadership points to a six-decade-long US trade embargo that intensified during Donald Trump's first presidency for its difficulties in keeping the lights on.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make up its electricity shortfall, Cuba is racing to install a series of at least 55 solar farms with Chinese technology by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to authorities, these facilities will generate some 1,200 megawatts of power, about 12 percent of the national total. (AFP)

 After more than nine months on the International Space Station, two astronauts are a step closer to returning home following the launch of a crew swap mission on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Falcon 9 rocket with a Crew Dragon fixed to its top blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carrying a four-member team bound for the orbital outpost.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We celebrate the countless individuals all over the world that have made this journey possible," said astronaut Nichole Ayers, the designated pilot of the Crew-10 mission, just before launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the real focus is what their arrival enables - the long-overdue departure from the ISS of NASA duo Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two former US Navy pilots have been stuck aboard the orbital lab since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Starliner returned empty, without experiencing further major issues and what was meant to have been a days-long round-trip for Wilmore and Williams has now stretched past nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by NASA astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station.
  <br>
  <br>
  What began as a technical failure has also spiraled into a political flashpoint, as President Donald Trump and his close advisor, Elon Musk, who leads SpaceX, have repeatedly suggested that former president Joe Biden "abandoned" the pair intentionally and rejected a plan to bring them back sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, has drawn attention for his bizarre remarks about the situation, referring to Williams, a decorated former naval captain, as "the woman with the wild hair" and speculating about the personal dynamic between the two.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've been left up there. I hope they like each other, maybe they love each other, I don't know," he said during a recent White House press conference. (AFP)

    Putin tells Ukraine troops in Kursk to 'surrender'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on beleaguered Ukrainian troops in the Russian region of Kursk to "surrender" as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Russian leader of seeking to sabotage a ceasefire initiative.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump urged Putin to spare the lives of the Ukrainian troops as he said his envoy had held "productive" talks with Russia's leader on a proposed 30-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has mounted a rapid counteroffensive in the western border region of Kursk over the past week, recapturing much of the territory Ukraine seized in a shock incursion last August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat in Kursk would be a major blow to Ukraine's plans to use its hold on the region as a bargaining chip in peace talks for the three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are sympathetic to President Trump's call," Putin said in remarks broadcast on Russian television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment," Putin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said "thousands" of Ukrainian troops were "completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's military leadership denied the claims. "There is no threat of our units being encircled," Ukraine's General Staff posted on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky gave a more sober assessment in comments to reporters in Kyiv. "The situation in the Kursk region is obviously very difficult," he said, while insisting the campaign still had value.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's latest comments came as he gave an update on a meeting on Thursday between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin on a US-Ukrainian proposal for a 30-day pause in hostilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said on Thursday that he had "serious questions" about the proposal and that events in Kursk would influence the next moves towards a ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said on Friday that it was "cautiously optimistic" a deal could be reached, but that Trump and Putin had to speak directly before talks could progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin, addressing his Security Council, said he had read Trump's appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  While accusing Ukrainian troops of carrying out crimes against civilians that he said amounted to "terrorism", something Kyiv denies, Putin said he understood the call by Trump to take humanitarian considerations into account. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Carney was formally sworn in as prime minister of Canada on Friday, putting him in a position to fight tariffs from US President Donald Trump that could devastate the trade-dependent Canadian economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the presence of Governor General Mary Simon, the personal representative of King Charles, who is Canada's head of state, Carney took the oath of office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moment capped a momentous rise for the 59-year-old, who became the first Canadian prime minister without any serious political experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney plans to travel to London and Paris next week, said a diplomat aware of the plans. Canada has sought to shore up alliances in Europe as its relations with the United States sink to unprecedented lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney has reshaped his cabinet with a view to dealing with Washington. Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc is moving to the international trade portfolio and will be replaced by current Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney crushed his rivals on Sunday in a race to become leader of the ruling Liberal Party. He replaces Justin Trudeau, who spent more than nine years in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former head of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, successfully argued his position as an outsider with a history of tackling crises meant he was the best person to take on Trump, who has repeatedly talked about annexing Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Carney told reporters that he was ready to meet Trump when "there is respect for Canadian sovereignty."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he would keep in place retaliatory tariffs on US goods until the United States showed Canada some respect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts are underway to arrange a call between Trump and Carney in the next couple of days, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters on Friday. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte failed to show in person at the International Criminal Court on Friday at the opening of his crimes against humanity hearing over his deadly crackdown on narcotics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old, the first ex-Asian head of state to face charges at the ICC, was following by video link during a short hearing to inform him of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sounding frail and wearing a blue suit and tie, he spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth. The presiding judge allowed him to follow proceedings in absentia due to his long flight to The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the prosecutor's application for his arrest, he said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in the Philippines."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims' families have welcomed the trial as a chance to get justice, while Duterte supporters believe he was "kidnapped" and sent to The Hague amid a spectacular fallout with the ruling Marcos family. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police on Friday again extended the detention of the captain of a cargo ship that struck a tanker in the North Sea, citing the "complexities" of the case.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Russian captain was arrested on Monday on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter after his ship, the Solong, slammed into the tanker anchored off the coast of Hull in northeastern England, setting both ships ablaze and leaving one sailor presumed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were granted two extensions on Wednesday and Thursday to allow more time to question the 59-year-old captain due to "the complexities of the incident," the local Humberside police force said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police cited the location of both vessels at sea as one of the complications facing the probe, with the ships on fire for several days after the incident, requiring a massive firefighting response.
  <br>
  <br>
  While all crew onboard the jet fuel-laden tanker, the US-flagged Stena Immaculate, were safely rescued, one sailor from the Portuguese-flagged Solong remains missing and presumed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the government has ruled out foul play, investigators are still determining the causes of the crash, in which the Solong never deviated from its course and slammed into the Stena at 16 knots an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pockets of fire were still being reported on the deck of the Solong on Thursday evening, according to the UK Coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Extensive lines of enquiry are continuing," police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salvage teams boarded the vessels on Thursday to carry out initial damage assessments. (AFP)

    Lunar eclipse brings 'bloody' marvellous spectacle

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stargazers across a swathe of the world marvelled at a dramatic red "Blood Moon" during a rare total lunar eclipse in the early hours of Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The celestial spectacle was visible in the Americas and Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as well as in the westernmost parts of Europe and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The phenomenon happens when the sun, earth and moon line up, causing our planet to cast a giant shadow across its satellite.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the earth's shadow crept across the moon, it did not entirely blot out its white glow. Instead the moon glowed a reddish colour.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because the only sunlight that reaches the moon is "bent and scattered" as it goes through earth's atmosphere, said Daniel Brown, an astronomer at Britain's Nottingham Trent University.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is similar to how the light can become pink or red during sunrises or sunsets on earth, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The more clouds and dust there are in earth's atmosphere, the redder the moon appears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown called the lunar eclipse, which will last around six hours, "an amazing way to see the solar system in action."
  <br>
  <br>
  The period when the moon is completely in earth's shadow, called the totality, lasts just over an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  This event has been dubbed the "Blood Worm Moon," after one of the names given to March full moons by some Native Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first total lunar eclipse since 2022, but there will be another one in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's event is a "Micromoon," meaning the moon is the farthest away it gets from earth, making it appear about seven percent smaller than normal, according to the website Earthsky.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the opposite of a "Supermoon," as was seen during 2022's lunar eclipse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some stargazers will be in for another treat later this month. That will be a partial solar eclipse. (AFP)

    US Senate in race to avert government shutdown

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate finds itself on Friday in a familiar position, working to avoid a partial government shutdown with just hours to spare as Democrats confront two painful options: allowing passage of a bill they believe gives President Donald Trump vast discretion on spending decisions or voting no and letting a funding lapse ensue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer gave members of his caucus days to vent their frustration about the options before them, but late on Thursday made clear he will not allow a shutdown. His move gives Democrats room to side with Republicans and allow the continuing resolution, often described as a CR, to come up for a vote as soon as Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A procedural vote on Friday will provide a first test of whether the package has the 60 votes needed to advance, ahead of final voting likely later in the day. At least eight Democrats will need to join with Republicans to move the funding package forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  “While the CR still is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,” Schumer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congress has been unable to pass the annual appropriations bills designed to fund the government, so they've resorted to passing short-term extensions instead. The legislation before the Senate marks the third such continuing resolution for the current fiscal year, now nearly half over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legislation would fund the federal government through the end of September. It would trim non-defense spending by about US$13 billion from the previous year and increase defense spending by about US$6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly US$1.7 trillion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican-led House passed the spending bill on Tuesday and then adjourned. The move left senators with a decision to either take it or leave it. And while Democrats have been pushing for a vote on a fourth short-term extension, GOP leadership made clear that option was a non-starter. (AP)

    China hosts trilateral nuclear talks with Iran, Russia

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged an end to "illegal" sanctions on Iran as it hosted diplomats from that country and Russia on Friday for talks Beijing hopes will restart long-stalled negotiations on Tehran's nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi held their meeting in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A readout of the talks by CCTV said the three diplomats "exchanged views on the Iran nuclear issue and other issues of common concern".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma expressed China's support for "political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue based on mutual respect" after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We emphasised the necessity of ending all illegal, unilateral sanctions," Ma told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The relevant parties should work to eliminate the root causes of the current situation and abandon sanctions, pressure, and threats of the use of force."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement, the three countries reaffirmed that political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue remains the only viable and practical option for the Iranian nuclear issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which had imposed curbs on Tehran's nuclear development in return for sanctions relief, during US President Donald Trump's first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the agreement for a year after Washington's withdrawal but then began rolling back its commitments. Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered.

  Trump recently sent a letter to Tehran urging nuclear talks, warning of possible military action if it refuses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded that he would not negotiate with the US while being "threatened", and Iran would not bow to US "orders" to talk.

  Iran has long denied that it is working on developing a nuclear weapon. But the International Atomic Energy Agency warned last month that Tehran was "dramatically" accelerating enrichment of uranium to near the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level. (AFP/Reuters)

 An American Airlines plane caught fire after landing at Denver International Airport, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flight 1006, which was headed from Colorado Springs to Dallas, diverted to Denver and landed safely around 5.15pm on Thursday after the crew reported engine vibrations, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While taxiing to the gate, an engine on the Boeing 737-800 caught fire, the FAA added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers stood on one of the plane’s wings as smoke surrounded the aircraft. The FAA said passengers exited using the slides.
  <br>
  <br>
  American said the flight experienced an engine-related issue after taxiing to the gate. There was no immediate clarification on exactly when the plane caught fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 172 passengers and six crew members were taken to the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twelve people were transported to hospitals with minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We thank our crew members, DEN team and first responders for their quick and decisive action with the safety of everyone on board and on the ground as the priority,” American said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters put out the blaze by  evening, an airport spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said it will investigate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country has seen a recent spate of aviation disasters and close calls stoking fears about air travel, though flying remains a very safe mode of transport. (AP)

    Japanese duo pay for Great Wall buttocks 'prank'

<img alt="The two Japanese were caught soon after their stunt at the Great Wall. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795690_1_20250314111711.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Japanese tourists in their 20s were detained for two weeks in China then deported for taking photos showing exposed buttocks at the Great Wall, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident at the World Heritage site near Beijing concerned a man who showed his bottom and a woman who took photos, NTV and other Japanese media outlets reported on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's foreign ministry said on Friday that "the embassy of Japan in China confirmed on January 3 that two Japanese nationals were detained by local authorities at the Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  They "were subsequently released and returned to Japan during January", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese embassy did not reply to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists were detained on the spot by security guards and held for around two weeks, the reports said, citing sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exposing the lower half of the body in a public place is against the law in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists reportedly told the embassy they did it as a prank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reports sparked outrage in China, where memories of atrocities committed during Japan's occupation of the country in the 1930s and 40s still evoke strong feelings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hashtag translating to "Japanese man and woman detained for indecent behaviour at the Great Wall" had been viewed more than 60 million times on Weibo by Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many top-liked comments blasted the tourists for the act, with some using hateful language toward Japanese people.
  <br>
  <br>
  One comment by actor Chen Yitian, who has over seven million followers on the platform, condemned them for doing "shameful things on my Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others suggested China ban all Japanese visitors. (AFP)

    US influencer visa under review after wombat outcry

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia is reviewing an American influencer’s visa after she posted video of her snatching a baby wombat from its mother.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sam Jones, who describes herself as an “outdoor enthusiast & hunter,” made her Instagram account private on Thursday after she was widely condemned for the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  It shows her lifting the wombat joey by its front legs in darkness from a roadside and running away from its mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I caught a baby wombat,” she says, as a man filming her laughs. She returns the wombat to the roadside after several seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said her visa was under review.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The department is now working through the conditions on her current visa and determining whether immigration law has been breached,” Burke said in a statement on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I can’t wait for Australia to see the back of this individual, I don’t expect she will return,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added his voice to the criticism. “To take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage,” Albanese told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there. Take another animal that can actually fight back rather than stealing a baby wombat from its mother,” Albanese added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones, who also uses the name Samantha Strable, closed her social media channels to messages and couldn’t be reached for comment on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wombat appears to be a common wombat, also known as a bare-nosed wombat. It is a protected marsupial found only in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yolandi Vermaak, founder of the animal care charity Wombat Rescue, said separating the young wombat from its mother created a risk that the mother would reject her offspring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My biggest concern is that we didn’t actually see mom and baby getting reunited. When she put it down, it looked disoriented. It was turned away from where the mother was last seen. So we don’t know if mom and baby actually found each other again,” Vermaak told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. (AP)

    Johns Hopkins University to cut thousands of jobs

<img alt="President Trump signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to allow time to assess overseas expenses. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795666_1_20250314084123.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The prestigious Johns Hopkins University said on Thursday it was being forced to lay off more than 2,000 employees in the aftermath of the Trump administration's massive reduction in foreign aid funding.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is a difficult day for our entire community. The termination of more than US$800 million in USAID funding is now forcing us to wind down critical work here in Baltimore and internationally," the school, a leading institution of scientific research, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopkins, in Maryland's largest city an hour's drive north of the US capital, is eliminating more than 2,000 positions - 1,975 in projects across 44 countries and 247 jobs in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts impact several key programs, including the university's medical school and school of public health, and Jhpiego, a global health non-profit organisation founded at the university more than 50 years ago and which works to improve health in countries worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Johns Hopkins is immensely proud of the work done by our colleagues in Jhpiego, the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the School of Medicine to care for mothers and infants, fight disease, provide clean drinking water, and advance countless other critical, life-saving efforts around the world," the university said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts make Johns Hopkins one of the universities most deeply impacted by the slash of federal funding for research.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university receives roughly US$1 billion annually in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is currently running 600 clinical trials, according to The New York Times, adding that Hopkins is one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging such cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Agency for International Development (USAID), the largest funding agency for Jhpiego, distributes humanitarian aid around the world, with health and emergency programs in around 120 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, who is dismantling the humanitarian agency, signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to allow time to assess overseas expenses. Critics warn that slashing USAID work will affect millions of people. (AFP)

    Duterte's first court appearance set for Friday

<img alt="People protest against former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte in front of the ICC in the Hague. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795667_1_20250314085246.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodrigo Duterte's first appearance at the International Criminal Court has been set for Friday, the court said, as the former Philippines president faces crimes against humanity charges over his deadly war on drugs.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the court late on Thursday said Duterte's first appearance would take place at 2 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old will appear before judges for a hearing where he will be informed of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed tens of thousands of people.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he landed in The Hague, the former leader appeared to accept responsibility for his actions, saying in a Facebook video: "I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's stunning arrest in Manila came amid a spectacular meltdown in relations between his family and the Marcos family, who had previously joined forces to run the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice-President Sara Duterte - Rodrigo's daughter - are at loggerheads, with the latter facing an impeachment trial over charges including an alleged assassination plot against Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte is in The Netherlands to support her father, after labelling his arrest "oppression and persecution", with the Duterte family having sought an emergency injunction from the Supreme Court to stop his transfer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The high-profile Duterte case also comes at a critical moment for the ICC, as it faces unprecedented pressure from all sides, including US sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court over what he said were "illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Gaza war. (AFP)

    Trump threatens tariffs on EU alcohol

<img alt="President Trump's tariff threat could hit a market worth US$10 billion to EU producers in 2023, according to World Trade Organization figures. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795656_1_20250314055609.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to slap a 200 percent tariff on wine, cognac, and other alcohol imports from Europe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's threat came in response to a European Union plan to impose tariffs on American whisky and other products next month - which itself is a response to Trump's 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports that took effect on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission had no immediate comment on Trump's post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, a neighbour and close ally that is the US's biggest aluminium provider, has also announced countermeasures of its own to Trump's metals tariffs and has taken the dispute to the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  At an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte later on Thursday, he said he would not back off from reciprocal tariffs he has vowed to impose on all trading partners on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been ripped off for years, and we're not going to be ripped off," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcohol is shaping up to be a key friction point in the brewing trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the EU's proposed countermeasures, worth US$28.31 billion in all, would apply to products that have little more than symbolic value, such as dental floss and bathrobes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the proposed 50 percent duty on US bourbon would be a significant hit for the industry, which has seen exports grow steadily since the United States lifted tariffs Trump imposed during his first term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU accounted for roughly 40 percent of all spirits exports in 2023, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Likewise, the United States accounts for 31 percent of EU wine and spirits exports, according to Eurostat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry officials on both sides of the Atlantic urged their leaders to de-escalate. "This cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation must end now!" said spiritsEurope, an industry trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump says tariffs are a crucial tool to revitalise US industries that have withered due to decades of globalisation. But US importers and distributors said it would lead to lost sales, layoffs, and shuttered businesses. (Reuters)

<img alt="Police officers detain a protester inside Trump Tower during a rally against the ICE detention of Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795650_1_20250314053853.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scores of people poured into the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday to protest the arrest and detention of Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, whom the Trump administration aims to deport over his pro-Palestinian activism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The arrest of Khalil, who is in immigration custody in Louisiana after his arrest in New York on Saturday, has sparked an outcry by Democratic lawmakers, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian territories, and civil liberty advocates, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jewish Voice for Peace, which describes itself as a progressive Jewish anti-Zionist organisation, carried out Thursday's demonstration. The group said it was "taking over the Trump Tower to register our mass refusal."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not stand by as this fascist regime attempts to criminalise Palestinians and all those calling for an end to the Israeli government’s US-funded genocide of the Palestinian people," the group said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump Tower, located on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, is home to the Trump Organisation and where President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump own a penthouse apartment. Their son, Barron, has been living there since beginning his freshman year at New York University in the fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 150 protesters gathered at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the New York Police Department estimated. Images on social media showed demonstrators carrying signs saying: "FIGHT NAZIS NOT STUDENTS" and "FREE MAHMOUD FREE PALESTINE."
  <br>
  <br>
  Video showed police arresting some of the protesters. The NYPD said 98 arrests were made.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaz Daughtry, the deputy mayor for public safety, said on Fox News that there were no injuries and all the protesters had been removed from the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump Organisation did not immediately provide comment. By arresting Khalil on Saturday, the Trump administration began fulfilling its campaign promise to deport foreign-born activists who participated in the wave of protests on U.S. college campuses last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States, has been a prominent figure in the pro-Palestinian student movement at Columbia, perhaps the most prominent of the dozens of U.S. universities where demonstrations erupted last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump branded Khalil a "Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student" on social media and has said his arrest is the first "of many to come." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he had "serious questions" about Washington's plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but Moscow was ready to discuss it with US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Putin made his first comments on the plan, which Ukraine agreed to on Tuesday at talks with the United States, saying he was "for" the proposed ceasefire, but "there are nuances," and he had "serious questions" about how it would work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin told reporters, "I think we need to talk to our American colleagues... Maybe have a phone call with President Trump and discuss this with him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has called for Russia to agree to a ceasefire without any conditions, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying on Tuesday, "That's what we want to know, if they're prepared to do it unconditionally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Putin's statement was "promising" but "not complete."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've actually discussed many of the details of a final agreement." Now we're going to see if Russia is there, and, if not, it will be a very disappointing moment for the world," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After visiting a military headquarters in the Kursk region Wednesday, the Russian president hailed troops' progress against Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Trump pushes for a speedy end to the more than three-year conflict, his envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow Thursday to discuss the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has expressed optimism that his team can secure a ceasefire, despite Moscow's battlefield gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can get Russia to stop, then we have a full ceasefire. And I think it'll never go back to war," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier Thursday had criticised the lack of an official response from Moscow, saying on social media that this shows "Russia seeks to prolong the war and postpone peace for as long as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of talks, Putin said, "We agree with proposals to cease hostilities, but on the basis that cessation would lead to long-term peace and address the root causes of the crisis." (AFP)

 The bodies of at least 25 people, including 21 hostages, killed in a train siege by separatist gunmen in Pakistan were retrieved from the site yesterday ahead of the first funerals, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Security forces said they freed more than 340 passengers in a two-day rescue operation that ended late on Wednesday after a separatist group bombed a remote track in mountainous southwest Balochistan and stormed a train with around 450 passengers on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army, one of a number of separatist groups that accuse outsiders of plundering natural resources in Balochistan near the borders with Afghanistan and Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Death tolls have varied, with the military saying that "21 innocent hostages" were killed as well as four soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A railway official said the bodies of the 25 people were transported by train away from the site of the siege to the nearby town of Mach on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deceased were identified as 19 military passengers, one police and one railway official, while four bodies are yet to be identified," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers who escaped said after walking for hours through rugged mountains to reach safety that they saw people being shot dead by militants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first funerals are expected to take place on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif was also expected to visit Balochistan, his office said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean military investigators charged two air force pilots on Thursday with criminal negligence over an accidental bombing of a village last week during a training exercise, which injured at least 29 people and caused extensive property damage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defence ministry investigators have confirmed that errors by the pilots when they entered coordinates into the aircraft systems were "direct factors" behind the accidental bombing, the ministry's Criminal Investigation Command said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilots were charged with criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the command said, adding the investigation of the incident is ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight unguided air-to-surface bombs were launched from two fighter jets and landed on a village in Pocheon near the border with North Korea during live-fire exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several areas in Pocheon and neighbouring regions have training grounds used by the South Korean and US militaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents have for years complained about potential safety risks and disturbances from military units being mobilised in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two pilots have been taken off flight duties and a review of their flight mission certification has been scheduled, a ministry official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The air force chief of staff has apologised for the accident and pledged to review mission procedures to prevent similar incidents. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A US judge on Wednesday extended his order blocking federal authorities from deporting a detained Columbia University student, in a case that has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's pledge to deport some pro-Palestinian college activists.
 <br>
  <br>
  US District Judge Jesse Furman had temporarily blocked Mahmoud Khalil's deportation earlier this week, and extended the prohibition on Wednesday in a written order following a hearing in Manhattan federal court to allow himself more time to consider whether the arrest was unconstitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Homeland Security says Khalil is subject to deportation under a legal provision holding that migrants whose presence in the country are deemed by the US Secretary of State to be incompatible with foreign policy may be removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States," read the DHS document, dated March 9, ordering Khalil to appear before an immigration judge on March 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document did not provide additional detail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DHS did not immediately responded to requests for comment from reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khalil's lawyers say his arrest on Saturday by DHS agents outside his university residence in Manhattan was in retaliation for his outspoken advocacy against Israel's assault on Gaza following Hamas' October 2023 attack, and thus violated Khalil's right to free speech under the US Constitution's First Amendment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr. Khalil was identified, targeted, detained and is being processed for deportation on account of his advocacy for Palestinian rights," Khalil's lawyer Ramzi Kassem said in court. (Reuters)

    China, EU vow countermeasures against US steel tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the EU vowed on Wednesday to strike back and defend their economic interests against sweeping new US steel and aluminium tariffs, moving Washington closer to an all-out trade war with two major partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  The levies took effect just after midnight on Wednesday "with no exceptions or exemptions", as promised by the White House – despite countries' efforts to avert them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said it would impose "a series of countermeasures" from April 1 in response to the "unjustified trade restrictions" from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply regret this measure," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, adding that "the countermeasures we take today are strong but proportionate".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US are applying tariffs worth US$28 billion, we are responding with countermeasures worth" the equivalent in euros, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And China, the world's leading steel manufacturer – though not a major exporter of the product to the United States – vowed "all necessary measures" in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's tariffs would "seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system", she warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed steep tariffs on major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China since returning to office, allowing only a partial rollback for his country's neighbours while vowing fresh levies from April 2. (AFP)
