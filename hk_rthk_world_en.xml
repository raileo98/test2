<div class="itemFullText">
 A Jeju Air plane carrying 181 people from Bangkok to South Korea crashed on arrival Sunday, killing at least 120, emergency services said, with a bird strike and adverse weather conditions cited as likely causes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two survivors -- one crew and one passenger -- were plucked from the wreckage as part of an ongoing rescue operation, the national fire agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video shared by the local MBC broadcaster showed the Jeju Air plane landing at Muan International Airport's runway, with smoke streaming out from the engines, before the entire aircraft was quickly engulfed in flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of the accident is presumed to be a bird strike combined with adverse weather conditions. However, the exact cause will be announced following a joint investigation," Lee Jeong-hyun, chief of Muan fire station, said during a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee had earlier warned that "the tally could rise due to the critically injured".
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident took place at 9.03am local time (0003 GMT) on Sunday during the landing of Jeju Air Flight 2216, the Ministry of Land said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A total of 175 passengers -- including two Thai nationals -- and six crew members were onboard," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air apologised and vowed to do all it could to help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We at Jeju Air will do everything in our power in response to this accident. We sincerely apologise for causing concern," the airline said in a statement posted on its social media channels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting President Choi Sang-mok called for the mobilisation of all resources to save the passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All related agencies... must mobilise all available resources to save the personnel," he instructed officials in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi convened an emergency meeting with cabinet members to discuss rescue operations and response, his office said, adding that the acting president, who took office only on Friday, is on his way to Muan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, expressed deep condolences to the families of those affected by the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn said in a social media post that she had ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first fatal accident in the history of Jeju Air, one of South Korea's largest low-cost carriers, which was set up in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  On August 12, 2007, a Bombardier Q400 operated by Jeju Air carrying 74 passengers came off the runway due to strong winds at the southern Busan-Gimhae airport, resulting in a dozen injuries. (AFP, AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Norwegian police said an officer in his twenties and a suspect had died after an overnight shootout on Saturday in the Nordic nation where police rarely die in the line of duty.
 <br>
  <br>
  The last time a police officer was shot and killed in the line of duty in Norway dated back to 2004, according to the Norwegian news broadcaster NRK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's deadly shooting took place in Klepp near the city of Stavanger in southwest Norway, and also resulted in another officer being wounded, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The mission last night had the worst possible outcome. Two human lives have been lost and the police have lost a dear colleague," said police commissioner Marie Benedicte Bjornland in a statement on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the ultimate and most tragic consequence of police work," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had been alerted to reports of a threatening situation involving weapons after midnight on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two police officers and the suspected gunman in his forties, who was sitting in a car, were shot in the subsequent exchange of gunfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critically injured, one of the police officers and the suspected man died on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fatal shootings of police officers are extremely rare in Norway and the other Nordic nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very serious and tragic event that affects us all", said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store to NRK. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli military raid targeting Hamas militants has forced a major hospital in northern Gaza out of service and led to the detention of its director, the WHO and health officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The assault on Kamal Adwan Hospital has rendered the facility "useless", further worsening Gaza's severe health crisis, the Palestinian territory's health officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organisation said the operation had put the "last major health facility in north Gaza out of service."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Initial reports indicate that some key departments were severely burnt and destroyed during the raid," it added in a statement on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said 60 health workers and 25 patients in critical condition, including some on ventilators, reportedly remained in the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients in moderate to severe condition were forced to evacuate to the destroyed, non-functioning Indonesian Hospital, the UN health agency said, adding it was "deeply concerned for their safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry reported that Israeli forces had detained Kamal Adwan's director, Hossam Abu Safiyeh, along with several medical staff members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said Abu Safiyeh was held alongside its north Gaza chief, Ahmed Hassan al-Kahlout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military did not comment on the detentions. (AFP)

    EU universal charger rules come into force

<img alt="Apple, the world's biggest seller of smartphones, had been slow to comply. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785316_1_20241228205033.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU rules requiring all new smartphones, tablets and cameras to use the same charger came into force on Saturday, in a change Brussels said will cut costs and waste.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manufacturers are now obliged to fit devices sold in the 27-nation bloc with a USB-C, the port chosen by the European Union as the common standard for charging electronic tools.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting today, all new mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, headphones, speakers, keyboards and many other electronics sold in the EU will have to be equipped with a USB Type-C charging port," the EU Parliament wrote on social media X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU has said the single charger rule will simplify the lives of Europeans and slash costs for consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  By allowing consumers to purchase a new device without a new charger, it will also reduce the mountain of obsolete chargers, the bloc has argued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law was first approved in 2022 following a tussle with US tech giant Apple. It allowed companies until December 28 this year to adapt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Makers of laptops will have extra time, from early 2026, to also follow suit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most devices already use these cables, but Apple was more than a little reluctant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said in 2021 that such regulation "stifles innovation", but by September last year it had begun shipping phones with the new port.
  <br>
  <br>
  Makers of electronic consumer items in Europe had agreed on a single charging norm from dozens on the market a decade ago under a voluntary agreement with the European Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Apple, the world's biggest seller of smartphones, refused to abide by it and ditch its Lightning ports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other manufacturers kept their alternative cables going, meaning there were about half a dozen types knocking around, creating a jumble of cables for consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  USB-C ports can charge at up to 100 Watts, transfer data up to 40 gigabits per second, and be used to hook up to external displays.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time of its approval, the commission said the law was expected to save at least 200 million euros (US$208 million) per year and cut more than a thousand tonnes of EU electronic waste every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's time for THE charger," the European Commission wrote on X on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means better charging technology, reduced e-waste, and less fuss to find the chargers you need." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia warned on Saturday of severe environmental damage from a huge oil spill in the Black Sea caused when two tankers collided in a storm near Crimea, which declared a state of emergency.
 <br>
  <br>
  One tanker sank and another ran aground on December 15 in the Kerch Strait between Russia and the annexed Crimean peninsula.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of volunteers have been mobilised for clean-up operations that have been criticised as insufficient by some Russian scientists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tankers were carrying 9,200 tonnes of fuel oil, around 40 percent of which may have spilled into the sea, according to authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation is truly critical," said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, quoted by Russian press agencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unfortunately impossible to calculate for the moment the extent of the environmental damage but specialists are working regularly on it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Moscow-installed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksionov, said on Telegram he had declared a state of emergency "because of the oil products spill in the Kerch Strait."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's transport ministry insisted on Saturday that "all polluted aquatic areas that have been identified have been cleaned" and "no recurring pollution has been detected."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Kurenkov was more cautious, saying: "The threat of a new fuel oil leak in the Black Sea from the tankers and spills on the coast persists."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Vladimir Putin earlier this month called the oil spill an "ecological disaster." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Air travellers in Britain faced further disruption on Saturday, as fog that has blanketed much of the country in recent days grounded flights and hampered landings and take-offs.
 <br>
  <br>
  London Gatwick airport was most affected, according to aircraft tracking website Flightradar24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Various airports saw disruption on Friday, including Manchester and the country's busiest hub, Heathrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As widespread fog continues to affect some UK airports today, temporary air traffic restrictions remain in place at locations with low visibility," the air traffic control authority NATS said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the restrictions were to maintain safety and that its teams were working closely with the airports and airlines to minimise disruption.

  In some areas, thick fog patches could reduce visibility down to just 100 metres, Britain's weather agency, the Met Office, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Gatwick Airport said the temporary air traffic restrictions in place due to fog causing poor visibility could lead to delays "throughout the day."
  <br>
  <br>
  The disruption comes at one of the busiest times of the year for air travel. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India on Saturday accorded former premier Manmohan Singh, one of the architects of the country's economic liberalisation in the early 1990s, a state funeral with full military honours, complete with a gun salute.
 <br>
  <br>
  Singh, who held office from 2004 to 2014, died at the age of 92 on Thursday, after which seven days of state mourning were declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  The honours were led by President Draupadi Murmu with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in attendance, along with the country's top civilian and military officials. Bhutan's King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck also attended the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who called the former prime minister his mentor and guide, joined Singh's family as they prayed before his cremation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, mourners gathered to pay their respects to Singh. His coffin, draped in garlands of flowers, was flanked by a guard of honour and carried to his Congress Party headquarters in New Delhi.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was then taken through the capital to the cremation grounds, accompanied by guards of soldiers and accorded full state honours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi called Singh one of India's "most distinguished leaders."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden called Singh a "true statesman," saying that he "charted pathbreaking progress that will continue to strengthen our nations – and the world – for generations to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former prime minister was an understated technocrat who was hailed for overseeing an economic boom in his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh's second stint ended with a series of major corruption scandals, slowing growth and high inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh's unpopularity in his second term, and lacklustre leadership by Nehru-Gandhi scion Rahul Gandhi, the current opposition leader in the lower house, led to Modi's first landslide victory in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1932 in the mud-house village of Gah in what is now Pakistan and was then British-ruled India, Singh studied economics to find a way to eradicate poverty in the vast nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won scholarships to attend both Cambridge, where he obtained a first in economics, and Oxford, where he completed his doctorate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh worked in a string of senior civil service posts, served as a central bank governor and also held various jobs with global agencies including the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was tapped in 1991 by then Congress prime minister PV Narasimha Rao to serve as finance minister and reel India back from the worst financial crisis in its modern history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though he had never held an elected post, he was declared the National Congress's candidate for the highest office in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first term, Singh steered the economy through a period of nine percent growth, lending India the international clout it had long sought.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also sealed a landmark nuclear deal with the United States that he said would help India meet its growing energy needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Murmu said Singh would "always be remembered for his service to the nation, his unblemished political life and his utmost humility." (AFP)

    'Yoon authorised shooting during martial law bid'

<img alt='According to a prosecution indictment report, troops trying to enter the National Assembly on December 3 were told to get in quickly, "even if it means shooting." Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785298_1_20241228161211.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol authorised the military to fire their weapons if needed to enter parliament during his failed bid to impose martial law, according to a prosecutors' report.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 10-page summary from former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun's prosecution indictment report, which was provided to the media, also says Yoon vowed on December 3 to declare martial law three times if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, who was stripped of his duties by the National Assembly this month, is under investigation for his short-lived attempt to scrap civilian rule, which plunged the country into political turmoil and led to his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer Yoon Kab-keun dismissed the prosecutors' report, saying it was "a one-sided account that neither corresponds to objective circumstances nor common sense."
  <br>
  <br>
  As lawmakers rushed to parliament on December 3 to vote down Yoon's martial law declaration, heavily armed troops stormed the building, scaling fences, smashing windows and landing by helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the prosecution indictment report, Yoon told the chief of the capital defence command, Lee Jin-woo, that military forces could shoot if necessary to enter the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Have you still not got in? What are you doing? Break down the door and drag them out, even if it means shooting," Yoon told Lee, according to the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also allegedly told the head of the Defence Counterintelligence Command, General Kwak Jong-keun, to "quickly get inside" the National Assembly since the quorum for the martial law declaration to be lifted had not been met.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So quickly get inside the National Assembly and bring out the people inside the chamber, and break down the doors with an axe if necessary and drag everyone out," the report quotes Yoon as saying at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  After lawmakers rushed inside parliament and voted 190-0 to nullify Yoon's declaration in the early hours of December 4, the report says Yoon told Lee, "Even if it's lifted, I can declare martial law a second or third time, so just keep going."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also included screenshots of senior defence officials' messages from the day of the martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said there was evidence that Yoon had been discussing declaring martial law with senior military officials as early as March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The declaration followed a budget tussle between Yoon's party and the opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Days later, Yoon said in a speech that he apologised for the "anxiety and inconvenience" and promised that there would not be a second declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ex-defence minister Kim was arrested this month over his role in the failed martial law bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Kang Sun-woo said in a statement on Saturday that "the prosecution has laid bare the undeniable ugly truth about Yoon Suk Yeol, the treasonous ringleader," adding that he must be "arrested immediately."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's Constitutional Court held its first preliminary hearing on the validity of Yoon's impeachment on Friday, with the suspended president's legal team attending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court will also decide the fate of Yoon's replacement, Han Duck-soo, who was impeached on Friday over his refusal to complete Yoon's impeachment process and bring him to justice. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One Mega Millions player has plenty of dough to ring in the New Year after drawing the winning number. After three months without anyone winning the top prize, a ticket worth an estimated US$1.22 billion was sold for the drawing on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The winner matched the white balls 3, 7, 37, 49, 55 and the gold Mega Ball 6. The identity of the winner was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total amount of the Mega Millions jackpot would only be distributed to a winner who chooses an annuity paid over 29 years. Nearly all grand prize winners opt to take a cash payout, which for Friday night’s drawing is an estimated US$549.7 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the game’s long odds of 1 in 302.6 million, players continued to purchase tickets as the size of the grand prize grew. Until Friday, the last time a Mega Millions player hit the top prize was September 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The largest-ever Mega Millions jackpot ticket worth US$1.6 billion was sold in Florida in August 2023. Two prizes for its compatriot Powerball lottery have been larger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mega Millions and Powerball are sold in 45 states, as well as Washington DC, and the US Virgin Islands. Powerball also is sold in Puerto Rico. (AP)

    US homelessness hits new record in 2024: report

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of people in the United States experiencing homelessness reached a new record this year, with lingering inflation and high housing prices among likely drivers, a government report said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An estimated 771,480 people were homeless on a single night in January 2024, rising 18 percent from 2023, said the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in an annual assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  This translates to about 23 in every 10,000 people in the country, home to the world's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The uptick came as households felt the pressure from housing costs, with the median rent for January 2024 being 20 percent higher than that in January 2021, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from housing costs, the HUD report flagged "stagnating wages among middle- and lower-income households, and the persisting effects of systemic racism" as other factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other contributing issues included natural disasters that displaced people, rising immigration and an end to homelessness prevention programs introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While this data is nearly a year old, and no longer reflects the situation we are seeing, it is critical that we focus on evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness," said HUD agency head Adrianne Todman in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night this year, a 33 percent jump over 2023, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children under the age of 18 were the age group seeing the biggest surge in homelessness between 2023 and 2024. (AFP)

    Trump asks US Supreme Court to pause TikTok ban

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump said TikTok is needed for competition. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785258_1_20241228064422.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump filed a brief on Friday urging the Supreme Court to pause a law that would ban TikTok the day before his January 20 inauguration if it is not sold by its Chinese owner ByteDance.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In light of the novelty and difficulty of this case, the court should consider staying the statutory deadline to grant more breathing space to address these issues," Trump's legal team wrote, to give him "the opportunity to pursue a political resolution."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was fiercely opposed to TikTok during his 2017-21 first term, and tried in vain to ban the video app on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump called for a US company to buy TikTok, with the government sharing in the sale price, and his successor Joe Biden went one stage further - signing a law to ban the app for the same reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has now, however, reversed course.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now (that) I'm thinking about it, I'm for TikTok, because you need competition," he recently told Bloomberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you don't have TikTok, you have Facebook and Instagram -- and that's, you know, that's Zuckerberg."
  <br>
  <br>
  Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg and part of his Meta tech empire, was among the social media networks that banned Trump after attacks by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban was driven by concerns that he would use the platform to promote more violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those bans on major social media platforms were later lifted.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the brief filed on Friday, Trump's lawyer made it clear the president-elect did not take a position on the legal merits of the current case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute," John Sauer wrote in the amicus curiae - or "friend of the court" - brief.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, he respectfully requests that the court consider staying the act's deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case, thus permitting President Trump's incoming Administration the opportunity to pursue a political resolution of the questions at issue in the case." (AFP)

<img alt="Frank-Walter Steinmeier announces a new election will be held on February 23 next year. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785236_1_20241227214510.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier dissolved parliament on Friday and confirmed the expected February date for an early general election after the collapse of Olaf Scholz's government last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholz's coalition was brought down by internal fights over how to revive Europe's largest economy, but a deadly car-ramming attack at a Christmas market last week has renewed the country's heated debates over security and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirming the February 23 date for the election, Steinmeier emphasised the need for "political stability" and appealed for the campaign to be "conducted with respect and decency."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Saudi doctor, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, 50, was arrested at the scene of the attack on the Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg which left five people dead and more than 200 injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Nancy Fraser has said Abdulmohsen held "Islamophobic" views but his exact motive remains unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the wake of the attack, Scholz appealed to Germans to "link arms" and to not allow "hatred to determine our coexistence."
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative CDU/CSU is leading in the polls on around 32 percent under its leader Friedrich Merz and even before last week's attack it had been promising a harder line on immigration as well as a rightward shift on social and economic policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In second place on 19 percent is the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which held what it called a "memorial" rally in Magdeburg on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the event, the AfD's regional leader Jan Wenzel Schmidt said Germany could "no longer take in madmen from all over the world" and demanded the country "close the borders." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's parliament impeached acting President Han Duck-soo on Friday over a short-lived martial law, plunging the country deeper into political chaos, as the Constitutional Court said it would swiftly trial suspended President Yoon Suk-yeol.
 <br>
  <br>
  The impeachment of Han, who has been acting president since Yoon was impeached on December 14 for declaring martial law on December 3, has thrown South Korea's once-vibrant democratic success story into uncharted territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motion led by opposition parties passed with 192 of the 300 votes amid rowdy scenes by ruling People Power Party members who surrounded the speaker's podium, chanting the vote was invalid and parliament had committed "tyranny".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the parliamentary session, opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said his Democratic Party, which has majority control of parliament, will go ahead with the plan to impeach the acting president, accusing Han of "acting for insurrection".

  "The only way to normalise the country is to swiftly root out all the insurrection forces," Lee said in a fiery speech, adding the party was acting on the public order to eradicate those who have put the country at risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  There has been overwhelming public support for Yoon's removal, according to opinion polls conducted after his martial law attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan for a vote to impeach Han was unveiled on Thursday by the main opposition Democratic Party after he declined to immediately appoint three justices to fill vacancies at the Constitutional Court, saying it would exceed his acting role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until just before voting began, it was unclear how many votes were needed to impeach Han as acting leader. The threshold for a prime minister is a simple majority, while a two-thirds majority is needed for a president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaker Woo Won-shik declared a simple majority would constitute parliamentary approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said in a statement after the vote that he would step aside to avoid more chaos and will await a Constitutional Court ruling on his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok will assume the acting presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi earlier pleaded with parliament to withdraw the plan to impeach Han, saying it would do serious damage to the country's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean won retreated to 1,475.4 per dollar, down 0.53 percent at 0707 GMT ahead of the parliamentary vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vote to determine Han's fate comes on the same day the Constitutional Court held its first hearing in a case reviewing whether to overturn the impeachment and reinstate Yoon or remove him permanently from office. It has 180 days to reach a decision. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's government on Friday approved a record budget for the next fiscal year, ramping up spending on social welfare and defence.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 115.5 trillion yen (US$730 billion) budget for the year from April 2025, greenlit by the cabinet, includes 8.7 trillion yen in defence spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also includes social security spending of around 38.3 trillion yen – up from 37.7 trillion the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence ministry said in a briefing document that Japan was facing its "toughest and most complex security environment" since the Second World War, repeating a warning from Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 8.7 trillion yen approved on Friday will help pay for measures to help attract recruits to Japan's Self-Defense Forces, and to improve relations between the US and Japanese militaries with locals in Okinawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also go towards a system to collect satellite information on ballistic missiles, such as those fired by North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another challenge facing the country is its ageing population caused by chronically low birth rates and a cautious approach to immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan is one of the world's oldest societies, and this year the proportion of its people aged 65 or over reached a record 29.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draft budget needs to be approved by the parliament, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its smaller coalition partner Komeito will need cooperation from opposition parties, having lost their majority in an October snap election. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's spy agency said on Friday it had confirmed that a North Korean soldier sent to back Russia's war against Ukraine had been captured by Ukrainian forces.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pyongyang has deployed thousands of troops to reinforce Russian troops, including in the Kursk border region where Ukraine mounted a shock border incursion in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through real-time information sharing with an allied country's intelligence agency, it has been confirmed that one injured North Korean soldier has been captured," South Korea's National Intelligence Service said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The soldier was captured by the Ukrainian army, an intelligence source told AFP news agency, adding that the location where he was seized was unknown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first confirmation of the capture of a North Korean soldier came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday that nearly 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been "killed or wounded" so far. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff also said on Monday that more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korean state media said on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a New Year's message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying "the bilateral ties between our two countries have been elevated after our talks in June in Pyongyang".
  <br>
  <br>
  A landmark defence pact went into effect in December after the two sides exchanged ratification documents. Putin hailed the deal in June as a "breakthrough document". (AFP)

    Finland suspects ship of breaching undersea cables

<div class="itemFullText">
 Finnish authorities have seized a ship carrying Russian oil in the Baltic Sea on suspicion it caused the outage of an undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia a day earlier, and that it also damaged or broke four internet lines.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cook Islands-registered ship, named by authorities as the Eagle S, was boarded by a Finnish coast guard crew on Thursday, that took command and sailed the vessel to Finnish waters, a coast guard official said at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to our understanding, an anchor of the vessel that is under investigation has caused the damage," said Robin Lardot, director of the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two fibre-optic cables owned by Finnish operator Elisa, linking Finland and Estonia, were broken while a third link between the two countries owned by China's Citic was damaged, Finnish transport and communications agency Traficom said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fourth internet cable running between Finland and Germany and belonging to Finnish group Cinia was also believed to have been severed, the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the Finnish and Estonian governments held extraordinary meetings on Thursday to assess the situation, they said in separate statements.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference following the meeting, Estonian officials agreed with the Finnish authorities' suspicion that the Cook Islands-flagged tanker Eagle S "intentionally" struck the offshore cable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Repairing the 170-km Estlink 2 interconnector will take months, and the outage raised the risk of a strained power supply during the winter, operator Fingrid said in a statement. (Agencies)

    India's former PM Manmohan Singh dies aged 92

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manmohan Singh, the former Indian prime minister whose economic reforms made his country a global powerhouse, has died at the age of 92, current leader Narendra Modi said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  India "mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished leaders," Modi posted on social media platform X shortly after news broke of Singh's passing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve people's lives."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh was taken to a hospital in New Delhi after he lost consciousness at his home on Thursday, but could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead at 9:51 pm local time, according to a statement by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh, who held office from 2004 to 2014, is credited with having overseen an economic boom in Asia's fourth-largest economy in his first term, although slowing growth in later years marred his second stint.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have lost a mentor and guide," opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said in a statement, adding that Singh had "led India with immense wisdom and integrity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Millions of us who admired him will remember him with the utmost pride," said Gandhi, a scion of India's powerful Nehru-Gandhi dynasty and the most prominent challenger to Modi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of the opposition in parliament's upper house, said "India has lost a visionary statesman, a leader of unimpeachable integrity, and an economist of unparalleled stature."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Droupadi Murmu wrote on X that Singh will "always be remembered for his service to the nation, his unblemished political life and his utmost humility."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1932 in the mud-house village of Gah in what is now Pakistan, Singh studied economics to find a way to eradicate poverty in India and never held elected office before taking the vast nation's top job.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won scholarships to attend both Cambridge, where he obtained a first in economics, and Oxford, where he completed his PhD.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh worked in a string of senior civil posts, served as a central bank governor and also held various jobs with global agencies including the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was tapped in 1991 by then Congress prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to reel India back from the worst financial crisis in its modern history.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first term Singh steered the economy through a period of nine-percent growth, lending India the international clout it had long sought. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Membership of Britain's upstart anti-immigration Reform UK party has overtaken that of the centre-right Conservative Party for the first time, the party said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Party leader and Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage hailed the figure as an "historic moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Immigration was a major issue at the ballot box at the UK's July general election which saw the Conservatives ousted after 14 years in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The digital counter on the Reform website showed a membership tally ticking past the 131,680 figure declared by the main opposition Conservatives during its leadership election earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The youngest political party in British politics has just overtaken the oldest political party in the world," wrote Farage on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reform UK are now the real opposition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Party chairman Zia Yusuf said the milestone showed the long "stranglehold on the centre-right of British politics by the Tories has finally been broken."
  <br>
  <br>
  The last declared Conservative Party tally was the lowest on record and a drop on 2022 when there were around 172,000 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reform won five seats in the 650-seat UK parliament in July, although it received roughly 14 percent of total votes cast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reform maximised the damage to the Conservatives by splitting the right-wing vote and picking up former Tory supporters in key constituencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Party won by a landslide although Prime Minister Keir Starmer has had a bumpy first five months in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Ipsos opinion poll earlier this month found that 53 percent of Britons said they were "disappointed" in what the Labour government had achieved so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  British politics has been dominated by the two main political parties – Labour and the Conservatives – for decades. but commentators have warned that major political parties have seen irreversible downturns in their popularity in the past. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 10,457 migrants died or disappeared while trying to reach Spain by sea in 2024, an NGO said on Thursday, more than 50 percent more than last year and the most since it began keeping a tally in 2007.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 58-percent increase includes 1,538 children and 421 women, migrants' rights group Caminando Fronteras or Walking Borders said in a report which covers the period from January 1 to December 5, 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  It amounts to an average of 30 deaths per day, up from around 18 in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group compiles its data from hotlines set up for migrants on vessels in trouble to call for help, families of migrants who went missing and from official rescue statistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  It blamed the use of flimsy boats and increasingly dangerous routes as well as the insufficient capacity of maritime rescue services for the surge in deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These figures are evidence of a profound failure of rescue and protection systems. More than 10,400 people dead or missing in a single year is an unacceptable tragedy," the group's founder, Helena Maleno, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victims were from 28 nations, mostly in Africa, but also from Iraq and Pakistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of the fatalities – 9,757 – took place on the Atlantic migration route from Africa to Spain's Canary Islands, which has received a record number of migrants for the second year in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven migrant boats landed in the archipelago on Wednesday, Christmas Day, Spain's maritime rescue service said on social media site X.
  <br>
  <br>
  At their closest point, the Canaries lie 100 kilometres off the coast of North Africa. The shortest route is between the coastal town of Tarfaya in southern Morocco and the island of Fuerteventura in the Canaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Atlantic route to the Canary Islands is particularly dangerous because of strong currents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Along with Italy and Greece, Spain is one of the three major European gateways for migrant arrivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the interior ministry, 60,216 migrants entered Spain irregularly between January 1 and December 15 – a 14.5 percent increase over the same time last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority, over 70 percent, landed in the Canaries. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Palestinian TV channel affiliated with a militant group said five of its journalists were killed on Thursday in an Israeli strike on their vehicle in Gaza, with Israel's military saying it had targeted a "terrorist cell."
 <br>
  <br>
  A missile hit the journalists' broadcast truck as it was parked in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to a statement from their employer, Al-Quds Today.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is affiliated with Islamic Jihad, whose militants have fought alongside Hamas in the Gaza Strip and took part in the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The channel identified the five staffers as Faisal Abu Al-Qumsan, Ayman Al-Jadi, Ibrahim Al-Sheikh Khalil, Fadi Hassouna and Mohammed Al-Lada'a.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were killed "while performing their journalistic and humanitarian duty," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We affirm our commitment to continue our resistant media message," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said in its own statement that it had conducted "a precise strike on a vehicle with an Islamic Jihad terrorist cell inside in the area of Nuseirat."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that "prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to witnesses in Nuseirat, a missile fired by an Israeli aircraft hit the broadcast vehicle, which was parked outside Al-Awda Hospital, setting the vehicle on fire and killing those inside.

  <br>
  The Committee to Protect Journalists' Middle East arm said the organisation was "devastated by the reports that five journalists and media workers were killed inside their broadcasting vehicle by an Israeli strike."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Journalists are civilians and must always be protected," it added in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said last week that more than 190 journalists had been killed and at least 400 injured since the start of the war in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was triggered by the Hamas-led October 7 attack last year, which resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 45,361 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the UN considers reliable. (AFP)

<img alt="The fire has so far destroyed about one-third of the Grampians National Park. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785060_1_20241226171154.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian authorities urged people in dozens of rural communities to leave home "immediately" on Thursday to escape an out-of-control bushfire tearing through a national park.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 600 firefighters were battling the blaze in the Grampians National Park 240 kilometres west of Melbourne, a Victoria state emergency services spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze has persisted for more than a week in hot, windy conditions, scorching 55,000 hectares (136,000 acres) – about one-third of the park – so far without causing any deaths or destroying homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  State emergency services warned residents to leave home immediately in more than two dozen mostly small rural communities, with populations ranging from as few as six to as many as several hundred.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in several other communities were told to take shelter indoors because it was unsafe to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters expected shifting winds to complicate their task during the day, said Victoria state control centre spokesman Luke Hegarty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are reaching a critical part of the day when we see the wind change moving through the western part of the state," he said in an afternoon update.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're expecting strong winds and variable winds to be a concern for us over the next few hours."
  <br>
  <br>
  A total fire ban was declared across the whole of Victoria, barring any fires in the open air. (AFP)

    S Korea's opposition moves to impeach acting president

<img alt="Han Duck-soo could become the first acting South Korean president to be impeached. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785049_1_20241226160601.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's opposition said on Thursday it had filed an impeachment motion against acting president Han Duck-soo, in an escalating row over the composition of the Constitutional Court which would decide whether to remove his predecessor from office.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea fell into a political crisis when President Yoon Suk Yeol, currently suspended, declared martial law on December 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was stripped of his duties by parliament on December 14 over the dramatic declaration, but a constitutional court ruling upholding the decision by lawmakers is necessary to complete the impeachment process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court is however currently short of three judges. While it can go ahead with its six members on the bench, a single dissenting vote would reinstate Yoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition wants Han to approve three more nominees to fill the bench, something that he has so far refused to do, essentially leaving both sides in a deadlock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition Democratic Party therefore wants the acting president impeached too.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have filed the motion... and will report it to the plenary session today," MP Park Sung-joon told reporters at the National Assembly of the action against Han.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will put it to a vote tomorrow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Han's refusal to formally appoint the three judges proves that he "does not have the will or qualification to uphold the constitution," the Democratic Party's floor leader Park Chan-dae told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han has said that he would certify the judges' appointments only if his ruling People Power Party (PPP) and the opposition reach a compromise on the nominees.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The consistent principle embedded in our constitution and laws is to refrain from exercising significant exclusive presidential powers, including the appointment of constitutional institutions," Han argued.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A consensus between the ruling and opposition parties in the National Assembly, representing the people, must first be reached," added the 75-year-old career bureaucrat.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the opposition passes the impeachment motion against Han in Friday's vote, it would mark the first time democratic South Korea has impeached an acting president.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Han's place, Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok would step in as acting president.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the impeachment motion, the opposition accuses Han of violating his duty as acting president, citing his refusal to formally appoint the judges and promulgate two special probe bills to investigate Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law and graft allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee.

    Tsunami memorials begin across Asia 20 years on

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Emotional ceremonies began across Asia on Thursday to remember the 220,000 people who died two decades ago when a tsunami devastated coastal areas around the Indian Ocean, in one of the worst natural disasters in human history.
 <br>
  <br>
  On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake off Indonesia's western tip generated a series of massive waves that pummelled the coastline of 14 countries, from Indonesia to Somalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Indonesia's Aceh Province where more than 100,000 people were killed, a siren rang out for three minutes at the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque, followed by Islamic prayers to kick off a series of memorials scheduled around the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesian mourners will attend a mass grave ceremony and a communal evening prayer in provincial capital Banda Aceh, while beachside memorials and religious ceremonies were scheduled in Sri Lanka, India and Thailand, some of the worst hit countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought it was doomsday," said Hasnawati, a 54-year-old teacher who goes by one name, at the mosque which was damaged by the tsunami.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On a Sunday morning where our family were all laughing together, suddenly a disaster struck and everything's gone. I can't describe it with words."
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims of waves as high as 30 metres included many foreign tourists celebrating Christmas on the region's sun-kissed beaches, bringing the tragedy into homes around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seabed being ripped open pushed waves at double the speed of a bullet train, crossing the Indian Ocean within hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 226,408 people died as a result of the tsunami, according to EM-DAT, a recognised global disaster database.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no warning of the impending tsunami, giving little time for evacuation, despite the hours-long gaps between the waves striking different continents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia suffered the highest death toll, with more than 160,000 people killed along its western coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Thailand, where half of the more than 5,000 dead were foreign tourists, unofficial vigils were expected to accompany a government memorial ceremony. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands protested on Wednesday in several areas of Syria after a video circulated showing an attack on an Alawite shrine in the country's north, a war monitor and witnesses said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Syria's new Islamist-led authorities said the footage was "old" and that "unknown groups" were behind the attack, saying "republishing" the video served to "stir up strife", a day after hundreds protested in Damascus against the torching of a Christmas tree.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said "thousands of people" took to the streets on Wednesday, with major demonstrations in the coastal cities of Tartus and Latakia, provinces that are the heartland of the Alawite minority which deposed ruler Bashar al-Assad hails from.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Britain-based Observatory also reported protests in parts of the central city of Homs and other areas including Qardaha, Assad's hometown.
  <br>
  <br>
  State news agency SANA said police in central Homs imposed a curfew from 6:00 pm until 8:00 am local time on Thursday, while local authorities in Jableh also announced a night-time curfew.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the protests erupted after a video began circulating earlier on Wednesday showing "an attack by fighters" on an important Alawite shrine in the Maysaloon district of Syria's second city Aleppo.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said five workers were killed, adding that the shrine was set ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said the video was filmed early this month, after rebels led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched a lightning offensive and seized control of major cities including Aleppo on December 1, ousting Assad a week later. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Azerbaijan Airlines passenger jet crashed on Wednesday in western Kazakhstan, killing 38 of the 67 people on board, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Embraer 190 aircraft was supposed to fly northwest from the Azerbaijani capital Baku to the city of Grozny in southern Russia, but instead flew across the Caspian Sea and went down near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane's course on Flight Radar website showed it flying away from its normal route and then circling over the area where it eventually crashed near Aktau, which is an oil and gas hub on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation is not very good, 38 dead," Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Kanat Bozumbayev as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakh emergency situations ministry reported that "29 survivors including three children have been hospitalised."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakh transport ministry said the plane was carrying 37 nationals from Azerbaijan, six from Kazakhstan, three from Kyrgyzstan and 16 from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Azerbaijan Airlines, the country's flag carrier, said the plane "made an emergency landing" around three kilometres from Aktau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kazakhstan said it had opened an investigation into the cause of the crash, which was not immediately clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot disclose any investigation results at this time," the office of Azerbaijan's prosecutor general said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All possible scenarios are being examined, and the necessary expert analyses are underway," it added. (AFP)

<img alt='The pontiff also called for "aid be given to the people worn out by hunger and by war." Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784983_1_20241225214050.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis called on Wednesday for "arms to be silenced" around the world in his Christmas address, appealing for peace in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan as he denounced the "extremely grave" humanitarian situation in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  He used his traditional message to the world's 1.4 billion Catholics to call for talks for a just peace in Ukraine as the country was pummelled by 170 Russian missiles and drones in a Christmas morning barrage Kyiv branded as "inhumane."
  <br>
  <br>
  His voice breathless, the 88-year-old pontiff also appealed for a ceasefire in Gaza and for the freeing of Israeli hostages held there by Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think of the Christian communities in Israel and Palestine, particularly in Gaza, where the humanitarian situation is extremely grave," he told thousands of the faithful gathered in front of St Peter's Basilica in Rome for the "Urbi et Orbi" ("to the city and the world") address.
  <br>
  <br>
  "May there be a ceasefire, may the hostages be released and aid be given to the people worn out by hunger and by war."
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis also extended his call for peace to Sudan, which has been ravaged by 20 months of brutal civil war and where millions are under the threat of famine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky railed at Russia's attempt to take out his country's battered power grid, with one energy worker killed in the 13th major attack on the system this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Putin deliberately chose Christmas to attack," he said. "What could be more inhumane? More than 70 missiles, including ballistic missiles, and more than 100 attack drones."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has been marking Christmas on December 25 for the past two years rather than on January 7, when most Orthodox believers celebrate, as a snub to Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Russia said five people were killed in Ukrainian strikes on its territory overnight, including one by a downed drone in North Ossetia in the Caucasus.
  <br>
  <br>
  The feast day was also marred by tragedy when an Azerbaijan Airlines jet carrying 67 people from Baku to the Chechen capital Grozny crashed in western Kazakhstan, officials said, though 32 survivors have been reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christmas celebrations were also muted in the biblical birthplace of Jesus, the Israeli-occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the war in Gaza began, the Palestinian town has done away with its giant Christmas tree and the elaborate decorations that normally draw throngs of tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we limited our joy," said Bethlehem mayor Anton Salman.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Latin patriarch, Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, told a small crowd there on Tuesday that he had just returned from Gaza, where he "saw everything destroyed, poverty, disaster".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I also saw life – they don't give up. So you should not give up either. Never."
  <br>
  <br>
  At Manger Square, in the heart of the Palestinian city, a group of scouts held a parade that broke the silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want life, not death," read banners carried by them and "Stop the Gaza genocide now!"
  <br>
  <br>
  About 1,100 Christians live in Gaza, with hundreds gathering at a church there to pray for an end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This Christmas carries the stench of death and destruction," said George al-Sayegh, who has had to take refuge for weeks in the 12th-century Greek Orthodox Church of Saint Porphyrius in Gaza City.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a message to Christians all over the world, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked them for supporting Israel's fight against the "forces of evil."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere in the Middle East, hundreds of people took to the streets in Christian areas of Damascus to protest the burning of a Christmas tree in a Syrian town, just over two weeks after Islamist-led rebels ousted president Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we're not allowed to live our Christian faith in our country, as we used to, then we don't belong here anymore," said a demonstrator who gave his name as George.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Germany, Christmas was also a grim affair for many families after a deadly attack at a market, prompting President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to issue a message of healing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hatred and violence must not have the final word," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Buenos Aires, a Christmas solidarity dinner for the homeless fed around three thousand people at a time when more than half of Argentina's population is affected by poverty.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the United States, where the annual tradition of "tracking" Santa Claus swung into action, a US Air Force general said there was no need to worry that recent mystery drone sightings might affect deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  And in Paris, worshippers gathered at the Notre Dame cathedral for the first Christmas mass since its reopening following a devastating fire in 2019. (AFP)

 The suicide by a train driver on the job has caused widespread delays in France's rail traffic, operator SNCF said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 3,000 train passengers have been affected by delays in services between Paris and southeastern France that started on Tuesday and spilled over into Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 10 high-speed (TGV) trains were delayed by up to five hours on Tuesday after the suicide on Christmas Eve, an exceptionally busy time for travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutor's office in Melun, southeast of Paris, said that the driver appeared to have jumped to his death from the moving train.
  <br>
  <br>
  His body was discovered later near the tracks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without a driver operating the controls, the train's automatic emergency procedure kicked in, causing the train to stop, the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An investigation into the circumstances of the death was ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  SNCF confirmed the driver's death, saying he "committed suicide while the train was moving."
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no threat to the safety of passengers on the train, or to services elsewhere in the network, SNCF added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Train traffic was "resuming progressively" on Wednesday, SNCF said, warning however of some possible further delays. (AFP)

    Impeached S Korean president defies Christmas summons

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol refused a summons to appear for questioning on Christmas Day, the second time he has defied investigators' demands in a week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investigators probing Yoon had ordered him to appear for questioning at 10 am (GMT 0100) on Wednesday, a demand he rejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, a former prosecutor, also failed to attend a hearing he was summoned to last Wednesday, giving no explanation for his absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative leader was stripped of his duties by parliament on December 14, following a short-lived martial law declaration that plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon faces impeachment and criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty, in a drama that has shocked democratic South Korea's allies around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Corruption Investigation Office is expected to decide in the coming days whether to issue a third summons or ask a court to grant an arrest warrant to compel Yoon to appear for questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is being investigated by prosecutors as well as a joint team comprising police, defence ministry, and anti-corruption officials, while the Constitutional Court deliberates on the impeachment motion passed by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  If upheld by the court, which is required to deliver its ruling within six months of the impeachment, a by-election must be held within 60 days of the court's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former president Park Geun-hye was impeached under similar circumstances, but she was investigated only after the Constitutional Court removed her from power.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's opposition said on Tuesday it would hold back a decision to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo until later in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition Democratic Party earlier said it would introduce an impeachment motion against Han to protest the interim leader's refusal to sign into law special bills to investigate Yoon. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan air strikes in an eastern border region of Afghanistan killed 46 civilians, the Taliban government said on Wednesday, whilst a Pakistan security official said the bombardment had targeted "terrorist hideouts."
 <br>
  <br>
  The strikes were the latest spike in hostilities on the frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan, with tensions escalating since the Taliban seized power in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that late on Tuesday Pakistan bombarded four areas in the Barmal district of eastern Paktika province.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women," he said, adding that six more people were wounded, mostly children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Pakistan's foreign ministry nor its military have responded to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a senior Pakistan security official said the strikes were on "terrorist hideouts" using jets and drones and that they killed at least 20 militants from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the country's homegrown Taliban group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Arguments from Afghan officials claiming civilians are being harmed are baseless and misleading," he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Taliban defence ministry statement late on Tuesday condemned the strikes, calling them "barbaric" and a "clear aggression." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Azerbaijan Airlines passenger jet flying from the capital Baku to Grozny in Russia crashed on Wednesday in western Kazakhstan, the Kazakh transport ministry said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A plane doing the Baku-Grozny route crashed near the city of Aktau. It belongs to Azerbaijan Airlines," the ministry said on Telegram.
  <br>
  <br>
  Azerbaijan Airlines, the country's flag carrier, said the Embraer 190 had "made an emergency landing" around three kilometres from Aktau, an oil and gas hub on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakh transport ministry said there were 62 passengers and five crew members on the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country's emergency situations ministry said its personnel were putting out a fire at the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Information about casualties is currently being clarified but, according to preliminary information, there are survivors," it said. (AFP)

    Pope Francis ushers in 2025 Jubilee of 'hope'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis opened the "Holy Door" of St Peter's Basilica on Christmas Eve on Tuesday, launching the Jubilee year of Catholic celebrations set to draw more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff, who has recently been suffering from a cold, was pushed in a wheelchair up to the huge, ornate bronze door and knocked on it, before the doors opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a ceremony watched on screens by thousands of faithful outside in St Peter's Square, the Argentine pontiff went through the door followed by a procession, as the bells of the Vatican basilica rang out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the next 12 months, Catholic pilgrims will pass through the door, which is normally bricked up, by tradition benefiting from a "plenary indulgence", a type of forgiveness for their sins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pope Francis then presided over the Christmas Eve mass in St Peter's, where he turned once again to the victims of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think of wars, of machine-gunned children, of bombs on schools and hospitals," he said in his homily.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope had drawn an angry response from Israel at the weekend for condemning the "cruelty" of Israel's strikes in Gaza that killed children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 700 security officers are being deployed around the Vatican and Rome for the Jubilee celebrations, with measures further tightened following Friday's car-ramming attack on a Christmas market in Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Rome has also been given a facelift in preparation, with monuments such as the Trevi Fountain and the Ponte Sant'Angelo cleaned up and roads redesigned to improve the flow of traffic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many residents have questioned how the Eternal City, where key sites are already overcrowded and public transport is unreliable, will cope with millions more visitors next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key Jubilee projects were only finished in the last few days after months of work that turned much of the city into a building site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inaugurating a new road tunnel at Piazza Pia next to the Vatican on Monday, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said it had taken a "little civil miracle" to get the project finished in time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the course of the next few days, Holy Doors will be opened in Rome's three major basilicas and in Catholic churches around the world. (AFP)

    War-torn Sudan faces 'widening' famine crisis: UN

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Famine has spread across war-torn Sudan and is projected to expand even further, a UN-backed assessment said on Tuesday, with refugee camps and displaced communities hit particularly hard.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) review, which is used by UN agencies, determined that famine had spread to two additional displacement camps in the country's west and parts of the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sudan is reeling from 20 months of fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by rival generals, which have led to a dire humanitarian crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war since April 2023 has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted 12 million, creating what the United Nations has called the world's largest displacement crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its latest report on Tuesday, the IPC said 638,000 people are now facing catastrophic levels of hunger, with a further 8.1 million on the brink of famine.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed alarm, reiterating "his call for the parties to facilitate rapid, safe, unhindered and sustained access so that humanitarian assistance and staff can reach people in need", according to a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IPC found there was famine in three camps in North Darfur - including Zamzam, where famine had already been declared in August - and among residents and displaced communities in the Nuba Mountains, in the southern Kordofan region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between December and May, the IPC said that 24.6 million people representing around half of Sudan's population are projected to face "high levels of acute food insecurity".
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said that this "marks an unprecedented deepening and widening of the food and nutrition crisis".
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), some areas of "intense conflict", including parts of the capital Khartoum and the central state of Al-Jazira, "may already be experiencing famine conditions", but a lack of access to data has prevented an official classification.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guterres, in his remarks on Tuesday, urged "an immediate cessation of hostilities to save lives and prevent the crisis... from escalating even further in 2025", his spokeswoman Stephanie Tremblay said in a statement. (AFP)

<img alt="Palestinian scouts partake in the yearly Christmas procession towards the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem town in the Israel-occupied West Bank.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Christians gathered at the Church of the Nativity in the holy city of Bethlehem on Tuesday to mark a solemn Christmas overshadowed by war, as Pope Francis led mass in the Vatican.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Bethlehem, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, festive decorations were missing for a second consecutive year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd of several hundred paled in comparison to the throngs of tourists and pilgrims of Christmases past - a reflection of the sombre mood as the war between Israel and Hamas fighters in the Gaza Strip churns on.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Manger Square, the heart of the Palestinian city dominated by the revered church that marks the site where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born, a group of scouts held a parade that broke the morning's silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our children want to play and laugh," read a sign carried by one of them, as his friends whistled and cheered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traditionally in Bethlehem, a grand Christmas tree would light up Manger Square, but local authorities opted against elaborate celebrations for a second year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prayers, including the church's famed midnight mass, will still be held in the presence of the Catholic Church's Latin patriarch, but the festivities will be of a more strictly religious nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  The patriarch, Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, told a crowd in Bethlehem he had just returned from Gaza, where he "saw everything destroyed, poverty, disaster".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I also saw life. They don't give up. So you should not giver up either. Never."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the gloomy mood, some Christians in the Holy Land, who number about 185,000 in Israel and 47,000 in the Palestinian territories - were finding refuge in prayer.
  <br>
  <br>
  In war-ravaged Gaza, which is cut off from the West Bank by Israeli territory, hundreds of Christians gathered at a church to pray for an end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This Christmas carries the stench of death and destruction," said George al-Sayegh, who for weeks has sought refuge in the 12th-century Greek Orthodox Church of Saint Porphyrius in Gaza City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no joy, no festive spirit. We don't even know who will survive until the next holiday."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere in the Middle East, hundreds of people took to the streets in Christian areas of Damascus to protest the burning of a Christmas tree in a Syrian town, just over two weeks after Islamist-led rebels ousted president Bashar al-Assad. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American Airlines on Tuesday lifted an hour-long ground stop of all its flights in the US due to an unspecified technical issue, a notice on the U.S. aviation regulator's website showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ground stop, ahead of the busy Christmas travel, had threatened the holiday plans of thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A technical issue is affecting American flights this morning. Our teams are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, and we apologize to our customers for the inconvenience," the company had said in a statement following the ground stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  American operates thousands of flights per day to more than 350 destinations in more than 60 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of the carrier clawed back lost ground and were marginally down before the bell.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Federal Aviation Administration in a statement referred Reuters to the airline, reiterating that the carrier had reported a technical issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  American was responding to comments on X as numerous users posted there, as well as on Bluesky and Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hey, @AmericanAir just tell us whether we should go home or not. Please don't make us wait in the airport for hours," wrote one user.
  <br>
  <br>
  The grounding comes months after airlines were hit by a global tech outage tied to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and a software issue at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two years ago, Southwest Airlines experienced a meltdown with its systems during the holidays that led to 16,900 flight cancellations and stranded 2 million passengers. It was eventually fined US$140 million in the largest-ever civil penalty for a travel disruption. (Reuters)

 A powerful blast ripped through an explosives plant in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday killing 12 people and injuring four others, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Footage showed shards of glass and metal scattered outside the plant, where ambulances stood by.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to initial reports, 12 employees died and four were taken to hospital with injuries as a result of the explosion" in the Karesi district of Balikesir province, local governor Ismail Ustaoglu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the injured were not in a serious condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blast took place at 8.25am local time (0525 GMT) at a section of the plant which local officials said collapsed under the force of the explosion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the cause of the blast at the factory, which is located away from residential areas, was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are trying to find out what caused it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities ruled out sabotage and prosecutors have launched a thorough investigation.

    French PM: Mayotte death toll likely to be 'dozens'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou on Monday hit out at "alarmist" claims about a significant death toll from Cyclone Chido, which hit the country's Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I think that it'll be in the dozens and not in the thousands," he told BFMTV. "I think the alarmist and sometimes terrifying figures that have been put forward won't be borne out in reality."
  <br>
  <br>
  The official death toll from the cyclone that hit the impoverished islands earlier this month is at least 35, with some 2,500 injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a local official of the French territory on December 15 estimated that there were "certainly several hundred" victims, speculating that the death toll could rise to "several thousand".
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the storm battered the remote archipelago, rumours have circulated about possible mass graves in hard-to-reach areas still inaccessible to rescue teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doubts about the actual toll are linked to the makeshift dwellings where most potential victims lived as well as the Muslim tradition of burying the dead within 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many inhabitants of the flimsy shantytowns that were destroyed in the storm came from the neighbouring Comoros.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron visited Mayotte last Thursday and said the number of victims would "likely" exceed the first official tolls. (AFP)

<img alt="German President Steinmeier records his annual Christmas speech in Berlin. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784774_1_20241224082552.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's president said on Tuesday that a deadly car-ramming attack on a Christmas market had cast a "dark shadow" over this year's celebrations but urged the nation not to be driven apart by extremists.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his traditional Christmas address, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier sought to issue a message of healing four days after the brutal attack in the eastern city of Magdeburg killed five people and left over 200 wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dark shadow hangs over this Christmas," said the head of state, pointing to the "pain, horror and bewilderment over what happened in Magdeburg just a few days before Christmas".
  <br>
  <br>
  He made a call for national unity as a debate about security and immigration is flaring again: "Hatred and violence must not have the final word. Let's not allow ourselves to be driven apart. Let's stand together."
  <br>
  <br>
  His words came a day after the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) held what it called a memorial rally for the victims in Magdeburg, where one speaker demanded that Germany "must close the borders".
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearby, an anti-extremist initiative was held under the motto "Don't Give Hate a Chance".
  <br>
  <br>
  Steinmeier recognised that there was a "great deal of dissatisfaction about politics" in Germany but insisted that "our democracy is and remains strong".
  <br>
  <br>
  A Saudi doctor, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, 50, was arrested Friday at the scene of the attack in which a rented SUV ploughed at high speed through the crowd of revellers, bringing death and chaos to the festive event.
  <br>
  <br>
  His motive remains unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdulmohsen has in his many online posts voiced strongly anti-Islam views, anger at German authorities and support for far-right conspiracy narratives on the "Islamisation" of Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi suspect has been remanded in custody in a top-security facility on five counts of murder and 205 of attempted murder, prosecutors said, but not on terrorism-related charges. (AFP)

    Probe finds Trump ally paid for underage sex

<div class="itemFullText">
 A former US lawmaker who was Donald Trump's first pick to run the Justice Department paid for sex numerous times, including with an underage girl, according to a congressional report released Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Matt Gaetz also regularly used cocaine and ecstasy, and bought marijuana from his Capitol Hill office, according to the 37-page document, the culmination of a long-running probe by the House Ethics Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favours or privileges, and obstruction of Congress," panel investigators wrote, according to reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaetz has repeatedly denied wrongdoing - pointing to the Justice Department's decision not to bring charges against him in 2023 after a criminal probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report came out despite him suing the committee to block its release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congressional investigators found that the 42-year-old broke multiple Florida laws on sexual misconduct, although they cleared him of federal sex trafficking violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report listed payments by Gaetz totalling more than US$90,000 to 12 women "likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use" between 2017 and 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ex-congressman was a staunch Trump loyalist and a favourite of the president-elect's ardent supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  He resigned from Congress in November after Trump nominated him for US attorney general. (AFP)

 US President Joe Biden on Monday commuted the death sentences of 37 of 40 federal inmates, taking action ahead of the return of Donald Trump, who oversaw a sweeping number of lethal injections during his first term.
 <br>
  <br>
  "These commutations are consistent with the moratorium my Administration has imposed on federal executions, in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder," Biden said in a statement, announcing the prisoners would serve life in prison without the possibility of parole. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said on Sunday that weapons in the country, including those held by Kurdish-led forces, would come under state control.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa spoke alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, after earlier meeting with Lebanese Druze leaders and vowing to end "negative interference" in the neighbouring country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ankara-backed rebels played a key role in supporting Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which headed a rebel alliance that seized Damascus on December 8, toppling long-time ruler Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a press conference with Fidan, Sharaa said Syria's armed "factions will begin to announce their dissolution and enter" the army.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will absolutely not allow there to be weapons in the country outside state control, whether from the revolutionary factions or the factions present in the SDF area", he added, referring to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa also said "we are working on protecting sects and minorities from any attacks that occur between them" and from "external" actors exploiting the situation "to cause sectarian discord".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syria is a country for all and we can co-exist together," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's nearly 14-year civil war killed more than half-a-million people and displaced more than half its population, with many of them fleeing to neighbouring countries, including three million in Turkey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkey has maintained strong ties with Syria's new leaders, and has continued military operations against Kurdish-held areas in northeastern Syria. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A small plane carrying 10 people crashed into shops in the centre of the tourist city of Gramado in southern Brazil on Sunday, killing everyone on board, state government officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The aircraft's owner and pilot, Luiz Claudio Galeazzi, died along with the other nine passengers, all of whom were members of his family, according to Rio Grande do Sul Governor Eduardo Leite.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement published on LinkedIn, Galeazzi's company, Galeazzi & Associados, confirmed that the 61-year-old was on the plane, adding that he was traveling with his wife, their three daughters, several other family members and another company employee, who perished in the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, 17 people on the ground were injured, Leite said at a press conference, with 12 still receiving hospital care, including two in a critical condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manufactured in 1990, the twin-engine Piper PA-42-1000 took off shortly after 9 am local time from nearby Canela airport and was heading to Jundiai in Sao Paulo state under unfavourable weather conditions, the governor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the cause of the crash is being investigated by the Aeronautical Accident Investigation and Prevention Centre (Cenipa).
  <br>
  <br>
  Nestled in a mountainous region, Gramado is the most popular tourist destination in Rio Grande do Sul, which was severely impacted earlier this year by unprecedented floods that claimed dozens of lives, destroyed infrastructure and significantly disrupted the state's economy. (Agencies)

    Panama rejects Trump's threat to retake Panama Canal

Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784633_1_20241223090126.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panama's president Jose Raul Mulino on Sunday dismissed recent threats made by US President-elect Donald Trump to retake control of the Panama Canal over complaints of "unfair" treatment of American ships.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Every square metre of the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama," Mulino said in a video posted to social media platform, X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mulino's public comments, though never mentioning Trump by name, come a day after the president-elect complained about the canal on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal was completed by the United States in 1914 and returned to the Central American country under a 1977 deal signed by Democratic president Jimmy Carter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama took full control in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said if Panama could not ensure "the secure, efficient and reliable operation" of the channel, "then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mulino rejected Trump's claims in his video message, though he also said he hoped to have "a good and respectful relationship" with the incoming administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal has no direct or indirect control from China, nor the European Union, nor the United States or any other power," Mulino said. "As a Panamanian, I reject any manifestation that misrepresents this reality."
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Sunday, Trump responded to Mulino's dismissal, writing on Truth Social: "We'll see about that!" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of people streamed into a central square in Serbia's capital on Sunday for a rally against populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government, whose tight grip on power has been challenged by weeks of street protests led by university students.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rally at Belgrade's Slavija Square, one of the largest in recent years, was called by students and farmer unions. It was part of a wider movement demanding accountability over the November 1 collapse of a canopy at a railway station in the country's north that killed 15 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are all under the canopy,” read one of the banners displayed at the main Belgrade square.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smaller rallies were also held in the cities of Nis and Kragujevac. The protest in Belgrade started with a 15-minute silence for the victims. Later, chants of “You have blood on your hands!” were heard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in Serbia blame the collapse on widespread corruption and sloppy work on the railway station building in the city of Novi Sad.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a show of confidence, the Serbian president on Sunday inaugurated a section of a newly-built highway in central Serbia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vucic said he wouldn't budge to opposition demands for a transitional government and accused his opponents of using students to try to seize power.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will beat them again,” said Vucic. “They (the opposition) don't know what to do but to use someone's children.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In an apparent attempt to defuse the student-led protests, Vucic has been advertising what he said are “favourable” loans for young people to purchase apartments as well as attracting tens of thousands of doctors and other skilled people who have left the Balkan country for a better life in the West in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors have arrested 13 people over the Novi Sad tragedy, including a government minister whose release later fueled public scepticism about the honesty of the investigation. (AP)

<img alt="A man has been apprehended in connection with the death of a woman who was set on fire while she was on a stationary subway train in New York City.

<div class="itemFullText">
 New York City police announced on Sunday that they had in custody a “person of interest” in the early morning death of a woman who was lit on fire by a man she didn't know on a subway train.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police apprehended the suspect after receiving a report from three high school students, who had seen images of the suspect taken from surveillance and police body cam video.
  <br>
  <br>
  “New Yorkers came through again,” said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who described the case as “one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tisch said the suspect and the woman, both of whom have not been identified, were riding a subway train without any interaction between them to the end of the line in Brooklyn at around 7.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the train came to a stop, surveillance video from the carriage showed the man “calmly” walk up to the victim, who was seated motionless, possibly sleeping, and set her clothing on fire with what appeared to be a lighter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman's clothing then “became fully engulfed in a matter of seconds,” Tisch said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers on a routine patrol discovered the woman on fire, standing in the middle of the carriage. She was declared dead at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unbeknownst to the officers, the suspect was seated just outside the train car, on a bench on the platform, Tisch said. Body cameras worn by the officers caught a “very clear, detailed look” at the suspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man had a lighter in his pocket when he was taken into custody, Tisch said. (Reuters)

    Trump threatens to take back Panama Canal

<div class="itemFullText">
 Incoming US president Donald Trump on Saturday slammed what he called unfair fees for US ships passing through the Panama Canal and threatened to demand control of the waterway be returned to Washington.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also hinted at China's growing influence around the canal, a worrying trend for American interests as US businesses depend on the channel to move goods between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous," he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This complete 'rip-off' of our Country will immediately stop."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal, which was completed by the United States in 1914, was returned to the Central American country under a 1977 deal signed by Democratic president Jimmy Carter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama took full control in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else," Trump said. "We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!"
  <br>
  <br>
  He continued that if Panama could not ensure "the secure, efficient and reliable operation" of the channel, "then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in Panama did not immediately react to Trump's post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although he does not officially take office until next month, Trump has nevertheless been flexing his political influence in the waning days of President Joe Biden's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real estate mogul boasted on the campaign trail that as an entrepreneur, he was uniquely positioned to fight for US business interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  An estimated five percent of global maritime traffic passes through the Panama Canal, which allows ships traveling between Asia and the US East Coast to avoid the long, hazardous route around the southern tip of South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main users of the passage are the United States, China, Japan and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal Authority reported in October that the waterway had earned record revenues of nearly US$5 billion in the last fiscal year. (AFP)

    Putin vows 'destruction' after Kazan drone strike

<img alt="Videos on Russian social media networks showed drones hitting a high-rise glass building. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784590_1_20241222194935.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday vowed to bring more "destruction" to Ukraine in retaliation for a drone attack on the central Russian city of Kazan a day earlier.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russia accused Ukraine of a "massive" drone attack that hit a luxury apartment block in the city, some 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) from the frontier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos on Russian social media networks showed drones hitting a high-rise glass building and setting off fireballs, though there were no reported casualties as a result of the strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whoever, and however much they try to destroy, they will face many times more destruction themselves and will regret what they are trying to do in our country," Putin said during a televised government meeting on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin was addressing the local leader of Tatarstan, the region where Kazan is located, in a road-opening ceremony via video link.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike on Kazan was the latest in a series of escalating aerial attacks in the nearly three-year conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has not commented on the strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin has previously threatened to target the centre of Kyiv with a hypersonic ballistic missile in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the defence ministry has called Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities over recent weeks retaliatory hits for Kyiv using Western-supplied missiles to hit Russian air bases and arms factories.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest threat comes as Russia claimed fresh advances on the battlefield in east Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence ministry said on Telegram that its troops had "liberated" the villages of Lozova in the northeastern Kharkiv region and Krasnoye -- called Sontsivka in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter is close to the resource hub of Kurakhove, which Russia has almost encircled and would be a key prize in Moscow's attempt to capture the entire Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has accelerated its advance across eastern Ukraine in recent months, looking to secure as much territory as possible before US President-elect Donald Trump comes to power in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has promised to bring a swift end to the nearly three-year-long conflict, without proposing any concrete terms for a ceasefire or peace deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow's army claims to have seized more than 190 Ukrainian settlements this year, with Kyiv struggling to hold the line in the face of manpower and ammunition shortages. (AFP)

<img alt="Mark Burnett's biggest success was with " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784550_1_20241222074257.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday he has appointed television executive Mark Burnett, who produced the tycoon's reality show "The Apprentice", as special envoy to the United Kingdom, one of Washington's closest allies.
 <br>
  <br>
  "With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role," the Republican leader posted on his social media platform Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burnett's role will be different from that of ambassador and does not need US Senate confirmation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mark will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities and cultural exchanges," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early this month Trump nominated Warren Stephens, a top Republican donor and billionaire investment banker, to be US ambassador to Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Emmy Award-winning Burnett, who was born in London, is the creator of "Survivor", the reality competition series that became a US television juggernaut after its premiere in 2000. He has also produced other hit shows including "Shark Tank" and "The Voice".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also served as chairman of MGM Worldwide Television Group from 2018 to 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  His biggest success was with "The Apprentice", the American reality program that aired on NBC under various formats for 15 seasons beginning in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show was widely credited with reversing Trump's fortunes and making him a household name in the United States before he announced his presidential run in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'The Apprentice' mythologised him anew, and on a much bigger scale, turning him into an icon of American success," a profile of Burnett in The New Yorker magazine stated in 2018. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday visited the site of a car-ramming attack on a crowded Christmas market that killed five people and injured more than 200 as he called for unity while condemning the "terrible catastrophe."
 <br>
  <br>
  Police arrested a 50-year-old Saudi doctor of psychiatry at the scene, next to the battered BMW SUV that had ploughed through the festive crowd on Friday night, leaving a trail of carnage and bloodied casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sombre Scholz, dressed in black, was joined by national and regional politicians in the eastern city of Magdeburg, where they laid flowers outside the main church.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pledged that Germany would respond "with the full force of the law" to the attack but also called for unity as Germany has been rocked by a heated debate on immigration and security as it heads towards elections in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left chancellor said it was important "that we stick together, that we link arms, that it is not hatred that determines our coexistence but the fact that we are a community that seeks a common future."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was grateful for expressions of "solidarity ... from many, many countries around the world" and added that "it is good to hear that we as Germans are not alone in the face of this terrible catastrophe."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mourning and bereaved residents had already left candles, flowers and children's toys at the Johanneskirche church, where a memorial service was planned at 7:00 pm (1800 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  As Germany was reeling from the shocking attack, which came eight years after a jihadist strike on a Berlin Christmas market claimed 13 lives, more details emerged about the Saudi man under arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Named by German media as Taleb A, he was a doctor who had lived in Germany since 2006 and held a permanent residence permit, working in a clinic near Magdeburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had long also worked as a rights activist who supported Saudi women and described himself as a "Saudi atheist". He had voiced strongly anti-Islam views, echoing the rhetoric of the far-right, according to his social media posts and past interviews.
  <br>
  <br>
  As his views expressed online grew more radical, he accused Germany's past governments of a plan to "Islamise Europe" and voiced fears he was being targeted by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bild daily reported that an initial drug test had proved positive, after police officers on Friday used a test kit that can detect narcotics ranging from cannabis to cocaine and methamphetamines. (AFP)

 Ten people, including four children, have been killed in a stampede in Nigeria’s capital city as a large crowd gathered to collect food items distributed by a local church at a Christmas event, the police said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stampede occurred in the early morning hours at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Maitama, a high-brow part of Abuja, from where more than 1,000 people have been evacuated, police spokesman Josephine Adeh said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the second such stampede in a week in Africa’s most populous country as local organisations, churches and individuals are increasingly organising charity events ahead of Christmas amid the country’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cyclone Chido, which ravaged the French archipelago of Mayotte, has claimed 76 lives in Mozambique, the National Institute of Risk and Disaster Management said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chido made landfall in Mozambique on Sunday after tearing through the Indian Ocean island of Mayotte where hundreds of people are feared to have been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cyclone struck Mozambique in northern Cabo Delgado province and destroyed nearly 62,000 homes, according to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shelter, food and Non-food items (NFIs) - particularly hygiene kits, dignity kits, soap and mosquito nets are identified as being the most urgent needs for the affected population," the International Organisation for Migration said in a statement. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Thai national was sentenced to death and two Germans were handed life sentences for the gruesome murder of a German real estate broker near the resort town of Pattaya, Thai media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Pattaya Provincial Court delivered the death sentence to Shahrukh Karim Uddin, a Thai of Pakistani descent, on Friday for the murder of Peter Ralter Mack, 62, in July 2023, the Bangkok Post newspaper reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mack's dismembered body was found inside a freezer covered in a thick layer of tape at a residence in an outer Pattaya suburb in southern Thailand's Chonburi province.
  <br>
  <br>
  German nationals Olaf Thorsten Brinkmann and Petra Christl Grundgreif confessed to the crime during the trial and their sentences were reduced from capital punishment to life in prison as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three defendants were found guilty of premeditated murder and concealing a body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mack disappeared after telling his wife he was meeting another property realtor, although his family later believed he had been lured away and kidnapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard evidence that the group planned to dispose of Mack's body at sea and transferred 3.35 million baht (US$98,000) out of his bank account. (AFP)

    Thousands celebrate winter solstice at Stonehenge

<img alt="Research suggests Stonehenge may have had political as well as spiritual significance. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784513_1_20241221183146.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of tourists, pagans, druids and people simply yearning for the promise of spring marked the dawn of the shortest day of the year at the ancient Stonehenge monument on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Revellers cheered and beat drums as the sun rose at 8:09 am (0809 GMT) over the giant standing stones on the winter solstice – the shortest day and the longest night in the Northern Hemisphere. No one could see the sun through the low winter cloud, but that did not deter a flurry of drumming, chanting and singing as dawn broke.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be less than eight hours of daylight in England on Saturday – but after that, the days get longer until the summer solstice in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The solstices are the only occasions when visitors can go right up to the stones at Stonehenge, and thousands are willing to rise before dawn to soak up the atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stone circle, whose giant pillars each took 1,000 people to move, was erected starting about 5,000 years ago by a sun-worshipping Neolithic culture. Its full purpose is still debated: Was it a temple, a solar calculator, a cemetery, or some combination of all three?
  <br>
  <br>
  In a paper published in the journal Archaeology International, researchers from University College London and Aberystwyth University said the site on Salisbury Plain, about 128 kilometres southwest of London, may have had political as well as spiritual significance.
  <br>
  <br>
  That follows from the recent discovery that one of Stonehenge’s stones – the unique stone lying flat at the centre of the monument, dubbed the “altar stone” – originated in Scotland, hundreds of miles north of the site. Some of the other stones were brought from the Preseli Hills in southwest Wales, nearly 240 kilometres to the west,
  <br>
  <br>
  Lead author Mike Parker Pearson from UCL’s Institute of Archaeology said the geographical diversity suggests Stonehenge may have served as a "monument of unification for the peoples of Britain, celebrating their eternal links with their ancestors and the cosmos." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Pakistani Taliban claimed a brazen overnight raid on an army outpost near the border with Afghanistan on Saturday, which intelligence officials said killed 16 soldiers and critically wounded five more.
 <br>
  <br>
  The siege started after midnight and lasted about two hours as around 30 militants pummelled the mountainous outpost from three sides, one senior intelligence official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sixteen soldiers were martyred and five were critically injured in the assault," he said. "The militants set fire to the wireless communication equipment, documents and other items present at the checkpoint."
  <br>
  <br>
  A second intelligence official also anonymously confirmed the toll of dead and wounded in the attack in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 40 kilometres from the Afghan border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan's domestic chapter of the Taliban claimed the attack in a statement, saying it was staged "in retaliation for the martyrdom of our senior commanders."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group claimed to have seized a hoard of military gear including machine guns and a night vision device.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan's military has not yet issued a statement on the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan has been battling a resurgence of militant violence in its western border regions since the Taliban's 2021 return to power in Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Islamabad accuses Kabul's rulers of failing to root out militants staging attacks on Pakistan from over the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pakistani Taliban – known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) – share a common ideology with their Afghan counterparts who surged back to power three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kabul's new rulers have pledged to evict foreign militant groups from Afghan soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a UN Security Council report in July estimated up to 6,500 TTP fighters are based there – and said "the Taliban do not conceive of TTP as a terrorist group."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said the Afghan Taliban show "ad hoc support to, and tolerance of, TTP operations, including the supplying of weapons and permission for training."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spike in attacks has soured Islamabad-Kabul relations. Security was cited as one reason for Pakistan's campaign last year to evict hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghan migrants. (AFP)

 A projectile fired from Yemen struck Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv early on Saturday, wounding 16 people, the military and emergency service providers said, the second such attack within days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said it had failed to intercept the projectile, which struck a district of Tel Aviv municipality, forcing many residents to leave their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yemen's Houthi rebels later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it used a ballistic missile and was directed at "a military target of the Israeli enemy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Iranian-backed Houthis have repeatedly launched missile attacks against Israel in solidarity with Palestinians since the war in Gaza began more than a year ago, most of which have been intercepted.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, Israel has struck multiple targets in Yemen, including ports and energy facilities in areas controlled by the Huthis. (AFP)

    Indian denies hospital rape and murder of doctor

<img alt="Tens of thousands of ordinary Indians joined doctors in protests after the brutal attack. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784491_1_20241221151438.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian man on trial for raping and murdering a 31-year-old doctor has pleaded not guilty, his lawyer said on Saturday, a crime that appalled the nation and triggered wide-scale protests.
 <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the doctor's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata on August 9 sparked nationwide anger at the chronic issue of violence against women.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanjoy Roy, 33, the lone accused in the case, pleaded not guilty before the judge in a closed court on Friday in Kolkata, his lawyer Sourav Bandyopadhyay said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am not guilty, your honour, I have been framed," Roy told the court, Bandyopadhyay said, repeating his client's words.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy, a civic volunteer in the hospital, was arrested the day after the murder and has been held in custody since.
  <br>
  <br>
  He would potentially face the death penalty if convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court began hearings on November 11, listening to evidence from some 50 witnesses, but it was on Friday that Roy took the stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Judge Anirban Das questioned him with more than 100 questions during the six-hour-long on-camera deposition, that continued until late in the evening," Bandyopadhyay said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy had earlier proclaimed his innocence to the public while screaming from a prison van outside the court before a hearing in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doctors in Kolkata went on strike for weeks in response to the brutal attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tens of thousands of ordinary Indians joined in the protests, which focused anger on the lack of measures for female doctors to work without fear.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court has ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the brutality of the killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The gruesome nature of the attack drew comparisons with the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, which also sparked weeks of nationwide protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial continues. The next hearing is set for January 2, 2025. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German police arrested a Saudi Arabian man after a deadly car-ramming attack on a Christmas market Friday in which an SUV barrelled through a crowd of revellers at high speed, leaving a trail of bloody carnage.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least two people were killed, one of them a young child, and 68 injured, said authorities in the city of Magdeburg, located about 130 kilometres (80 miles) southwest of Berlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect was a 50-year-old medical doctor from Saudi Arabia living in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, said regional premier Reiner Haseloff, speaking at a scene cordoned off and guarded by police commandos.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have arrested the perpetrator, a man from Saudi Arabia, a doctor who has been in Germany since 2006," he told reporters, calling the attack a "catastrophe" for the city and the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From what we currently know he was a lone attacker so we don't think there is any further danger."
  <br>
  <br>
  German media partially named the suspect as Taleb A. and said he was a doctor of psychiatry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The black BMW barrelled through the crowd at high speed just after 7:00 pm local time (1800 GMT) when the market was filled with revellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage showed the driver's arrest as police with their handguns trained shouted "lie down, hands on your back, don't move!" at the bearded man with glasses who was lying on the ground next to the heavily damaged car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the vehicle drove "at least 400 metres across the Christmas market" leaving a trail of bloodied casualties, debris and broken glass at the city's central town hall square.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the chaotic site, which was doused in blue police lights and wailing sirens, as badly injured people were treated on site and rushed off to hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cries and screams rang out as around 100 emergency responders deployed to the litter-strewn market decorated with Christmas trees and festive lights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pictures are terrible," said city spokesman Michael Reif.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadly carnage recalled a 2016 jihadist attack in which a Tunisian man driving a lorry killed 12 people in a Christmas market in Berlin, the country's worst such attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 13th victim died later having suffered serious injuries in the assault, claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.
  <br>
  <br>
  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote on X that "the reports from Magdeburg raise the worst fears".
  <br>
  <br>
  "My thoughts are with the victims and their families. We stand by their side and by the side of the people of Magdeburg. My thanks go to the dedicated rescue workers in these anxious hours."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz was expected to travel to the city on Saturday, said the state premier.
  <br>
  <br>
  German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has recently called on people to be vigilant at Christmas markets, although she said that authorities had not received any specific threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The domestic security service had warned it considers Christmas markets to be an "ideologically suitable target for Islamist-motivated people". (AFP)

    Congress passes funding bill with Democrat help

<img alt="US president-elect Donald Trump has made it clear he's willing to see a shutdown if he does not get his way on the spending package. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784460_1_20241221090155.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US House of Representatives voted on Friday to avert a government shutdown with just hours to spare, with Democrats joining Republicans to advance a funding bill keeping the lights on through mid-March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers sent a package to the Senate that would keep federal agencies running through mid-March -- but the upper chamber only has until midnight (0500 GMT) to follow suit or federal agencies will begin shutting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the House is run by the Republicans, who introduced the bill, 34 of the party's backbenchers voted against it, while almost every Democrat was a yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, Democrats stood firm in our commitment to collaboration, not division. The American people deserve a government that works for them," senior Democratic Congressman Bennie Thompson posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  If senators drag their feet, the government will still cease to be funded at midnight, and non-essential operations will start to grind to a halt, with up to 875,000 workers furloughed and 1.4 million more required to work without pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic-led upper chamber would be expected to follow the House, however, and the main question now is how quickly senators will move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congress's setting of government budgets is always a fraught task, with both chambers closely divided between Republicans and Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest drama intensified after Republican President-elect Trump and tech billionaire Musk, his incoming "efficiency czar," pressured his party to renege on a funding bill they had hammered out with Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two subsequent efforts to find compromise fell short, leaving Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson at the last chance saloon as he huddled with aides to keep government agencies running.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the bill fails Senate scrutiny, non-essential government functions will be put on ice. Employees in key services like law enforcement would continue working but would only be paid once government functions are back up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many parks, monuments and national sites would close at a time when millions of visitors are expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The House-passed bill avoids all that by funding the government until mid-March in a package that includes IS$110 billion in disaster aid and financial relief for farmers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is essentially the same as a bill that failed miserably in a vote on Thursday -- except without a two-year suspension of the country's self-imposed borrowing limit demanded by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk appeared again to be doing his best to marshal conservatives against the deal ahead of the House vote, as he posted: "So is this a Republican bill or a Democrat bill?"
  <br>
  <br>
  The influence of the world's richest man over the Republicans -- and his apparent sway with Trump -- has become a focus for Democratic attack, with questions raised over how an unelected citizen can wield so much power.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is growing anger even among Republicans over Musk's interference after he trashed the original funding agreement in a blizzard of posts -- many of them wildly inaccurate -- on his social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last time I checked, Elon Musk doesn't have a vote in Congress," Georgia House Republican Rich McCormick told CNN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, he has influence, and he'll put pressure on us to do whatever he thinks the right thing is for him. But I have 760,000 people that voted for me to do the right thing for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate's expected rubber stamp could take days under the rules governing the upper chamber, unless members agree unanimously to waive normal procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has been clear that he is willing to see a shutdown if he does not get his way. (AFP)

 US President-elect Donald Trump on Friday threatened the European Union with tariffs if the bloc does not reduce its "tremendous" trade gap with Washington through oil and gas purchases.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large-scale purchase of our oil and gas," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform in the early hours of Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!"
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US figures, goods imports from the EU were US$553.3 billion in 2022, while its exports to the bloc were US$350.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  This puts the US goods trade deficit with the EU at US$202.5 billion that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU chief Ursula von der Leyen had already suggested to Trump in November that the United States could supply more liquefied natural gas to the bloc to replace Russian energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Replying to questions on Trump's threat on Friday, an EU spokesman said the 27-nation bloc was open to talks, noting that the US also enjoyed "a substantial trade in services surplus vis a vis the EU."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to discuss with President-elect Trump how we can further strengthen an already strong relationship, including by discussing our common interests in the energy sector," EU spokesman Olof Gill told a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who takes office in January, has made sweeping threats of slapping tariffs on US trading partners – including Canada, Mexico and China – which could send reverberations across the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accusing Canada and Mexico of allowing the United States to be flooded with illicit drugs and undocumented migrants, he had threatened a 25-percent import tariff, while vowing at least 10 percent against Chinal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, the European Union concluded a massive trade deal with four South American countries – Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – which aims to create a 700-million-customer free-trade area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Von der Leyen had said the agreement would build trade bridges as "strong winds are blowing in the opposite direction, towards isolation and fragmentation" – comments largely seen as a nod to Trump's threats to hike tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts have said Trump's tariff threats could be bluster, or an opening shot for leverage in future trade negotiations when he comes into office.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump has continually insisted that "properly used" tariffs would be positive for the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country right now loses to everybody," he told reporters at his Florida residence earlier this week. "Tariffs will make our country rich." (AFP)
