<div class="itemFullText">
 A massive drone strike rattled Moscow and its suburbs overnight into Sunday, injuring a woman and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia's busiest airports, while a huge nighttime wave of Russian drones targeted Ukraine, officials reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  A top UK defence official meanwhile said that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since their full-scale assault on Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief of the UK defence staff, Tony Radakin, said Moscow’s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded “every single day,” bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's defence ministry said a total of 70 drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, including 34 over Moscow's outskirts. Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman in her 50s suffered burns to her face, neck and hands after drones sparked a blaze in her village southeast of Moscow, local Governor Andrei Vorobyov reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt in Moscow itself, according to Sobyanin, although Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying “an extraordinary price" for the war, even as a gruelling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine's industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how UK officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the losses were for “tiny increments of land,” and that Moscow's mounting defence and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Radakin insisted that Ukraine's Western partners should stand by it for “as long as it takes” to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of US President-elect Donald Trump have signalled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following “human wave” attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Russia overnight launched a “record” 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine’s air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were “lost”, the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa, local Governor Oleh Kiper reported. (AP)

    Dozens dead in Israeli strikes on Gaza, Lebanon

<img alt="The first strike early on Sunday completely demolished a house in Jabalia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778426_1_20241110192106.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched deadly strikes on Gaza and Lebanon on Sunday, rescuers and authorities said, ahead of a US deadline for improved aid delivery to the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers in Gaza on Sunday said 30 people, including 13 children, were killed by Israeli strikes in the territory's north.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first strike early on Sunday hit a house in Jabalia, killing "at least 25" people including 13 children and injuring more than 30, the Palestinian territory's civil defence agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vowing to stop Hamas militants from regrouping in north Gaza, Israel on October 6 began a major air and ground assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations has described the area as under "siege" and Washington set a deadline of this coming week for Israel to get more aid in or face possible cuts to military assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strike on the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City killed five people, with others still missing, the civil defence agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A number of civilians are still under the rubble," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said it was "looking into the reports" of the strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon's health ministry, meanwhile, said an Israeli strike on the village of Almat north of Beirut killed at least 20 people including three children on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war in Gaza erupted with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,603 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which the UN considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since late September Israel has been engaged in a two-front war after turning its focus north toward Lebanon, escalating air strikes and sending in ground troops, after almost a year of tit-for-tat exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah. The Lebanese group said it was acting in support of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's main military backer the United States on October 15 warned that it could withhold some of its billions of dollars in military assistance unless Israel improves aid delivery to the Gaza Strip within 30 days – a deadline that expires on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at the time that top US officials made "clear to the government of Israel that there are changes that they need to make again to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up from the very, very low levels that it is at today."
  <br>
  <br>
  The demand came before Tuesday's election of President-elect Donald Trump who has promised to give freer rein to Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday a UN-backed assessment warned famine is imminent in northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid shipments allowed to enter Gaza were now lower than at any time since October 2023, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alert from the Famine Review Committee warned of "an imminent and substantial likelihood of famine occurring, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military questioned the report's credibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To date, all assessments by the IPC have proven incorrect and inconsistent with the situation on the ground," a military statement said, denouncing "partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests."
  <br>
  <br>
  IPC says its process is "evidence-based" and ensures "a rigorous, neutral analysis."
  <br>
  <br>
  The heads of UN agencies in early November described north Gaza as "under siege" and denied "basic aid and life-saving supplies."
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken hopes to use the remaining weeks of his term to press for an end to the Gaza and Lebanon wars, a spokesman said on Thursday, before fellow mediator Qatar on Saturday said it had suspended its role in trying to broker a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Qatar would resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness," Doha's foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said in a statement. (AFP)

    King Charles leads silence for UK war dead

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 King Charles led Britain in two minutes of silence on Sunday to honour the country's war dead at a remembrance service also attended by Catherine, Princess of Wales, as she returns to royal duties after cancer treatment.
 <br>
  <br>
  The king, who was also diagnosed with cancer this year, was among the dignitaries to lay wreaths at the Cenotaph memorial in central London after the nation fell silent at 11:00 am (1100 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds lined the Whitehall area of the capital as political leaders including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, current and former members of the armed forces, and war veterans paid their respects to Britons killed in the world wars and other conflicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Catherine, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, watched the ceremony from a government building balcony as she stepped up her return to royal duties since ending chemotherapy in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event came after she smiled and clapped alongside her husband Prince William at the Festival of Remembrance commemorative concert on Saturday night, the first major royal occasion she had attended since her treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The events, two of the most important dates in the royal calendar, marked the first time the princess had carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buckingham Palace announced in February that Charles, 75, had been diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer and would withdraw from public life to undergo treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The following month Kate, 42, revealed that she also had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both have since made limited returns to public duties, with Charles recently pausing his treatment while on tour in Australia and Samoa.
  <br>
  <br>
  William said this week that the past year had been "brutal" and probably the "hardest" of his life because of the twin diagnoses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, it's been dreadful," he told reporters on Thursday at the end of a four-day visit to South Africa for his Earthshot prize initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult."
  <br>
  <br>

    Philippines to evacuate 2,500 villages ahead of Toraji

<img alt="Severe Tropical Storm Toraji is set to batter parts of the Philippines still reeling from the devastation caused by three huge storms in less than a month. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778429_1_20241110194929.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The residents of 2,500 villages were ordered to evacuate their homes as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji approached the northern Philippines, the government said on Sunday, after three massive cyclones battered the country in less than a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 700,000 people are still sheltering at evacuation centres or with relatives after their homes were destroyed by tropical cyclones Trami, Kong-rey and Yinxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous trio of storms killed 159 people and with Toraji due to make landfall on Monday, people living in 2,500 villages across the northern regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley and Cordillera have been ordered to evacuate, Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The soil in those areas is now very saturated and the risk of landslides is very high," Remulla said in a briefing on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot stress it enough, the evacuation orders are important."
  <br>
  <br>
  Toraji, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 110 kilometres per hour, was expected to unleash torrential rains and strong winds when it makes landfall over the northern provinces of Aurora or Isabela, the state weather agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military and police have also prepositioned at least 14 aircraft for rescue and transportation of food in areas that could be isolated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sea travel has also been suspended and dams have started to release water in advance to prevent flooding, Remulla said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toraji's approach has complicated recovery efforts from the three previous storms.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Typhoon Yinxing slammed into the country's north coast. It left a 12-year-old girl dead and damaged houses and buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 51,000 people are still displaced in badly-hit Cagayan province north of Manila, with at least seven of its towns still without power, the provincial disaster agency said in a report on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks before that, Severe Tropical Storm Trami and Super Typhoon Kong-rey together left 158 people dead, the national disaster agency said, with most of that tally attributed to Trami.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has won the presidential election in Arizona, Edison Research projected on Saturday, completing a sweep of all seven battleground states and locking in a decisive Electoral College victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
 <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump, who had secured the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House by early on Wednesday, now has what is expected to be a final total of 312 votes to Harris' 226.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to Arizona, Trump won the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada. In 2020, Biden defeated Trump by winning six of the seven swing states - and narrowly lost North Carolina, winning 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also won 306 in his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump won 74.6 million votes nationwide, or 50.5 percent, to Harris' 70.9 million, or 48 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Congress certifies the Electoral College vote on January 6, Trump and his incoming vice president, US Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on January 20. (AP)

    Famine looming in north Gaza: UN-backed report

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Famine is looming in the northern Gaza Strip amid increased hostilities and a near-halt in food aid, a UN-backed assessment said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The alert from the Famine Review Committee warned of "an imminent and substantial likelihood of famine occurring, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Famine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future," said the alert.
  <br>
  <br>
  On October 17, the body projected that the number of people in Gaza facing "catastrophic" food insecurity between November and April 2025 would reach 345,000, or 16 percent of the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report classified that as IPC Phase 5 – a situation when "starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels are evident."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since that report, conditions have worsened in the north of Gaza, with a collapse of food systems, a drop in humanitarian aid and critical water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, the committee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It can therefore be assumed that starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing in these areas," it read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vast areas of the Gaza Strip have been devastated by Israel's retaliatory assault launched after the October 7 attack last year by Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces have intensified their operations in large swathes of the Gaza Strip's north since early October, where evacuation orders are in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid shipments allowed to enter the Gaza Strip were now lower than at any time since October 2023, said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Access to food continues to deteriorate, with prices of essentials on the black market soaring. Cooking gas rose by 2,612 percent, diesel by 1,315 percent and wood by 250 percent, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Concurrent with the extremely high and increasing prices of essential items has been the total collapse of livelihoods to be able to purchase or barter for food and other basic needs," said the alert.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body expressed concern over Israel's cutting ties last month with the UN aid agency for Palestinians (UNRWA), warning of "extremely serious consequences for humanitarian operations" in Gaza. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Devastating flooding in South Sudan is affecting around 1.4 million people, with more than 379,000 displaced, according to a United Nations update that warned about an upsurge in malaria.
 <br>
  <br>
  Aid agencies have said that the world's youngest country, highly vulnerable to climate change, is in the grip of its worst flooding in decades, mainly in the north.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said about 1.4 million people were affected by floods in 43 counties and the disputed Abyei region, which is claimed by both South Sudan and Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over 379,000 individuals are displaced in 22 counties and Abyei," it added in a statement issued late on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A surge in malaria has been reported in several states, it said, "overwhelming the health system and exacerbating the situation and impact in flood-hit areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, the world's youngest nation has remained plagued by chronic instability, violence and economic stagnation as well as climate disasters such as drought and floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Bank said last month that the latest floods were "worsening an already critical humanitarian situation marked by severe food insecurity, economic decline, continued conflict, disease outbreaks, and the repercussions of the Sudan conflict," which has seen several hundred thousand people pour into South Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than seven million people are food insecure in South Sudan and 1.65 million children are malnourished, according to the UN's World Food Programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country also faces another period of political paralysis after the president's office announced in September yet another extension to a transitional period agreed in a 2018 peace deal, delaying elections by two years to December 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key provisions of the transitional agreement remain unfulfilled – including the creation of a constitution and the unification of the rival forces of President Salva Kiir and his foe Reik Machar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delay has left South Sudan's partners and the United Nations exasperated, with UN envoy Nicholas Haysom on Thursday describing it as a "regrettable development."
  <br>
  <br>
  All local and international parties involved "must collectively seize the opportunity to make this extension the last, and deliver the peace and democracy that the people of South Sudan deserve," added Haysom.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Sudan boasts plentiful oil resources but the vital source of revenue was decimated in February when an export pipeline was damaged in neighbouring war-torn Sudan. (AFP)

    Rome's Trevi Fountain opens temporary tourist catwalk

<img alt="For the time being at least, people can view the famous architecture from a completely different perspective. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778343_1_20241109213345.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A suspended walkway providing tourists an up-close view of Rome's Trevi Fountain was unveiled on Saturday, a temporary addition while the famous "La Dolce Vita" site undergoes cleaning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Baroque masterpiece constructed on the facade of a palace is one of the most popular sites in Rome for tourists, who strain over the crowds to throw their coins into its water.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the fountain is being cleaned to remove limestone deposits and grime, however, the walkway positioned over its basin will accommodate some 130 people at a time to take a closer look.
  <br>
  <br>
  That will give tourists "an experience not ruined by excessive crowding," said Rome's mayor, Roberto Gualtieri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wanted to give everybody the opportunity to admire the fountain and to do this from a unique perspective, because what you can see from the walkway, you will never be able to see normally," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  French tourist Franc Petretto, 50, was one of the first to walk across the passageway, calling the view "wonderful and very, very beautiful."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even without the water flowing inside the fountain, you can really see that the architecture is serious... and that's really very pleasing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Micaela di Caterina, a 32-year-old visiting from Argentina, agreed, saying the up-close look at the intricate sculptures of Oceanus, father of the river gods, and his sea-horses was "incredible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, she acknowledged, it was "kind of weird" to be walking over the fountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fountain – where Anita Ekberg frolicked in Federico Fellini's 1960 film "La Dolce Vita" – last got a thorough scrub a decade ago during an 18-month renovation sponsored by Fendi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, too, the Italian fashion house installed a plexiglass bridge above the basin allowing tourists to still admire the fountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The current work involves removing limestone deposits on the fountain's facade, which can turn black with time, while removing loose material between stones where vegetation grows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists won't be allowed to toss coins over their shoulders into the fountain's basin – where tradition has it that visitors who do so will return to Rome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, a small pool set up next to the walkway has been installed to receive spare change.
  <br>
  <br>
  That pool "allows us to avoid throwing coins, which, without water, would damage the fountain," Gualtieri said, adding that anyone doing so would be fined.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also allows the flow of donations to Rome's needy to continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Every week, authorities recuperated some 10,000 euros in coins from Trevi Fountain, which were donated to the Caritas charity to fund meals, said Gaultieri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proud not to have interrupted such important work for those in difficulty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The walkway will be up until the cleaning is complete, sometime in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaultieri said city officials were still considering a possible ticketing system to control the crowds at Trevi Fountain once the cleaning is over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor numbers are expected to surge next year for the Jubilee, a holy year held by the Catholic Church around once every 25 years, with some 30 million people expected in Rome and the Vatican. (AFP)

    Gaza rescuers say 14 killed in Israeli strikes

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday that Israeli air strikes killed at least 14 Palestinians overnight, including women and children, while the Israeli military said it had eliminated dozens of militants in the territory's north.
 <br>
  <br>
  An air strike hit tents housing displaced Palestinians in the southern area of Khan Younis, killing at least nine people, including children and women, said civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Red Crescent also confirmed the toll, saying 11 others were wounded in the strike and were taken to Nasser Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second air strike killed five people, including children, and injured about 22 when "Israeli warplanes hit Fahad Al-Sabah school," which had been turned into a shelter for "thousands of displaced people" in the Al-Tuffah district of Gaza City, Bassal said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dead and injured were taken to Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent months, the military has struck several schools-turned-shelters where Israel has said Palestinian militants are operating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Israeli military said its troops killed "dozens of terrorists" in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, where it has been conducting a sweeping air and ground operation for more than a month to prevent Hamas from regrouping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces also killed several militants in the area of Rafah in the territory's south, the military added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military is currently engaged in a two-front war, with troops fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past day, the IAF (air force) struck over 50 terror targets in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip," the military said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the targets struck were military structures, weapons storage facilities and launchers," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's war in Gaza broke out after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7 last year, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people on Israeli side, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures, which included those who died and were killed in captivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the attack, militants abducted 251 people, 97 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 43,508 people, a majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

    Pakistani separatists kill 26 in railway station blast

<img alt="The huge blast was aimed at military personnel waiting on the platform at Quetta station. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778329_1_20241109185345.jpg&q=35">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A bombing claimed by Pakistani separatists killed 26 people including 14 soldiers at a railway station in the southwestern Balochistan province, a hospital spokesman said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blast hit as passengers waited on a platform at the main railway station in the provincial capital Quetta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fourteen members of the army and 12 civilians were killed," said Wasim Baig, spokesman for Quetta's Sandeman Provincial Hospital, raising an earlier toll of 25 provided by police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty-six members of the security forces and 14 civilians were wounded, the spokesman added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Journalists saw pools of blood and ripped backpacks at the scene, where a large metal sheet protecting passengers from the elements had been blown off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite frequent attacks in Balochistan the toll of Saturday's blast was particularly high for the southwestern province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The train station explosion hit at around 8:45 am (0345 GMT) and was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), one of the area's main separatist groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack "was carried out on a Pakistani army unit at Quetta railway station... after completing a course at the Infantry School," the BLA said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Associated Press of Pakistan, the official news agency, cited railway officials as saying the blast happened near the ticket booth when two trains were scheduled to depart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the attackers "will pay a heavy price," according to a statement from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BLA frequently claims deadly attacks against security forces or Pakistanis from other provinces, notably Punjabis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Quetta station, police said they were working to determine the cause of the blast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we reached here, initially it appeared that some explosive had perhaps been hidden or left in the luggage. But now we think it may be a suicide bomber," Muhammad Baloch, a senior local police official, told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters, rescuers and passengers were working through abandoned luggage on the platform, guarded by heavily armed members of the security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Militants have in the past targeted energy projects with foreign financing, accusing outsiders of exploiting the resource-rich region while excluding residents in the poorest part of Pakistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August, the BLA claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks by dozens of assailants who killed at least 39 people, one of the highest tolls to hit the region. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Global food prices rose in October to their highest level in 18 months, with a sharp increase in the cost of vegetable oil, the Food and Agriculture Organisation said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks monthly changes in international prices of a basket of food commodities, reached 127.4 points last month, a two-percent increase from September.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the highest since April 2023 but still 20.5 percent lower than the peak reached in March 2022 following Russia's assault on agricultural powerhouse Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vegetable oil prices increased by 7.3 percent in October, reaching a two-year high due to lower production.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sugar prices rose 2.6 percent, dairy was up 2.5 percent and cereals gained 0.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meat was the only commodity to fall, down 0.3 percent from the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAO is an agency of the United Nations. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Nations League football match between France and Israel will go ahead as planned in Paris next week despite the clashes that erupted in Amsterdam following a game between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax, the French interior minister said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The game at the Stade de France on Thursday has been identified as a potential flashpoint but Bruno Retailleau said France would not "back down."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some are calling for the France-Israel match to be relocated. I do not accept this," Retailleau wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "France is not backing down because that would amount to giving up in the face of threats of violence and anti-Semitism," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retailleau said he had asked Paris police chief Laurent Nunez to take the necessary security measures for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawmaker from Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) party, Julien Odoul, on Thursday suggested moving the match to the island of Corsica.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violence flared in Amsterdam after a Europa League match on Thursday between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli, Dutch and European leaders on Friday condemned the "anti-Semitic" clashes and Israel sent rescue planes for its citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Amsterdam Femke Halsema said the violence represented an "explosion" of anti-Semitism that has "not been seen in a long time," describing "hit and run" attacks on Maccabi supporters by "hooligans on scooters." (AFP)

    Majority of Gaza war dead women, children: UN probe

<img alt="The UN human rights office says about 80 percent of all the verified deaths in Gaza had occurred in Israeli attacks on residential buildings or similar housing. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778223_1_20241108220743.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN on Friday condemned the staggering number of civilians killed in Israel's war in Gaza, with women and children comprising nearly 70 percent of the thousands of fatalities it had managed to verify.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a fresh report, slammed by Israel, the United Nations human rights office (OHCHR) detailed a raft of violations of international law since Hamas's deadly October 7 attack in Israel sparked the war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many could amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and possibly even "genocide," it warned, demanding international efforts to prevent "atrocity crimes" and ensure accountability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Civilians in Gaza have borne the brunt of the attacks, including through the initial 'complete siege' of Gaza by Israeli forces," the UN said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Conduct by Israeli forces has caused unprecedented levels of killings, death, injury, starvation, illness and disease."
  <br>
  <br>
  It pointed to "the Israeli government's continuing unlawful failures to allow, facilitate and ensure the entry of humanitarian aid, the destruction of civilian infrastructure, and repeated mass displacement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva "categorically" rejected the report, decrying "the inherent obsession of OHCHR with the demonisation of Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Gaza is now a rubble-strewn landscape," Ajith Sunghay, head of the UN rights office's activities in the Palestinian territories, said via video-link from Amman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Within this dystopia of destruction and devastation, those alive are left injured, displaced and starving."
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's report also found that Hamas and other armed groups had committed widespread violations that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including seizing hostages, killings, torture and sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those violations, it said, were especially committed in connection with the October 7, 2023 attack, which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly of civilians, according to a tally of official Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also tackled the contentious issue of the proportion of civilians among the nearly 43,500 people killed in Gaza so far, according to the health ministry in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN agencies have been relying on death tolls provided by the authorities in Hamas-run Gaza due to lack of access. This has sparked harsh criticism from Israel but the UN has repeatedly said the figures are reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rights office said it had now managed to verify around 10,000 of the more than 34,500 people reportedly killed during the first six months of the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so far found close to 70 percent to be children and women," Sunghay said, highlighting the stringent verification methodology that requires at least three separate sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the findings indicated "a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 4,700 of the verified fatalities were children and 2,461 were women.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rights office found that about 80 percent of all the verified deaths in Gaza had occurred in Israeli attacks on residential buildings or similar housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children between the ages of five and nine made up the largest group of victims, with the youngest victim a one-day-old boy and the oldest a 97-year-old woman, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel says its operations in Gaza target militants and are in line with international law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Friday's report stressed that the verified deaths largely Gaza's demographic makeup rather than that of combatants.
  <br>
  <br>
  This, it said, clearly "raises concerns regarding compliance with the principle of distinction and reflect an apparent failure to take all feasible precautions to avoid, and in any event to minimise, incidental loss of civilian life."
  <br>
  <br>
  UN rights chief Volker Turk called on all countries to work to halt the violations and to ensure accountability, including through universal jurisdiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is essential that there is due reckoning with respect to the allegations of serious violations of international law through credible and impartial judicial bodies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The violence must stop immediately, the hostages and those arbitrarily detained must be released, and we must focus on flooding Gaza with humanitarian aid." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The mayor of Amsterdam on Friday announced tighter security measures in the city after five people were hospitalised and 62 arrested as a result of clashes that erupted in Amsterdam overnight following a football match.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Several reports about last night's events in Amsterdam are circulating on social media," the city’s police said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police have launched a major investigation into multiple violent incidents," it said, adding that “the police are aware of reports regarding a possible hostage situation and missing persons but currently have no confirmation that this actually took place. This aspect is also under investigation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said fans had left Johan Cruyff Arena without incident after the Europa League match, which Ajax won 5-0 against Maccabi Tel Aviv, but that clashes erupted overnight in the city centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is despite a ban on a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the soccer stadium imposed by Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema, who had feared that clashes would break out between protesters and supporters of the Israeli soccer club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halsema later said she was “ashamed” at what happened in the city, and  announced a temporary ban on protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli and Dutch leaders have condemned the violence. Israel initially ordered that two planes be sent to the Dutch capital to bring the football fans home, but later the prime minister's office said it would work on "providing civil aviation solutions for the return of our citizens”.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that “the harsh pictures of the assault on our citizens in Amsterdam will not be overlooked," and that Netanyahu "views the horrifying incident with utmost gravity." He demanded that the Dutch government take “vigorous and swift action" against those involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said he was "horrified by the anti-Semitic attacks on Israeli citizens", which he called "completely unacceptable".
  <br>
  <br>
  Schoof assured Netanyahu by phone that "the perpetrators will be identified and prosecuted", he said in a statement on the social media platform X. (Agencies)

    Trump names his White House chief of staff

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has named Susie Wiles, the de-facto manager of his victorious campaign, as his White House chief of staff, the first woman to hold the influential role.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wiles is widely credited within and outside Trump’s inner circle for running what was, by far, his most disciplined and well-executed campaign, and was seen as the leading contender for the position.
  <br>
  <br>
  She largely avoided the spotlight, even refusing to take the mic to speak as Trump celebrated his victory early Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  She resisted the formal title of campaign manager, avoiding becoming a target, given Trump’s history of cycling through people in that role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wiles’ hire is Trump’s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration, as he must quickly build the team that will help run the massive federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wiles doesn’t bring much federal government experience to the role, but has a close relationship with the president-elect.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign, Wiles was able to do what few others have been able to: help control Trump’s impulses — not by chiding him or lecturing, but by earning his respect and showing him that he was better off when he followed her advice than flouting it. (AP)

 President Xi Jinping will travel to Peru and Brazil next week for meetings of Apec and the G20, Beijing's foreign ministry said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi will go to Lima from November 13 to 17 and Rio de Janeiro from November 17 to 21, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Peru, Xi will "attend the 31st Apec Economic Leaders' Meeting and pay a state visit", Hua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will then travel to Rio de Janeiro from November 17 to 21 to attend the 19th G20 Summit and will pay a state visit to Brazil at the invitation of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Hua added.

  China is Brazil's top trading partner, exceeding US$180 billion in each-way trade in 2023, with semiconductors, phones and pharmaceuticals dominating exports to the South American country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A visit this year by Vice President Geraldo Alckmin was seen as paving the way for Brazil to join China's massive Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of South American nations, including Peru, have already signed up to the initiative. (AFP/Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden pledged a peaceful transfer of power Thursday after Donald Trump's stunning US election win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden, 81, urged Americans in a solemn televised address to "bring down the temperature," in stark contrast to Trump's refusal to accept his 2020 election defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Trump began to work at his Florida resort on his transition team, Biden said he would work for an "orderly" transfer of power.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech from the Rose Garden of the White House, he called for unity while urging Democrats not to lose hope, saying: "Remember, a defeat does not mean we are defeated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet finger-pointing has already erupted in the party over Biden's initial decision to run for a second term despite his age, before dropping out at the last minute in July and handing the reins to Harris, his vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House denied Biden had any regrets. "He believed it was the right decision to make at that time," Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. (AFP)

    Putin and Trump say they are ready to talk

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump indicated Thursday that they were ready to hold talks after the Republican tycoon emerged as the victor in the race for the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I take this opportunity to congratulate him," Putin said in remarks to the Valdai forum in the southern city of Sochi after Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he was open to holding talks with Trump, the Russian leader said: "Ready".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump revealed he was also prepared for some kind of conversation, telling NBC News in an interview that "I think we'll speak" as the topic turned to his contacts with world leaders since his victory was announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had spoken to "probably" 70 world leaders since Wednesday morning but revealed that he had not talked to Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow was widely accused of interfering in the 2016 presidential election to boost Trump's campaign against Hilary Clinton, although the Kremlin has repeatedly rejected those charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said he was impressed by how Trump handled himself during an assassination attempt at a rally earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He turned out to be a courageous person," Putin said. "People show who they are in extraordinary circumstances. This is where a person reveals himself. And he showed himself, in my opinion, in a very correct manner, courageously. Like a man," he added. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A British lawmaker was charged with assault on Thursday after he allegedly punched a passerby who he said had been threatening him after a Friday night out.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mike Amesbury was suspended from the governing Labour Party after CCTV and video footage showed him throwing a punch at a man and repeatedly hitting him after he was knocked to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Following a review of the evidence provided by Cheshire Police, we have authorised a charge of common assault against Mike Amesbury," said Rosemary Ainslie, Head of the Crown Prosecution Service's Special Crime Division.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The charge follows an alleged assault in Frodsham, Cheshire, on Saturday, 26 October 2024."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the incident, Amesbury, the Member of Parliament for Runcorn and Helsby in north-west England, said he felt threatened on the street after an evening out with friends, saying he co-operate with any inquiries if required. He said he would not make further public comment on the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Party did not immediately respond to a fresh request for comment after Amesbury was charged. They had previously said Amesbury was suspended from the party pending an investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local police said Amesbury was set to appear in court at a "later date" in relation to reports of an assault on a 45-year-old man. (Reuters)

    Fed chair cuts rates, stands ground against Trump

<img alt="The chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, says he plans to serve out his full term. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778068_1_20241108051635.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday that he would not resign if asked to leave early by President-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference after unveiling a quarter point interest rate cut, Powell -- whose term as Fed chair ends in 2026 -- added that firing any of the Fed's seven governors was also "not permitted under the law."
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments underscore the delicate balancing act policymakers may have to play in the next Trump administration, given the US president-elect's recent criticism of the Fed.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly accused Powell -- whom he first appointed to run the US central bank -- of working to favour the Democrats, and has suggested he would look to replace him once his term as Fed Chair ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president-elect has also said he would like "at least" a say over setting Fed interest rates, something not currently allowed under the bank's dual mandate from Congress to act independently to tackle both inflation and unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fed governors are nominated by the president, and appointed by the Senate to serve a 14-year term.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can also be appointed to serve out the remainder of a 14-year term if a Fed governor retires, and must then be reconfirmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  If he wanted to, Powell could stay on as a governor after he steps down as Fed chair, and serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in early 2028. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden will make an address to the nation on Thursday, vowing a peaceful transfer of power to Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden will speak in the Rose Garden of the White House at midnight Hong Kong time to "discuss the election results and the transition" to Trump's second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 81-year-old dropped out of the race against Trump in July and handed the Democratic nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris – but is now likely to see his legacy dismantled by the Republican's comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Biden spoke with Trump on Wednesday and "expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasised the importance of working to bring the country together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden also invited Trump to meet at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said Trump "looks forward to the meeting, which will take place shortly, and very much appreciated the call."
  <br>
  <br>
  It would be the first time they had met since Biden's poor debate performance against Trump in June that forced him out of the race. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Opposition leaders in Israel blasted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday for firing his defence minister, saying it threatened national security at a time of war.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a joint news conference in Jerusalem, they accused Netanyahu of putting his own political interests before the country's, following his decision the day before to dismiss Yoav Gallant.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He had the choice between disgrace and war, and he chose disgrace," said former prime minister Yair Lapid, voicing outrage at the move as Israel faces military pressures on multiple fronts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our soldiers cannot trust him. The citizens of Israel cannot trust him. Yesterday the whole State of Israel saw that', he said of Netanyahu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu's office announced the sacking of Gallant on Tuesday following public differences over the war with Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past few months... trust has eroded. In light of this, I decided today to end the term of the defence minister," Netanyahu's office said, adding that foreign minister Israel Katz would take his place, and that Gideon Saar was appointed foreign minister to replace Katz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading opposition figure Benny Gantz, who quit Netanyahu's government in June over its lack of a post-war plan for Gaza, called the timing of the move "absolute security negligence".
  <br>
  <br>
  "What should our fighters in Lebanon think today, seeing that the minister of defence is fired after he issues conscription orders?" he asked, referring to an order sent on Monday for the conscription of 7,000 ultra-Orthodox individuals, a community historically exempted from military service.
  <br>
  <br>
  The orders came at a time when Israel is struggling to bolster troop numbers, with ground forces deployed to fight Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, thousands of Israelis took to Tel Aviv's streets to protest against Gallant's dismissal on Tuesday night, chanting slogans against Netanyahu and demanding the return of 97 hostages held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Gallant said in a post on X that Israel's security would remain his life's "mission".
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on the government to bring home the hostages in Gaza while they were "still alive" and insisted all Israelis of draft age must serve in the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,391 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to Gaza health ministry figures which the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

 US Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a televised concession speech to the nation on Wednesday after a whirlwind campaign that failed to stop Republican Donald Trump's return to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  "While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign," she told supporters at her alma mater Howard University, a historically black college.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris pledged to continue fighting for women's rights and against gun violence, and to "fight for the dignity that all people deserve."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she had called President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition, and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power."
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris addressed a crowd that included former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, aides in President Joe Biden's White House and thousands of fans who listened to a soundtrack that included Beyonce's "Run the World (Girls)" and Tye Tribbett's "We Gon' Be Alright."
  <br>
  <br>
  Her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, joined the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris rose to the top of the Democratic ticket in July after Biden stepped aside and brought new-found enthusiasm and cash to the Democratic ticket, but struggled to overcome voters' concerns about the economy and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was handed a resounding loss, with Trump winning a greater share of votes across most of the country compared with his performance in 2020 and Democrats failing to secure key battleground states that decide elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands had gathered at Howard University, Harris' alma mater, on Tuesday night for what they hoped would be a historic victory for the first woman to become president.
  <br>
  <br>
  They came back on Wednesday to show their support after her loss. (Reuters)

File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777871_1_20241106220620.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Wednesday the election of Donald Trump as US president could put Washington's commitment to Ukraine at risk.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kristersson congratulated Trump on his victory in a post to X early Wednesday. He was looking forward "to working together and continuing the excellent US-Sweden relations as friends and allies", he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But hours later, Kristersson told a news conference that Trump's return to the Oval Office also carried risks, including "existential" ones for Sweden such as a potential US "reduced commitment to Ukraine".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to count on it," Kristersson told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the contrary, we take stock of the fact that the US is until now the single largest military aid donor to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't take it for granted."
  <br>
  <br>
  Added together, he noted, the Nordic and Baltic countries were the second-largest donor to the Ukrainian war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has cast doubt on continuing US military support for Kyiv, promising to cut a quick deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweden ended two centuries of military non-alignment and applied for Nato membership in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine -- becoming the US-led alliance's 32nd member in March of this year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's airports authority said operations at its main airport near Tel Aviv were not affected after Hezbollah claimed it fired missiles at an Israeli military base nearby on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Ben Gurion airport is open and operating as normal for takeoffs and landings," the authority's spokeswoman, Liza Dvir, told AFP, adding that the runway had been unaffected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon's Hezbollah said it fired missiles at an Israeli military base near the airport on Wednesday, the first such attack in more than a month of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Iran-backed group said the salvo of missiles targeted the Tzrifin military base near Ben Gurion International Airport, south of the Israeli commercial hub of Tel Aviv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Images posted on social media showed smoke rising near the airport while AFP photos from Ben Gurion showed no damage on the tarmac.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military did not confirm whether the base had been targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that "approximately 10 projectiles crossed from Lebanon" following sirens in northern and central Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of the projectiles were intercepted and one fallen projectile was identified in central Israel," it added. (AFP)

    'Four years of volatile China-US ties under Trump'

<img alt="President Xi Jinping and his then US counterpart Donald Trump meet at the G20 summit in Japan in 2019. Hong Kong-based political expert Brian Wong says he expects China-US relations to be volatile under the Trump presidency. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777857_2_20241106220018.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hong Kong-based political expert on Wednesday said Republican Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election would add uncertainty to Sino-American ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There's no guaranteed outcome... It's going to be an incredibly unpredictable and volatile four years, with more trade protectionism and tariffs, with potential escalation and flare-ups over geopolitical fault lines near China," Brian Wong, Assistant Professor of Philosophy and a fellow at the Centre on Contemporary China and the World at the University of Hong Kong, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong likened Trump's return to the White House to a game of Russian roulette for Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that Trump's backers included many China hawks, such as former US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and former acting US director of national intelligence Richard Grenell, as well as those with business interests in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Donald Trump also has enduring ties with many prominent businessmen with sizeable corporate interests and commercial interests in China, including (Blackstone CEO) Stephen Schwarzman and also (Tesla CEO) Elon Musk," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So how these different factions and also voices in his likely administration makeup and also in a circle of advisors on China influences him, that remains to be seen."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump was elected president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House and ushering in a new American leadership likely to test relations abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, recaptured the White House on Wednesday by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, Edison Research projected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president's victory in the swing state of Wisconsin pushed him over the threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate," Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Centre in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s political career had appeared to be over after his false claims of election fraud led a mob of supporters to storm the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he swept away challengers inside his Republican Party and then beat Democratic candidate Kamala Harris by capitalising on voter concerns about high prices and what Trump claimed, without evidence, was a rise in crime due to illegal immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris did not speak to supporters who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly later on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still have votes to count," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans won a US Senate majority, but neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voters identified jobs and the economy as the country's most pressing problem, according to Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many Americans remained frustrated by higher prices even amid record-high stock markets, fast-growing wages and low unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the administration of President Joe Biden taking much of the blame, a majority of voters said they trusted Trump more than Harris to address the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel Trump's election victory. His loyal base of rural, white and non-college educated voters again showed up in force.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump prevailed despite persistently low approval ratings. Impeached twice, he has been criminally indicted four times and found civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In May, Trump was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star.
  <br>
  <br>
  His victory will have major implications for US trade and climate change policies, the war in Ukraine, Americans' taxes and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  His tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and US allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon US debt, economists say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal. His opponents fear he will turn the Justice Department and other federal law enforcement agencies into political weapons to investigate perceived enemies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President Harris fell short in her 15-week sprint as a candidate, failing to galvanise enough support to defeat Trump, who occupied the White House from 2017-2021, or to allay voters' concerns about the economy and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris had warned that Trump wanted unchecked presidential power and posed a danger to democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump ran a campaign characterised by apocalyptic language. He called the United States a "garbage can" for immigrants, pledged to save the economy from "obliteration" and cast some rivals as the "enemy within."
  <br>
  <br>
  His diatribes were often aimed at migrants, who he said were "poisoning the blood of the country," or Harris, whom he frequently derided as unintelligent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite legal woes and controversies, Trump is only the second former president to win a second term after leaving the White House. The first was Grover Cleveland, who served two four-year terms starting in 1885 and 1893. (Reuters)

    Snow seen on Mount Fuji after record absence

<img alt="Photographs taken around Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain, where the skies were clearer showed a dusting of snow on its peak. Photo: Reuters via Kyodo News" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777826_1_20241106164139.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Snow has finally fallen on Mount Fuji, images showed on Wednesday, after warm weather led to the Japanese mountain's longest-ever stint with bare slopes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The volcano's famous snowcap begins forming on October 2 on average, and last year snow was first observed by government meteorologists on October 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's weather agency – which compares conditions from exactly the same location, Kofu City, each year – has not yet announced a new record for the slowest start to the snowcap, due to cloud cover at its monitoring station.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this year already marks the latest arrival of snow since comparative data became available in 1894, beating the previous record of October 26 – seen twice, in 1955 and 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photographs taken from different points around Japan's highest mountain where the skies were clearer early on Wednesday showed a dusting of snow on its peak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are photos of Mount Fuji, seen from the city hall this morning. We could see a thin layer of snow cover near the summit," said a post on the official X account of Fuji City, in Japan's central Shizuoka region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many others in the area also posted their own photographs of snow on the country's highest mountain, and aerial footage from national broadcaster NHK showed close-ups of white powder on the rocky slopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Finally, the first snow cover! Mount Fuji looks good with snow," said a post from a nursing home, also in Fuji City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mount Fuji is covered in snow for most of the year, but during the July-September hiking season, more than 220,000 visitors trudge up its steep, rocky slopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symmetrical mountain has been immortalised in countless artworks, including Hokusai's "Great Wave". It last erupted around 300 years ago. (AFP)

 Reactions from around the world began flooding in on Wednesday as Donald Trump claimed victory in the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  NATO chief Mark Rutte congratulated the Republican, saying his return to power will help keep the alliance "strong".
  <br>
  <br>
  "His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO," Rutte said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump’s apparent victory "history's greatest comeback" and a new beginning in the US-Israel alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congratulations on history's greatest comeback! Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!" said Netanyahu in a statement issued by his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also hailed Trump’s “historic election victory.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “I look forward to working with you in the years ahead. As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on social media platform X, French President Emmanuel Macron said he’s “ready to work together just as we knew how to do during four years. With your convictions and with mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity", Macron wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Trump on an “impressive” election victory, and said he hopes the result will bring “just peace in Ukraine closer.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, meanwhile, had this assessment of Trump on his official Telegram account.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Trump has one useful quality for us: as a businessman to the core, he mortally dislikes spending money on various hangers–on and stupid hanger-on allies, on bad charity projects and on voracious international organisations".
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also sent his congratulations, saying he was looking forward to working with the vote frontrunner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Heartiest congratulations my friend @realDonaldTrump on your historic election victory," Modi wrote on X. "As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration." (Agencies)

 China said on Wednesday it hoped for "peaceful coexistence" with the United States as Donald Trump appeared on the verge of a decisive victory over Kamala Harris in the country's presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our policy toward the United States has been consistent," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao did not comment directly on the possibility of Trump's re-election, but said "the United States presidential election is an internal affair of the United States".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We respect the choice of the American people," she said. "After the US election results are released and officially announced, we will handle related matters in accordance with usual practice," she added when asked if President Xi Jinping would call Trump to congratulate him. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Republican Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed victory in the 2024 US presidential contest after Fox News projected that he had defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, which would cap a stunning political comeback four years after he left the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  As jubilant supporters cheered and chanted "USA", Trump took to the stage at his campaign headquarters in Florida along with his wife Melania and several of his children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to help our country heal," the Republican former president said. "It's a political victory that our country has never seen before."
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Centre, Trump said "America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other news outlets had yet to call the race for Trump, but he appeared on the verge of winning after capturing the battleground states of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia and holding leads in the other four, according to Edison Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris did not speak to her supporters, who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly later on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We still have votes to count," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mood shifted had shifted sharply at the watch party as the results came in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am scared," said Charlyn Anderson. "I am anxious now. I am leaving, my legs can barely move."
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, the celebrations intensified at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and the watch party nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech tycoon Elon Musk, who has backed Trump and stands to lead a government efficiency commission under him, posted a picture of himself with the Republican.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Game, set and match," Musk said on X, the social media network he owns along with the Tesla electric vehicle firm and the Space X company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president was showing strength across broad swaths of the country, improving on his 2020 performance everywhere from rural areas to urban centres.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a further blow to Democrats, Trump's Republican Party also seized control of the Senate, flipping two seats to overturn a narrow Democratic majority. Neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump went into Election Day with a 50-50 chance of reclaiming the White House, a remarkable turnaround from January 6, 2021, when many pundits pronounced his political career to be over.
  <br>
  <br>
  That day, a mob of his supporters stormed Congress in a violent attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump picked up more support from Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and among lower-income households that have keenly felt the sting of price rises since the last presidential election in 2020, according to exit polls from Edison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump won 45 percent of Hispanic voters nationwide, trailing Harris with 53 percent but up 13 percentage points from 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 31 percent of voters said the economy was their top issue, and they voted for Trump by a 79-to-20 margin, according to exit polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 45 percent of voters across the country said their family's financial situation was worse off today than four years ago, and they favoured Trump 80 to 17 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global investors were increasingly pricing in a Trump win. US stock futures and the dollar pushed higher, while Treasury yields climbed and bitcoin rose – all flagged by analysts and investors as trades that favour a Trump victory. (Agencies)

    Republicans take control of US Senate

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Republican Party has wrested control of the US Senate from the Democrats, with at least 51 seats in the 100-member upper house of Congress, US networks projected early on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It gives the GOP a major power centre in Washington and a lead role in confirming the next president’s cabinet, as well as any Supreme Court justice if there is a vacancy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time the Republicans had a majority in the Senate was January 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Capitol is divided into the House of Representatives - where all 435 seats are up for grabs - and a 100-member Senate, which has 34 seats at stake this year. Congressional elections run alongside the White House race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim Justice, the sitting Republican governor of West Virginia, delighted Republicans early in the night when he emerged as an easy victor in the Senate race to replace retiring moderate Joe Manchin, an independent who voted with the Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohio then moved into the Republican column after longstanding Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown was defeated by Bernie Moreno, a Trump-endorsed businessman and the son of a one-time high-ranking Colombian government official.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats were looking to mitigate losses with gains in Texas and Florida, but conceded both as the sitting Republicans notched easy wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nonpartisan political finance monitor OpenSecrets reports that US$10 billion has been spent on candidates for Congress this cycle - a touch less than in 2020 but almost twice as much as the US$5.5 billion price tag for the 2024 White House race. (Agencies)

    Share prices and bond yields have surged as the Republican Party gained control of the Senate and Donald Trump was leading in the still-incomplete vote counts from Tuesday’s election. The full results may not be known for days as officials count all the votes, but investors already were repositioning in anticipation of gains by the Republicans, who took control of the Senate for the first time in four years.

    Americans in multiple states also voted on the issue of abortion on Tuesday. Voters in Missouri cleared the way to undo one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bans in one of four victories for abortion rights advocates, while Florida defeated a similar constitutional amendment, leaving in place a law barring most abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Colorado and Maryland.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Missouri and Florida results represent firsts in the abortion landscape, which underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion.

    <br>
    <br>
    "Pennsylvania is the most important one with 19 electoral votes, the most of the battleground states. It has become vital that Harris win that state to have any chance at all."
    <br>

    Niu noted Republicans are also doing well in congressional races and that there is a high chance that Trump and his party could "come away with a clean sweep", where Republicans control both bodies of Congress and the presidency.

    Kamala Harris' campaign says she will not address her supporters on election night. "You won't hear from the vice president tonight but you will hear from her tomorrow," Cedric Richmond, Harris campaign co-chair, told a watch party at Howard University in Washington.

     RTHK's San Francisco correspondent, Mark Niu, says Trump has a commanding lead so far. The Associated Press shows Trump narrowly leading in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which comes with the most electoral votes at 19. He said this was ironic, given that the state has the third largest Puerto Rican population in the US mainland, and that Trump called it a "floating island of garbage".
     <br>
     <br>
     "In exit polling, it appears that Trump is actually doing well among Latino voters," Niu said.

        Republicans are also vying for control of the US House of Representatives and Senate. While all eyes are on the White House race, hundreds of congressional elections will determine how much of the next president's agenda gets enacted.
        <br>

        Republicans are nudging ahead in their mission to wrest control of the Senate from the Democrats. US media have reported that Republican Bernie Moreno, a onetime car dealer who was born in Colombia, flipped an additional Senate seat for his party, besting a Democratic incumbent who has held the post since 2007. Republicans need to net just two Senate seats to win a majority in the chamber.

        Trump has called into a Wisconsin radio station to say: “I’m watching these results. So far so good". Harris did phone interviews with radio stations in the battleground states, then visited Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington carrying a box of Doritos – her go-to snack.
        <br>
        <br>
        The closeness of the race and the number of states in play raised the likelihood that, once again, a victor might not be known on election night. Trump said on Tuesday that he had no plans to tell his supporters to refrain from violence if Harris wins, because they “are not violent people”. Federal, state and local officials have expressed confidence in the integrity of the nation’s election systems. And both sides have armies of lawyers in anticipation of legal challenges on and after Election Day.

             "They're up to mischief, it seems. They don't want us to have a smooth, fair and accurate election, and if they can get us to fight among ourselves, they can count that as a victory," Raffensperger told reporters.

 Queen Camilla, wife of the Britain's King Charles, has been forced to pull out of her planned engagements this week after suffering a chest infection, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday.

  Camilla, 77, is resting at home while she recovers but no further details of her illness have been given, as is usual with royal medical issues.

  "Her Majesty The Queen is currently unwell with a chest infection, for which her doctors have advised a short period of rest," a palace spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With great regret, Her Majesty has therefore had to withdraw from her engagements for this week, but she very much hopes to be recovered in time to attend this weekend’s Remembrance events as normal." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday a large-scale medical evacuation was planned from Gaza this week, with more than 100 seriously ill and injured patients due to leave the war-ravaged territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said that, alongside its partners, it would evacuate as many as 113 patients on Wednesday, with most going to the United Arab Emirates and some heading to Romania for specialised care.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it goes ahead, it would be the largest evacuation from Gaza since October 2023, according to data from the UN health agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories, said he was hopeful the evacuation would go ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said efforts were currently under way to bring patients from various hospitals across the Gaza Strip to the Gaza European Hospital near Khan Yunis in the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will be transported to the Kerem Shalom crossing on early Wednesday and then flown on to the UAE and Romania, Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva, via video link from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those on the list figure among up to 14,000 people currently waiting in Gaza to be evacuated out of the territory for medical reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of them have sustained trauma injuries in the war and the others are suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the war in Gaza began following Hamas' deadly October 7, 2023 attack inside Israel, fewer than 5,000 people have been granted medical evacuations out of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only 282 have meanwhile been able to leave since Israel shuttered Gaza's main Rafah border crossing in early May, Peeperkorn said, adding that around a third of them had been children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peeperkorn lamented the "ad hoc" access to desperately-needed medical evacuations from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we need is regular access... which would be properly supported, facilitated and not made unnecessarily dangerous," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need medical corridors, and the first medical corridor we basically request to be restored is the traditional referral pathway from Gaza to East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and... a second medical corridor to Egypt should be open again, and maybe to Jordan."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,391 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health ministry figures which the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Election Day voting began in the United States on Tuesday after an extraordinary, and for many unnerving, presidential race that will either make Kamala Harris the first woman president in the country's history or hand Donald Trump a comeback that sends shockwaves around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the first polling stations opened, Democratic vice president Harris, 60, and Republican former president Trump, 78, were dead-even in the tightest and most volatile White House contest of modern times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bitter rivals spent their final day of the campaign frenetically working to get their supporters out to the polls and trying to win over any last undecided voters in the swing states expected to decide the outcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite a series of head-spinning twists in the campaign – from Harris's dramatic entrance when President Joe Biden dropped out in July, to Trump riding out two assassination attempts and a criminal conviction – nothing has broken the deadlock in the opinion polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polling stations opened from 6.00am in states including Virginia, North Carolina and New York. Tens of millions of voters are expected to cast their ballots, on top of the more than 82 million people who have already voted early in the preceding weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  A final outcome may not be known for several days if the results are as close as the polls suggest, adding to the tension in a deeply divided nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  And there are fears of turmoil and even violence if Trump loses, and then contests the result as he did in 2020, with barriers erected around the White House and businesses boarded up in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world is anxiously watching, as the outcome will have major implications for conflicts in the Middle East, for Russia's war in Ukraine, and for tackling climate change which Trump calls a hoax.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris and Trump are effectively tied in the seven main swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of the vote, Harris went all-in on the must-win state of Pennsylvania, rallying on the Philadelphia steps made famous in the "Rocky" movie and declaring: "momentum is on our side."
  <br>
  <br>
  However "this could be one of the closest races in history – every single vote matters," cautioned Harris, who was joined by celebrities including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who would become the first convicted felon and oldest person to win the presidency, cast himself as the only solution to an apocalyptic vision of the country in terminal decline and overrun by "savage" migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America – indeed, the world – to new heights of glory," Trump told his closing rally in Grand Rapids in the key swing state of Michigan, after touring North Carolina and Pennsylvania. (AFP)

    Harris, Trump make final pitch to US voters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris and Donald Trump made their final case on Monday in the hours before Election Day, when voters will either choose America's first woman president or hand the Republican an unprecedented comeback.
 <br>
  <br>
  With polls showing a dead heat, Trump promised to lead the United States to "new heights of glory" while Harris said the "momentum is on our side", as the rivals held their last rallies of the 2024 race in crucial battleground states.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Vice President finished on a high note in Philadelphia in the must-win state of Pennsylvania, with a rally on the steps immortalised by the boxing movie "Rocky". "This could be one of the closest races in history – every single vote matters," said Harris, who was joined by celebrities, including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also referenced the film, telling thousands of supporters that "here at these famous steps" she was paying "tribute to those who start as the underdog and climb to victory".
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris, 60, has repeatedly said she is the underdog, having only joined the race three months ago after President Joe Biden dropped out. But she insisted she would win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former president Trump brought several family members up on stage at his closing rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America – indeed, the world – to new heights of glory," he told the crowd, as the clocks ticked over into Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, also called on people to turn up on election day, saying his supporters can "put ourselves in a position to win, which we can do very easily if we show up".
  <br>
  <br>
  The world is watching as the outcome will have major implications for conflicts in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, and for tackling climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  And with Trump having narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July and police foiling a second alleged plot, the fears of violence are very real.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington, growing numbers of businesses and office buildings are being boarded up in case of unrest. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea has fined Facebook-parent Meta more than US$15 million for illegally collecting sensitive user information from nearly a million people without consent and sharing it with advertisers, the country's data watchdog said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which also owns Instagram, ran afoul of laws prohibiting the use of information on political opinions, religious beliefs and people's sex life unless the individual provides explicit consent, Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the tech giant collected sensitive information from around 980,000 domestic users in South Korea through their Facebook profiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  This included details about their religious beliefs and whether they are in a same-sex relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said it had confirmed that such information was provided to advertisers by Meta, with around 4,000 advertisers using it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta "analysed user behaviour data, including pages liked and ads clicked on Facebook", to create and implement targeted advertising related to "sensitive themes" such as transgender issues, homosexuality and North Korean defectors, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission said on Tuesday it had decided to fine Meta 21.6 billion won or US$15.6 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it "also ordered the company to establish legal grounds for processing sensitive information, implement safety measures, and respond diligently to users' requests for access to their personal data". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will visit China this week, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, on his first foreign tour as he seeks a more prominent position for Jakarta on the world stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 73-year-old ex-general's state visit will take place from Friday to Sunday, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo was sworn in on October 20, pledging to stick to Jakarta's traditionally non-aligned foreign policy while making the world's fourth-most populous nation more active abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  On his first planned foreign visits since taking power, Prabowo will also travel to Peru and Brazil for the Apec and G20 summits.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also expected to go to the United States and Britain, newspaper Kompas reported last month, citing presidential palace sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his February election win, Prabowo used his eight-month transition period to visit more than a dozen countries – including China – to showcase a more active foreign policy than his predecessor Joko Widodo, who focused more on domestic issues like the economy. (AFP)

    North Korea stages more missile launches

 North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea on Tuesday, its neighbours said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations hours before the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said at least seven North Korean missiles flew as far as 400 kilometres with a maximum altitude of 100 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  “North Korea’s actions, including a series of repeated missile launches, threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international community,” Nakatani said.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's military also detected several missile launches by North Korea and subsequently boosted its surveillance posture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The North Korean missiles could be used to target key facilities in South Korea, including US military bases there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launches came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to reach the US mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to that launch, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force.
  <br>
  <br>
  That drew condemnation from Kim’s powerful sister Kim Yo-jong, who on Tuesday accused North Korea’s rivals of raising tensions with “aggressive and adventuristic military threats.”
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean officials have said that North Korea was likely to dial up its military displays around the US presidential election to command the attention of Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s military intelligence agency said last week that North Korea has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside officials and analysts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win concessions such as sanctions relief after a new US president is elected. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Putin met North Korea's foreign minister in the Kremlin on Monday amid mounting concern in the West that North Korean soldiers are about to enter the Ukraine war on Moscow's side.
 <br>
  <br>
  Video of the meeting showed the pair shaking hands for a full minute as Putin greeted Choe Son Hui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin noted that they were meeting on Russia's National Unity Day, a public holiday, and Choe conveyed "sincere, warm, comradely greetings" from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States says North Korea has sent some 10,000 troops to Russia, including 8,000 to the western Kursk region where Russia is still battling to expel Ukrainian troops who broke across the border in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin, who signed a treaty with Kim in June that includes a mutual defence clause, has neither confirmed nor denied the North Korean troop presence. He has said that Russia is free to implement the pact as it sees fit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian leader briefly alluded to the military situation in Kursk when he met youth volunteers earlier on Monday, telling them: "When the enemy is cleaned out from the region, there will be lots of work for you to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Kyiv, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said he had discussed with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock the "need for decisive action" in response to North Korean involvement in the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said North Korean troops were waging "an aggressive war in Europe against a sovereign European state".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week urged Kyiv's allies to stop just "watching" and start taking action to tackle the presence of the North Koreans. (Reuters)

 The dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia as Moscow wages war in Ukraine highlights the need for security cooperation between the European Union and South Korea, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The deployment "regrettably illustrates the importance of our shared security agenda," he said before talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul in Seoul. The EU and South Korea are holding their first Strategic Dialogue meeting after Washington and Seoul sounded the alarm about North Korea sending troops to help Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Borrell also met South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun and expressed concern over the development, the South Korean defence ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an existential threat," Borrell said in a post on X and also posted a photo of him shaking hands with Kim. "The Republic of Korea is best positioned to understand it. We are united in our support to Ukraine. I encouraged them to step it up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Borrell said in a post on X on Sunday that he had visited the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas after arriving in South Korea following a trip to Japan, and described the visit as reminder of the need to invest more in peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said in another post that he was visiting South Korea to take security and defence cooperation between the EU and Seoul to "the next level", but gave no further details. Cho said last week that all possible scenarios were under consideration, when asked about whether Seoul could send weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea aiding Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including mine clearance equipment, but has resisted Kyiv's requests for weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul also sees it as likely that the North will be compensated by Moscow with military and civilian technology, as it races to launch a spy satellite and upgrade its missile capabilities. North Korea last week flexed its military muscle with the test of a huge new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed Hwasong-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington expects North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, to enter the fight against Ukraine soon, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  At talks in Moscow on Friday, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said her country intended to back Russia until it achieves victory in the Ukraine war. (Reuters)

<img alt="The government of Anthony Albanese is seeking to overcome workforce shortages. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777538_1_20241104194245.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia will spend A$600 million (US$395 million) on defence reserve recruitment and extending a cash bonus to retain troops as the centre-left Albanese government seeks to overcome workforce shortages, officials are expected to announce on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A review of Australia's defence force last year identified severe workforce pressures as a priority issue, even as the government lifts its defence budget to a record A$51.5 billion annually, revamping its northern military bases and acquiring long range strike capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  A defence workforce plan expected to be released on Tuesday cites a competitive national labour market and record low levels of unemployment as putting pressure on defence's ability to recruit, according to excerpts viewed by Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bonus scheme introduced last year will be extended until 2028 and expanded through the middle ranks, offering A$40,000 to defence force members who stay to "address hollowness in the force", the plan says.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Defence aims to achieve a permanent defence workforce of 69,000 by the early 2030s, with an overall combined defence and civilian workforce of around 100,000 by 2040, the plan says.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, there were around 57,000 permanent defence personnel, falling short of funded positions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our ADF personnel are our greatest capability, which is why it is crucial that the Defence workforce has the people it needs to help protect Australia’s strategic interests," Defence Minister Richard Marles said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia is spending up to A$368 billion to acquire nuclear powered submarines under the Aukus partnership with the United States and Britain, and has also allocated A$74 billion for missile systems, as it responds to rising tensions with China in the Indo Pacific region.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Australia cancelled a multibillion-dollar military satellite project with Lockheed Martin, saying it would instead shift its focus to a multi-orbit system to increase resilience for the Australian Defence Force. (Reuters)

    Legendary music producer Quincy Jones dies aged 91

<img alt="Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777508_2_20241104162429.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic "Thriller" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died on Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones’ passing," the family said in a statement. “And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical catalogue that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for "Roots" and "In the Heat of the Night," organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of “We Are the World,” the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lionel Richie, who co-wrote “We Are the World" and was among the featured singers, would call Jones “the master orchestrator.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In a career which began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, top honours likely go to his productions with Jackson: “Off the Wall,” “Thriller” and “Bad” were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones’ versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the “King of Pop.” On such classic tracks as “Billie Jean” and “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,” Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For “Thriller,” some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing “Beat It” and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Thriller” sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles’ “Greatest Hits 1971-1975” among others as the best-selling album of all time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If an album doesn’t do well, everyone says ‘it was the producers fault’; so if it does well, it should be your ‘fault,’ too,” Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. “The tracks don’t just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The list of his honours and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography “Q”, including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for “Roots.” He also received France’s Legion d’Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Centre tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, “Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones” and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author. (AP)

    Morales vows to continue his defiance of Bolivian govt

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bolivia's former President Evo Morales insisted on Sunday that he would press on with a hunger strike until the government of his protégé-turned-rival agreed to a political dialogue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Morales' supporters have blocked roads and caused disruptions around the country in protest against what they say is the government's political persecution of the former Bolivian leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morales, a larger-than-life figure still towering over Bolivian politics five years after his ouster, spoke on his third day without food from Chapare, Bolivia’s rural coca-growing region that serves as his stronghold.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My fight is to improve the situation in the country and to start a dialogue without conditions on two fronts, one economic and one political,” Morales told reporters from the office of the coca growers’ federation that he long has led.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president said he began his hunger strike on Friday in the hope that "international organisations or friendly governments" would facilitate talks with his political nemesis, President Luis Arce .
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions have surged over the past three weeks since pro-Morales supporters set up crippling roadblocks aimed at rebuking Arce — Morales' former economy minister with whom he is now vying to lead Bolivia’s governing socialist party into next year’s elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since mid-October, protesters have choked off major highways in defiance of an attempt by Arce's government to revive a 2016 statutory rape case against Morales, an ethnic Aymara who was the first member of an indigenous community to become the president of Latin America’s only indigenous-majority nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, the disruptions in transport have cost the South American country more than US$1.7 billion, according to Bolivia's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morales has denied any wrongdoing and rejects the charges as politically motivated.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My crime is being indigenous,” he said on Sunday. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least six people died after a volcano in eastern Indonesia erupted several times overnight, officials said on Monday, raising the alert level to the highest of a four-tiered system.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, located on the popular tourist island of Flores, spewed a tower of ash and lava on nearby villages that were forced to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to our coordination with the local authorities, six fatalities have been confirmed," Abdul Muhari, spokesman of the country's disaster management agency said on Monday in an interview on Kompas TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video clips showed villages near the volcano covered by thick ash, with some areas on fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country's volcanology agency raised the alert level to the highest mark, and told locals and tourists not to carry out activities within a seven-kilometre radius of the crater.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There has been a significant increase in volcanic activity on Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki," it said in a press release.
  <br>
  <br>
  It warned there was a potential for rain-induced lava floods and told locals to wear masks to avoid the effects of volcanic ash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mountain had several major eruptions in January, prompting authorities at the time to raise the alert status to the highest level and evacuate at least 2,000 residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent eruptions due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an area of intense volcanic and seismic activity. (AFP)

    Pro-EU Sandu claims victory in Moldova election

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Moldova’s Western-friendly President Maia Sandu won a second term in a presidential runoff against her opponent who was seen as preferring closer ties with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a race which was overshadowed by accusations of Russian interference, voter fraud, and intimidation in the European Union candidate country.
  <br>
  <br>
  With nearly 99 percent of votes counted in the second round of the presidential election held on Sunday, Sandu had 55 percent of the vote, according to the Central Electoral Commission, or CEC, compared with 45 percent for Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general who was backed by the pro-Russia Party of Socialists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result will be a major relief to those who backed Sandu’s candidacy and her push for Moldova becoming a member of the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Moldova, you are victorious! Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova!” Sandu said after claiming victory after midnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  She went on to claim that her country's vote had faced an “unprecedented attack" through alleged schemes including dirty money, vote-buying, and electoral interference “by hostile forces from outside the country" and criminal groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have shown that nothing can stand in the way of the people’s power when they choose to speak through their vote," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the final vote count, Stoianoglo told the media that “everyone’s voice deserves respect” and that he hopes “from now on, we will put an end to the hatred and division imposed on us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear if he had publicly commented on his electoral defeat. (AP)

    Angry crowds throw mud at Spain's king in Valencia

<div class="itemFullText">
 Furious locals hurled mud and insults at Spain's king, queen and prime minister on Sunday in a startling show of anger in the worst hit town in the flood disaster that has killed more than 210 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  More heavy rain fell on the Valencia region after King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were forced to leave Paiporta where more than 70 people died in floods last Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mud hit the monarchs in the face and clothes as they tried to calm the angry crowd in scenes that underscored the fury over the response to the disaster that has now killed at least 217 people with many more still missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The king and queen went to a crisis centre in Paiporta. But extra security guards soon had to keep the angry crowd away from the royals and prime minister. They put up umbrellas to stop mud hitting the royal couple.
  <br>
  <br>
  The king said later that Spain had to "understand the anger and frustration" of people affected by the devastation to towns where cars have been left in muddy heaps in streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a social media video, the king called on the public to give the victims "hope and their guarantee that the state in its entirety is present".
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the fury seemed directed at Prime Minister Sanchez and Valencia regional government head Carlos Mazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand the social anger and of course, I'm here to receive it. This is my political and moral obligation," Mazon said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rear window of Sanchez's car was broken before he and the local politicians quickly left. The socialist leader said that while he empathised with the "anguish and suffering" of the victims, he condemned "all forms of violence".
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency services on Sunday listed 213 dead in the Valencia region, one in Andalusia in the south and three in Castilla-La Mancha neighbouring Valencia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have warned the toll could rise as vehicles trapped in tunnels and underground car parks are cleared. (AFP)

 A top Slovak mountaineer died on a descent of the 7,234-metre Langtang Lirung peak in Nepal after an historic ascent up its east face, Slovakia's climbers association said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ondrej Huserka, a member of the Slovak national mountaineering team who had climbed in the Alps, Patagonia, Pamir Mountains and Himalayas, fell into a crevasse on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Czech climbing partner Marek Holecek said that the pair had just completed the first-ever ascent of the Langtang Lirung peak via the east face.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovak climbers association SHS James called for rescue action on Facebook but then said on Sunday that the helicopter could not take off because of bad weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Holecek confirmed the death in an emotional post on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Huserka had "hit an angled surface after an eight-metre drop, then continued down a labyrinth into the depths of the glacier".
  <br>
  <br>
  Holecek added that he had spent hours trying to rescue Huserka but failed as the Slovak was trapped head down and apparently paralysed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I rappelled down to him and stayed with him for four hours until his light faded. There's nothing more to add," Holecek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  SHS James said that the weather in Nepal would prevent rescue action in the days to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Following a phone call with Marek Holecek and his status published yesterday, and given the weather conditions under Langtang Lirung, the family and friends will have to cope with the fact that Ondrej is not with us any more," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovak daily SME described the 34-year-old Huserka as "one of the best Slovak mountaineers" who focused on rock and ice climbing. (AFP)

    Orban says Trump win would force Ukraine rethink

<div class="itemFullText">
 Europe will need to rethink its support of Ukraine if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Sunday, as the continent "will not be able to bear the burdens of the war alone".
 <br>
  <br>
  Orban opposes military aid to Ukraine and has made clear he thinks Trump shares his views and would negotiate a peace settlement for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  He backs former president Trump, the Republican candidate, to beat Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in Tuesday's US election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We (in Europe) need to realise that if there will be a pro-peace president in America, which I not only believe in but I also read the numbers that way... if what we expect happens and America becomes pro-peace, then Europe cannot remain pro-war," Orban said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine will be high on the agenda when European leaders meet in Budapest in the coming week, he said, referring to a European Political Community meeting and a more informal meeting of EU leaders due to take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Europe cannot bear the burden of [the war] alone, and if Americans switch to peace, then we also need to adapt, and this is what we will discuss in Budapest," Orban said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe is jittery about how the outcome of the US election will affect the war in Ukraine and the continent's security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orban has angered Brussels with his close ties to Russia and opposition to aid for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said in July that the Hungarian government sees Trump as a "chance for peace" in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, Orban said his team was assisting Trump's aides with policies on families and migration. On Thursday, he called Trump to wish him good luck ahead of Tuesday's election. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday claimed to have captured another Ukrainian village, just a dozen kilometres from the key eastern logistics hub Pokrovsk, as its troops advance rapidly.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Russian defence ministry said it had "liberated the settlement of Vichneve following offensive operations".
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has been making swift advances in the eastern Donetsk region for weeks, taking dozens of towns and villages.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Moscow said its forces had captured the large village of Kurakhivka close to the industrial town of Kurakhove, which Russia is also aiming to capture, and the small village of Pershotravneve in the Kharkiv region close to the eastern Lugansk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Capturing Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukraine that connects several fortresses in the Donbas, is one of Russia's main objectives in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also home to a major coke coal mine that is crucial to Ukraine's steel production for its military.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian troops have advanced to just a few kilometres outside the town.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian army took 478 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory in October, according to an AFP analysis of data from the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
  <br>
  <br>
  That marks a record since the first weeks of the conflict in March 2022. (AFP)

 The Israeli military called for the evacuation of the Baalbek area in eastern Lebanon, warning that it was poised to strike Hezbollah targets there and in nearby Douris.
 <br>
  <br>
  "You are currently located near the facilities and assets associated with Hezbollah, which the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) will be targeting in the near future," the Israeli military's Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X addressed to residents of Baalbek and Douris.

<img alt="Officials say drug-related crime in Poitiers has soared. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777343_1_20241102215300.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A 15-year-old boy shot in the head during a bloody shootout between drug gangs in the west of France on Saturday died of his wounds, the regional prosecutor announced, as the interior minister warned the country was at risk of "Mexicanisation" due to rising drug crime.
 <br>
  <br>
  The teen had been in intensive care since the shootings Thursday evening in the city of Poitiers, which have raised alarm nationwide over increasing violence in gangland turf wars that are making the streets unsafe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four other minors, aged between 15 and 16, were also injured by gunshots fired in front of a restaurant in the city in the incident which involved dozens of people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers used tear gas to break up the fight, restoring order around 45 minutes after arriving on the scene, the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on Friday that France's struggle with drug-related violence is at a "tipping point," with the nation facing a choice between "full mobilisation or the 'Mexicanisation' of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexico has suffered more than 450,000 drug-related killings since the government started using the military to fight its notorious drug cartels in 2006.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gangland violence long associated with the Mediterranean port city Marseille has expanded into other French cities in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims can include gang members, some of them minors guarding dealing spots or employed as hitmen, but also innocent bystanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Poitiers' experience on Thursday was "unprecedented" for the city of 90,000, mayor Leonore Moncond'huy said, adding that it "demonstrated rather serious developments in society."
  <br>
  <br>
  Retailleau, a member of the right-wing Republicans and seen as a hardliner on security issues, has called for the battle against drug violence to become a "nationwide effort" since becoming interior minister in Prime Minister Michel Barnier's shaky minority government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 'narco thugs' have no limits any more... These shootouts aren't happening in South America, they're happening in Rennes, in Poitiers... we're at a tipping point," Retailleau told BFMTV. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Air pollution in Pakistan's second biggest city Lahore soared on Saturday, around 40 times over the level deemed acceptable by the World Health Organisation (WHO), data from IQAir showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The level of deadly PM2.5 pollutants – fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health – peaked at 610, with a reading above 15 in a 24-hour period considered unhealthy by the WHO.
  <br>
  <br>
  The air quality index, which measures a range of pollutants, also spiked at 1,067.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have never reached a level of 1,000," said Jahangir Anwar, a senior environmental protection official in Lahore.
  <br>
  <br>
  For days, Lahore has been enveloped by smog, a mix of fog and pollutants caused by low-grade diesel fumes, smoke from seasonal agricultural burning and winter cooling.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the provincial environmental protection agency announced new restrictions in four "hot spots" in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuk-tuks equipped with polluting two-stroke engines are banned, as are restaurants that barbecue without filters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government offices and private companies will have half their staff work from home starting on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Construction work has been halted and street and food vendors, who often cook over open fires, must close at 8 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smog is particularly pronounced in winter when cold, denser air traps emissions from poor-quality fuels used to power the city's vehicles and factories at ground level. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 5.48-metre Australian crocodile that held the world record as the largest crocodile in captivity has died, a wildlife sanctuary said on Saturday. He was thought to be more than 110 years old.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cassius, weighing in at more than one ton, had been in declining health since October 15, Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat said on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was very old and believed to be living beyond the years of a wild Croc," according to a post by the organisation, based on Green Island near the Queensland tourist town of Cairns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cassius will be deeply missed, but our love and memories of him will remain in our hearts forever."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's website said he had lived at the sanctuary since 1987 after being transported from the neighbouring Northern Territory, where crocodiles are a key part of the region's tourist industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cassius, a saltwater crocodile, held the Guinness World Records title as the world's largest crocodile in captivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He took the title after the 2013 death of Philippines crocodile Lolong, who measured 6.17 metres long, according to Guinness. (Reuters)

    Badenoch elected new leader of UK Conservative Party

<img alt="Kemi Badenoch has called for a return to conservative values. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777338_1_20241102194657.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 "Anti-woke" candidate Kemi Badenoch on Saturday won the vote to become the UK Conservatives' new leader, replacing Rishi Sunak who quit after the party's disastrous showing in July's general election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Badenoch, 44, came out on top in the two-horse race with former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, winning 57 percent of the votes of party members.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that becoming party leader was an "enormous honour," but that "the task that stands before us is tough."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to be honest about the fact we made mistakes" and "let standards slip," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is time to get down to business, it is time to renew," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The combative former equalities minister now faces the daunting task of reuniting a divided and weakened party that was emphatically ousted from power in July after 14 years in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badenoch will become the official leader of the opposition and face off against Labour's Keir Starmer in the House of Commons every Wednesday for the traditional Prime Minister's Questions.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, she will be leading a much-reduced cohort of Tory MPs in the chamber following the party's dismal election showing.
  <br>
  <br>
  She must plot a strategy to regain public trust while stemming the flow of support to the right-wing Reform UK party, led by Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having campaigned on a right-wing platform, she also faces the prospect of future difficulties within the ranks of Tory lawmakers, which includes many centrists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badenoch, born in London to Nigerian parents and raised in Lagos, has called for a return to conservative values, accusing her party of having become increasingly liberal on societal issues such as gender identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  She describes herself as a straight-talker, a trait that has caused controversy on the campaign trail.
  <br>
  <br>
  When addressing immigration, Badenoch said that "not all cultures are equally valid" when deciding who should be allowed to live in the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was widely criticised after suggesting that statutory maternity pay on small businesses was "excessive" and sparked further furore when she joked that up to 10 percent of Britain's half a million civil servants were so bad that they "should be in prison." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain will deploy 10,000 more troops and police officers to the eastern Valencia region devastated by historic floods that have killed 211 people, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of finding survivors more than three days after torrents of muddy water submerged towns and wrecked infrastructure were slim in the European country's deadliest such disaster in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all the deaths have been recorded in the eastern Valencia region, where thousands of security and emergency services personnel were frantically clearing debris and mud in the search for bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez said in a televised address that the disaster was the second deadliest flood in Europe this century and announced a huge increase in the security forces for relief works.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had accepted the Valencia region leader's request for 5,000 more troops and informed him of a further deployment of 5,000 police officers and civil guards, Sanchez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain was carrying out its largest deployment of army and security force personnel in peacetime, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Restoring order and distributing aid to destroyed towns and villages – some of which have been cut off from food, water and power for days – is a priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have come under fire over the adequacy of warning systems before the floods, and some stricken residents have complained the response to the disaster is too slow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am aware the response is not enough, there are problems and severe shortages... towns buried by mud, desperate people searching for their relatives," Sanchez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Susana Camarero, deputy head of the Valencia region, told journalists on Saturday that essential supplies had been delivered "from day one" to all accessible settlements.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was "logical" that affected residents were asking for more, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in the Valencia region have restricted access to roads for two days to allow emergency services to carry out search, rescue and logistics operations more effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have said dozens of people remain unaccounted for.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with telephone and transport networks severely damaged, establishing a precise figure is difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska on Friday told Cadena Ser radio station that it was "reasonable" to believe more fatalities would emerge.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also hoped that the estimated number of missing people will fall once telephone and internet services are running again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of ordinary citizens pushing shopping trolleys and carrying cleaning equipment took to the streets on Friday to help with the clean-up effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Camarero said some municipalities were "overwhelmed by the amount of solidarity and food" they had received.
  <br>
  <br>
  The surge in togetherness continued on Saturday as around 1,000 people set off from the Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia towards nearby towns laid waste by the floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have urged them to stay at home to avoid congestion on the roads that would hamper the work of emergency services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm that sparked the floods on Tuesday formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for this time of year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But scientists warn that climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events. (AFP)

 Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed on Saturday to respond to attacks by Israel and its ally the United States against Tehran and groups it supports in the region.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The enemies, both the USA and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a tooth-breaking response to what they are doing against Iran, the Iranian nation, and the resistance front," said Khamenei at a student gathering in Tehran, referring to the alliance of Tehran-backed groups that include Yemen's Houthis, Lebanese Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes as Washington announced the deployment of additional military assets to the Middle East, including ballistic missile defense destroyers and long-range B-52 bomber aircraft, serving as a warning to Iran as it and Israel trade tit-for-tat strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it had launched rockets at an Israeli intelligence base near Tel Aviv in the early hours of Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hezbollah and Israel exchanged cross-border fire for nearly a year after Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war, before Israel ramped up the conflict on September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group frequently claims to have fired rockets at Israeli bases or urban areas in Israeli territory, and has several times claimed the targeting of Glilot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said on Saturday that sirens were activated following the arrival of "suspicious aerial targets" from Lebanon and the targets remained under surveillance in an ongoing incident. (AFP)

    Japan urges 200,000 to evacuate due to heavy rain

 Nearly 200,000 people in western Japan were urged to evacuate on Saturday as authorities warned of landslides and floods while the remnants of a tropical storm trickle over the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Japan Meteorological Agency said "warm, moist air... was causing heavy rainfall with thunderstorms in western Japan" partly due to Kong-rey, which was downgraded to an extratropical low-pressure system from a typhoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city of Matsuyama "issued the top-level warning, urging 189,552 residents in its 10 districts to evacuate and immediately secure safety," a city official told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the evacuation was not mandatory, Japan's highest-level warning is typically issued when it is extremely likely that some kind of disaster has already occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters warned that landslides and floods could affect western Japan on Saturday and eastern Japan on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Due to rain, shinkansen bullet trains were briefly suspended between Tokyo and southern Fukuoka region in the morning before resuming on a delayed schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kong-rey smashed into Taiwan on Thursday as one of the biggest storms to hit the island in decades. It claimed at least two lives and knocked out power to tens of thousands of households.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say human-driven climate change is intensifying the risk posed by heavy rains because a warmer atmosphere holds more water. (AFP)

    'Brat' named word of the year by Collins dictionary

<img alt="Thanks to singer Charli XCX the word 'brat' now means a lot more than simply a badly-behaved child. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777242_1_20241101192506.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brat, the word redefined by singer Charli XCX and adopted by supporters of US presidential candidate Kamala Harris, was on Friday named the Collins Word of the Year 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Brat" was the name of the UK singer's hit sixth album, and the word has now come to represent a "confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude," said Collins, rather than simply a term for a badly-behaved child.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Inspired by the Charli XCX album, 'brat' has become one of the most talked about words of 2024," said the UK-based dictionary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than a hugely successful album, 'brat' is a cultural phenomenon that has resonated with people globally, and 'brat summer' established itself as an aesthetic and a way of life," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old pop star, whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison, described the typical brat girl as someone "who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes, who feels herself, but then also maybe has a breakdown, but kind of parties through it."
  <br>
  <br>
  She tweeted in July that "Kamala IS brat," in reference to the US Vice President, prompting the presidential nominee to use her song "365" in one of her TikTok videos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her campaign account also re-branded with a lime green photo in the style of the Brat album cover.
  <br>
  <br>
  The album hit number one in her native UK and number three in the US. (AFP)
