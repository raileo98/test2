<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities said they were investigating why a single office tower block under construction in Bangkok collapsed during Friday's earthquake that otherwise caused limited damage in the capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok governor Chadchart Sittipunt visited the site on Monday as heavy equipment pulled away rubble from the 30-storey State Audit Office building in hopes of finding the 78 people still missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even one life saved is worth all the effort, so I think we have to move on, carry on,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the longer run it's important to ensure building safety in the city, where millions of people live and work in thousands of high-rise buildings, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The magnitude 7.7 quake, which was centred more than 1,200 km away, killed more than 2,000 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, most of them at the Bangkok construction site near the popular Chatuchak Market.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we need to find the root cause so at least we can learn some lessons and improve building regulations," Chadchart said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the end, we will have some results that will improve safety in Bangkok.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in the property developer handling the project, Italian Thai Development, fell 27 percent in trading on Monday as questions were raised about the building's design, enforcement of construction safety codes, and the Chinese contractor building the State Audit Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, whose family owns one of Thailand’s largest construction conglomerates, said he has ordered an investigation committee to be set up and to report the results back to him within seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed to three possible factors behind the collapse: the designer, the inspectors or the builders. (AP)

    Impeachment crunch time for Yoon on Friday

<img alt="Yoon Suk-yeol will learn whether he has the top job in South Korea come Friday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798397_1_20250401101622.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s Constitutional Court said it will rule on whether to formally dismiss or reinstate impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It has been deliberating on Yoon’s political fate over his ill-fated imposition of martial law that triggered a massive political crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The won reversed earlier losses to turn higher against the US dollar after the announcement of the ruling date.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market's benchmark KOSPI was up 1.5 percent after the announcement of the ruling, after pairing earlier gains to 0.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court, which currently has eight justices with one seat vacant, can decide to oust Yoon only when six or more judges agree, according to South Korea's constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whatever decision is, it will likely deepen domestic divisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millions have rallied in Seoul and elsewhere to support or denounce Yoon in the past few months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they’ll mobilize all available personnel to preserve order and respond to acts of vandalism, arson and assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition-controlled liberal National Assembly in December voted to impeach Yoon, a conservative, leaving his political fate in the hands of the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is facing a separate criminal trial after he was arrested and indicted by prosecutors in January on rebellion charges in connection with his December 3 martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court’s endorsement of Yoon’s impeachment would officially drive him out of office and prompt a national election within two months to find a new president.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it overturns Yoon’s impeachment, he would immediately return to his presidential duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the heart of the matter is Yoon’s decision to send hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after imposing martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has insisted that he aimed to maintain order, but some military and military officials have said Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to frustrate a floor vote on his decree and detain his political opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon argues that he didn’t intend to maintain martial law for long, and he only wanted to highlight what he called the “wickedness” of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda, impeached senior officials and slashed his budget bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his martial law announcement, he called the assembly “a den of criminals” and “anti-state forces.”
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, a president has the right to declare martial law in wartime or other emergency situations, but the Democratic Party and its supporters say South Korea wasn’t in such a situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Party-led impeachment motion accused Yoon of suppressing parliament's activities, attempting to detain politicians and others and undermining peace in violation of the constitution and other laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has said he had no intention of disrupting National Assembly operations and detaining anyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s martial law lasted only six hours because lawmakers managed to enter the assembly and vote to strike down his decree unanimously.
  <br>
  <br>
  No violence erupted, but live TV footage showing armed soldiers arriving at the assembly invoked painful memories of past military-backed dictatorships. It was the first time for South Korea to be placed under martial law since 1980. (AP/Reuters)

    Myanmar to mark minute of silence for quake victims

<img alt="An aerial view shows flattened buildings in the Mandalay region, Myanmar. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798381_1_20250401091723.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar will mark a minute of silence on Tuesday in tribute to victims of the country's devastating earthquake that has killed more than 2,000 people, as hopes dim of finding more survivors in the rubble of ruined buildings.
 <br>
  <br>
  National flags will fly at half-mast until April 6 "in sympathy for the loss of life and damages" from Friday's massive quake, the ruling junta said in a statement on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of a week of national mourning, the junta announced the minute's silence to begin Tuesday at 12:51:02 pm - the precise time the 7.7-magnitude quake struck.
  <br>
  <br>
  People should stop where they are to pay respect to the victims, the junta said, while media should halt broadcasting and show mourning symbols, and prayers will be offered at temples and pagodas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the tempo and urgency of rescue efforts wound down in Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country's second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta said Monday that 2,056 have now been confirmed dead, with more than 3,900 people injured and 270 still missing, but the toll is expected to rise significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three Chinese nationals are said to be among the dead, along with two French people.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 19 deaths have been confirmed hundreds of kilometres away in Thailand's capital Bangkok, where the force of the quake caused a 30-storey tower block under construction to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diggers continue to clear the vast pile of rubble at the site, where a dozen deaths have been confirmed and at least 75 people are still unaccounted for. Officials say they have not given up hope of finding more survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States said on Monday it had dispatched a disaster relief team to Myanmar, defending the pace of the deployment following President Donald Trump's dismantling of America's main overseas aid agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake struck on Friday, on the same day that Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was formally dissolving the US Agency for International Development (USAID), arguing that the "gains were too few and the costs were too high," after cutting more than 80 percent of its projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, Russia and India have already sent teams to Myanmar. (AFP)

    Nasa's astronauts speak after unexpected stay in space

<img alt="Nasa astronauts, from left - Nick Hague, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore - speak out for the first time since their return to Earth. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798377_1_20250401090640.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams said on Monday that they hold themselves partly responsible for what went wrong on their extended stay in space and would fly on Boeing's Starliner again.
 <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX recently ferried the duo home after more than nine months at the International Space Station, filling in for Boeing, which returned to Earth without them last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In their first news conference since coming home, the pair said they were taken aback by all the interest and insisted they were only doing their job and putting the mission ahead of themselves and even their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore didn't shy from accepting some of the blame for Boeing's bungled test flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ll start and point the finger and I’ll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide,” he told reporters. “All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Both astronauts said they would strap into Starliner again. “Because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work,” Wilmore said, adding he'd go back up “in a heartbeat.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams noted that Starliner has “a lot of capability” and she wants to see it succeed. “We're all in,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two will meet with Boeing leadership on Wednesday to provide a rundown on the flight and its problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not for pointing fingers,” Wilmore said. “It's just to make the path clearer going forward.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The longtime astronauts and retired Navy captains ended up spending 286 days in space - 278 days more than planned when they blasted off on Boeing’s first astronaut flight on June 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test pilots had to intervene in order for the Starliner capsule to reach the space station, as thrusters failed and helium leaked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their space station stay kept getting extended as engineers debated how to proceed. NASA finally judged Starliner too dangerous to bring Wilmore and Williams back and transferred them to SpaceX. But the launch of their replacements got stalled, stretching their mission beyond nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dragged-out drama finally ended two weeks ago with a flawless splashdown by SpaceX off the Florida Panhandle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa said engineers still do not understand why Starliner’s thrusters malfunctioned; more tests are planned through the summer. If engineers can figure out the thruster and leak issues, “Starliner is ready to go," Wilmore said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The space agency may require another test flight - with cargo - before allowing astronauts to climb aboard. That redo could come by year's end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Starliner’s rocky road, Nasa officials said they stand behind the decision made years ago to have two competing US companies providing taxi service to and from the space station. But time is running out: The space station is set to be abandoned in five years and replaced in orbit by privately operated labs. (AP)

    Trump task force to review Harvard's funding

<div class="itemFullText">
 Harvard University has become the latest target in the Trump administration’s approach to fight campus anti-semitism, with the announcement of a new “comprehensive review” that could jeopardise billions of dollars for the Ivy League college.
 <br>
  <br>
  A federal anti-semitism task force is reviewing more than US$255 million in contracts between Harvard and the federal government to make sure the school is following civil rights laws, the administration announced on Monday. The government also will examine US$8.7 billion in grant commitments to Harvard and its affiliates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The same task force cut US$400 million from Columbia University and threatened to slash billions more if it refused a list of demands from President Donald Trump's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Columbia agreed to many of the changes this month, drawing praise from some Jewish groups and condemnation from free speech groups, who see it as a stunning intrusion by the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of other universities have been put on notice by the Trump administration that they could face similar treatment over allegations of anti-semitism. The federal government is a major provider of revenue for American universities through grants for scientific research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education Secretary Linda McMahon said Harvard symbolises the American Dream, but has jeopardised its reputation by “promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry” and failing to protect students from anti-semitism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard President Alan Garber acknowledged that anti-semitism exists even on his campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but he said Harvard has done much to fight it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard will ensure the government has a full account of the university's work, Garber said. If federal funding is pulled, he added, it will “halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's renewed offensive in Gaza has reportedly left at least 322 children dead and 609 wounded in the Palestinian territory in the past 10 days, UNICEF said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figures include children who were reportedly killed or wounded when the surgical department of Al Nasser Hospital, in southern Gaza, was hit in an attack on March 23, the UN children's agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  UNICEF said most of these children were displaced, and sheltering in makeshift tents or damaged homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ending a nearly two-month ceasefire in the war with Hamas, Israel resumed intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 and then launched a new ground offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire in Gaza provided a desperately needed lifeline for Gaza's children and hope for a path to recovery," said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But children have again been plunged into a cycle of deadly violence and deprivation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell added: "All parties must adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect children."
  <br>
  <br>
  The UNICEF statement said that after nearly 18 months of war, more than 15,000 children have reportedly been killed, over 34,000 reportedly injured, and nearly one million children have been displaced repeatedly and denied basic services.
  <br>
  <br>
  UNICEF called for an end to hostilities and for Israel to end its ban on humanitarian aid entering Gaza, which has been in force since March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said children who are sick or wounded should be evacuated to receive medical attention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Food, safe water, shelter, and medical care have become increasingly scarce. Without these essential supplies, malnutrition, diseases and other preventable conditions will likely surge, leading to an increase in preventable child deaths," UNICEF said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world must not stand by and allow the killing and suffering of children to continue," it added. (AFP)

 OpenAI on Monday said it raised US$40 billion in a new funding round that valued the ChatGPT maker at US$300 billion, the biggest capital-raising session ever for a startup.

  The infusion of cash comes in a partnership with Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group and "enables us to push the frontiers of AI research even further," the San Francisco-based company said in a post on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their support will help us continue building AI systems that drive scientific discovery, enable personalised education, enhance human creativity, and pave the way toward AGI (artificial general intelligence) that benefits all of humanity," the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AGI refers to a computing platform with human-level intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank said in a release that it is on a mission to realise Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that surpasses human intelligence, and that OpenAI is the partner closest to achieving that goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advancement of OpenAI's AI models is key to achieving AGI and ASI, and massive computing power is essential," SoftBank stated in its rationale for the latest investment in the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank is to pump US$10 billion into OpenAI to start, and US$30 billion more by the end of this year pending certain conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI plans to scale its infrastructure and "deliver increasingly powerful tools for the 500 million people who use ChatGPT every week." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said Monday he would be "very kind" to trading partners when he unveils further tariffs this week, risking global turmoil to address what he says are unfair trade imbalances.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump - who has been making unprecedented use of presidential powers since taking office in January - said he could announce as early as Tuesday night exactly what "reciprocal tariffs" will be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican billionaire insists that reciprocal action is needed because the world's biggest economy has been "ripped off by every country in the world," promising "Liberation Day" for the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could also unveil more sector-specific levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for details, he told reporters Monday: "You're going to see in two days, which is maybe tomorrow night or probably Wednesday."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added: "We're going to be very nice, relatively speaking, we're going to be very kind."
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics warn that the strategy risks a global trade war, provoking a chain reaction of retaliation by major trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already, China, South Korea and Japan agreed on Sunday to strengthen free trade between themselves, ahead of Trump's expected tariff announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said on Monday that he was not worried his action would push allies toward Beijing, adding that a deal on TikTok could also be tied to China tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, President Trump downplayed risks that TikTok was in danger of being banned in the United States, saying he was confident of finding a buyer for the app's US business by a Friday deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has over 170 million American users, is under threat from a law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner ByteDance or face a ban in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican president quickly announced a delay that has allowed it to continue to operate; that delay is set to expire on April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of potential buyers. There's tremendous interest in TikTok," Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One late Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of people that want to buy TikTok. We're dealing with China also on it, because they may have something to do with it," he said, adding "I'd like to see TikTok remain alive." (AFP)

    Kremlin says Putin 'remains open' to speaking to Trump

<img alt="US President Donald Trump (Left) earlier criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin for the lack of progress on a ceasefire deal. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798328_1_20250331211156.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday said that President Vladimir Putin was still "open" to speaking to Donald Trump after the US president said he was "very angry" with the Russian leader over little progress on a ceasefire in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier criticised both Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, as he pushes to end more than three years of conflict in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told NBC he was "pissed off" at Putin for questioning Zelensky's credibility as someone to negotiate with and for calling for new authorities in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The president remains open to contact with President Trump," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing call.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there was no phone call scheduled between the two leaders, but that one could be "organised promptly" if deemed "necessary".
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin earlier this month rejected a US proposal of an unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, that Zelensky backed, and has upped his rhetoric on Moscow wanting to install new leadership in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are continuing work.. Firstly, on developing bilateral relations and also working on implementing some ideas, linked to resolving the Ukrainian (conflict)," Peskov said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Work is ongoing. There is nothing concrete yet. This process is time-consuming, probably due to the fact of the complexity of the substance," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, NBC News journalist Kristen Walker said Trump had called her to say he was angry with Putin and threatened tariffs on firms dealing with Russian oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later said he was "disappointed" with Putin for his comments on Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's supposed to be making a deal with him, whether you like him or you don't like him," Trump said. (AFP)

    Tokyo updates toll for next potential 'megaquake'

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The Fukushima nuclear disaster was one of three 2011 chain of events that changed the way that Tokyo traditionally regarded the 'megaquake' scenario. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798306_1_20250331182035.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A "megaquake" and subsequent tsunami could cause up to 298,000 deaths in Japan and damage costing up to US$2 trillion, the government said on Monday in a new estimate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figures have been updated from a previous estimate, made in 2014, for the potential consequences of a huge earthquake along the Nankai Trough south of Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 800-kilometre undersea trench runs from Shizuoka, west of Tokyo, to the southern tip of Kyushu island.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is where the Philippine Sea oceanic tectonic plate is "subducting" –  or slowly slipping – underneath the continental plate that Japan sits atop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plates become stuck as they move, storing up vast amounts of energy that is released when they break free, causing potentially massive earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cabinet Office's disaster management working group said up to 215,000 people would be killed by a tsunami, 73,000 by the collapse of buildings and 9,000 by fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the predicted toll as a whole is lower than the 2014 estimate that said up to 323,000 people would die.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past 1,400 years, megaquakes in the Nankai Trough have occurred every 100 to 200 years. The last one happened in 1946.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say it is extremely difficult to predict quakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in January, a government panel said the probability of such a megaquake in the next 30 years has marginally increased, with a 75-82 percent chance of it happening.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued its first "megaquake advisory" under rules drawn up after the devastating 2011 earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the likelihood of a new major earthquake along the Nankai Trough was higher than normal after a magnitude 7.1 jolt in southern Japan that injured 14 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advisory was lifted after a week but caused shortages of rice and other staples as people replenished their emergency stocks. (AFP)

    Le Pen hit with immediate court ban on public office

<img alt="Marine Le Pen arrives in court for the verdict. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798290_1_20250331172739.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A French court on Monday banned far-right leader Marine Le Pen from running for office after her conviction over a fake jobs scheme, specifying that the sanction should come into force with immediate effect even if an appeal is lodged.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ruling could mean that Le Pen will not be able to stand for president in 2027 elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  She left the courtroom after her conviction and this sanction were announced, but before the judge announced rulings on a potential prison sentence and fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court had earlier in the day found Le Pen guilty of misappropriating EU funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen, head of the far-right National Rally, is the front-runner in opinion polls ahead of the 2027 vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors had asked that Le Pen face an immediate five-year ban from public office if found guilty, regardless of any appeal process, using a so-called "provisional execution" measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  An automatic five-year ban would hammer Le Pen, 56, a three-time presidential contender who has said 2027 will be her final run for top office.
  <br>
  <br>
  She would retain her parliamentary seat until the end of her mandate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen has accused prosecutors of seeking her "political death," alleging a plot to keep the National Rally from power that echoes claims made by US President Donald Trump about his legal woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen, the National Rally and two dozen party figures were accused of diverting European parliament funds to pay France-based party staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants said the money was used legitimately and the allegations define too narrowly what a parliamentary assistant does.
  <br>
  <br>
  However judge Benedicte de Perthuis ruled: "It was established that all these people were actually working for the party, that their [European Union] lawmaker had not given them any tasks."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The investigations also showed that these were not administrative errors ... but embezzlement within the framework of a system put in place to reduce the party's costs."  (Reuters)

    Myanmar marks quake with week of mourning

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's ruling junta declared a week of national mourning on Monday for the country's devastating earthquake, which has killed more than 1,700 people, as hopes faded of finding more survivors in the rubble of ruined buildings.
 <br>
  <br>
  National flags will fly at half-mast until April 6 "in sympathy for the loss of life and damages" from Friday's massive 7.7-magnitude quake, the junta said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the tempo and urgency of rescue efforts wound down in Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country's second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation is so dire that it's hard to express what is happening," said Aung Myint Hussein, chief administrator of Mandalay's Sajja North mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  People camped out in the streets across Mandalay overnight, either unable to return to ruined homes or nervous about the repeated aftershocks that rattled the city over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some had tents but many, including young children, simply bedded down on blankets in the middle of the roads, trying to keep as far from buildings as possible for fear of falling masonry.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,700 people are confirmed dead across Myanmar, according to the military junta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands more were injured and more than 300 remain missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 18 deaths have been confirmed hundreds of kilometres away in Bangkok, where the force of the quake caused a 30-storey tower block under construction to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, with communications down in much of Myanmar, the true scale of the disaster has yet to emerge and the death toll is expected to rise significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mandalay's 1,000-bed general hospital has been evacuated, with hundreds of patients being treated outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  With temperatures forecast to hit 40 degrees Celsius on Monday, patients lay on gurneys in the hospital car park, many with only a thin tarpaulin rigged up to shield them from the fierce tropical sun.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives did their best to comfort them, holding hands or waving bamboo fans over them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very, very imperfect condition for everyone," said one medic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're trying to do what we can here. We are trying our best."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sticky heat has exhausted rescue workers and accelerated body decomposition, which could complicate identification.
  <br>
  <br>
  But traffic began returning to the streets of Mandalay on Monday, and restaurants and street vendors resumed work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of Muslims gathered outside a destroyed mosque in the city for the first prayer of Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that follows the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aftershocks rattled Mandalay over the weekend, several times sending residents fleeing into the streets in brief moments of panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The challenges facing the Southeast Asian country of more than 50 million people were immense even before the earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar has been ravaged by four years of civil war sparked by a military coup in 2021, with its economy shattered and healthcare and infrastructure badly damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization declared the quake a top-level emergency as it urgently sought US$8 million to save lives and prevent disease outbreaks over the next 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has launched an appeal for more than US$100 million to help victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid and rescue teams have been arriving after junta chief Min Aung Hlaing made an exceptionally rare appeal for foreign assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past, isolated Myanmar's ruling generals have shunned foreign assistance, even after major natural disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun thanked key allies China and Russia for their help, as well as India, and said the authorities were doing their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Bangkok, rain fell on Monday morning at the site of the collapsed building, where diggers continued to clear the vast pile of rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say they have not given up hope of finding more survivors in the wreckage, where 11 deaths have been confirmed and at least 76 people are still unaccounted for. (AFP)

    US tariffs to target 'all countries'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said the tariffs he plans to impose in the coming days would include "all countries," not just those with the largest trade imbalances with the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised a "Liberation Day" on Wednesday, when he is set to unveil reciprocal levies to address trade practices that his government deems unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You'd start with all countries, so let's see what happens," he said onboard Air Force One, dashing hopes he might scale back some of the threatened levies or that they would target a select group with persistent trade imbalances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't heard a rumor about 15 countries, 10 or 15," he said when asked which nations would be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been talking about all countries, not a cutoff."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's upcoming tariff salvo had been expected to target the 15 percent of partners that have persistent trade imbalances with the United States, a group Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called a "Dirty 15."
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite widening the target, the president insisted his tariffs would be more "generous" than those levied against the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tariffs will be far more generous than those countries were to us, meaning they will be kinder than those countries were to the United States of America over the decades," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They ripped us off like no country has ever been ripped off in history and we're going to be much nicer than they were to us.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it's substantial money for the country nevertheless."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has already slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and additional levies on imports from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tariffs on imported autos are also due to take effect on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's top trade aide Peter Navarro said the tax on auto imports could raise US$100 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And in addition, the other tariffs are going to raise about US$600 billion a year, about US$6 trillion over a 10-year period," Navarro said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's plans to unleash a wide range of reciprocal tariffs risk a global trade war, with other countries already vowing to retaliate and economists warning the sweeping moves risk stoking inflation and triggering a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has defended the levies as a way to raise government revenue and revitalize US industry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police plan to question a 56-year-old man on suspicion of starting at least one of the wildfires that recently devastated the country’s southern regions, killing 30 people and burning through more than 48,000 hectares.
 <br>
  <br>
  The North Gyeongsang provincial police department said the unidentified man may have used fire to clear overgrown grass at a family grave on a hill in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the areas hardest hit by the wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police investigators examined the grave site on Monday and plan to question the man soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police department did not immediately say whether others would also be questioned over suspected links to the wildfires, which fire officials believe may have been sparked by multiple human errors, also including burning trash and sparks from welding work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fueled by dry and windy conditions, the wildfires raged for a week, destroying thousands of homes, and leaving mountains covered in ash, before firefighters, aided by rain, brought them under control on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30 people killed were mostly in their 60s or older.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during firefighting efforts and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 45 people were injured, including nine seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires damaged or destroyed more than 6,000 structures, including over 1,000 homes each in the southeastern city of Andong and the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, as well as more than 330 homes in Uiseong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires in Uiseong damaged about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, said to have been originally built in the seventh century.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them were two state-designated “treasures,” a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668 and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers from China have found six survivors so far in earthquake-rattled Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The China Search and Rescue Team plucked to safety three women and a girl on Monday morning in Mandalay. One of the women is pregnant.
  <br>
  <br>
  That raised to six the number of survivors found by Chinese rescuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 91 personnel from five civilian emergency response forces organised by the Ministry of Emergency Management have arrived in Myanmar and have been taking part in rescue operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the first batch of disaster-relief material offered by Beijing arrived in Myanmar on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar said one Chinese national was killed and 15 other Chinese citizens were injured in Friday's tremor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy said the Chinese diplomatic missions in Myanmar have been assisting the families of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,700 people were killed in the quake. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    Trump 'not joking' about bid for third term

<img alt="Donald Trump chats with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, left, on board Marine One upon arrival at the White House on Sunday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798236_1_20250331125457.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said “I’m not joking” about trying to serve a third term, the clearest indication he is considering ways to breach a constitutional barrier against continuing to lead the country after his second term ends at the beginning of 2029.
 <br>
  <br>
  “There are methods which you could do it,” he said in a telephone interview on Sunday with NBC News from Mar-a-Lago, his private club.
  <br>
  <br>
  He elaborated later to reporters on Air Force One from Florida to Washington that "I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged.” Trump lost that election to Democrat Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Trump added: “I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, we’ve got a long time to go.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22nd amendment, added to the Constitution in 1951 after President Franklin D Roosevelt was elected four times in a row, says “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Any attempt to remain in office would be legally suspect and it is unclear how seriously Trump might pursue the idea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments nonetheless were an extraordinary reflection of the desire to maintain power by a president who had violated democratic traditions four years ago when he tried to overturn the election he lost to Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy," said a statement from Rep. Daniel Goldman, a New York Democrat who served as lead counsel for Trump's first impeachment. "If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump’s ambitions for a third term.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Bannon, a former Trump strategist who runs the right-wing “War Room” podcast, called for the president to run again during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kayla Thompson, a 30-year-old former paralegal in Wisconsin, said she would “absolutely” like Trump to serve another term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “America needs him. America is headed in the right direction and, if he doesn’t do it, we’re probably headed backwards," said Thompson, who was attending a campaign event on Sunday with Elon Musk in Green Bay for a state Supreme Court race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Boston’s Northeastern University, said "there are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NBC's Kristen Welker asked Trump if one potential avenue to a third term was having Vice President JD Vance run for the top job and “then pass the baton to you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, that’s one,” Trump responded. “But there are others too. There are others.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Can you tell me another?” Welker asked.
  <br>
  <br>
  “No,” Trump replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, noted that the 12th amendment, which was ratified in 1804, says “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Muller said that indicates that if Trump is not eligible to run for president again because of the 22nd amendment, he is not eligible to run for vice president, either.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked whether he would want to keep serving in “the toughest job in the country” at that point.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, I like working,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump suggested that Americans would go along with a third term because of his popularity. He falsely claimed to have “the highest poll numbers of any Republican for the last 100 years.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Gallup data shows President George W Bush reaching a 90 percent approval rating after the attacks on September 11, 2001. His father, President George H.W. Bush, hit 89 percent following the Gulf War in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has maxed out at 47 percent in Gallup data during his second term, despite claiming to be "in the high 70s in many polls, in the real polls.” (AP)

    Duterte lawyer insists ICC 'has no jurisdiction'

<img alt="Friends and relatives of some of the thousands killed during former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's 'war on drugs' call for justice and his conviction by the International Criminal Court in Manila on Friday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798229_1_20250331121432.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodrigo Duterte's lead lawyer said there was a "compelling" argument to throw out the International Criminal Court case against the former Philippines president before it even comes to trial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nicholas Kaufman said in an interview in The Hague he hoped to stop the case before the ICC confirms the charges against Duterte by arguing the court cannot exercise its jurisdiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Philippines' withdrawal from the court had become effective well before an investigation was authorised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte, 80, faces a charge of crimes against humanity for murder over his "war on drugs" that claimed the lives of thousands of mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  British-Israeli lawyer Kaufman, 56, said: "Coming back to the jurisdictional point, obviously you don't need to be the dean of a law faculty to realise that that's going to be a huge issue at pre-trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that the jurisdictional argument is compelling as defence counsel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that it should succeed and I would be hugely disappointed if it doesn't succeed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to persuade the judges pre-trial that it [the court] cannot exercise its jurisdiction over the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There won't be a confirmation-of-charges hearing if the judges rule in our favour."
  <br>
  <br>
  A confirmation of charges hearing, where prosecutor and defence first lay out their evidence, is currently scheduled for September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The issue of jurisdiction is key in this case as the Philippines withdrew from the ICC in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, when the court issued its arrest warrant for Duterte, it noted that the alleged crimes took place while the country was still an ICC member.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the alleged conduct has taken place between 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019 on the territory of the Philippines, it falls within the court's jurisdiction," the ICC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC chief prosecutor's application for his arrest said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population" in the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The families of victims of his war on drugs see the ICC case as a long-awaited chance for justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another likely critical issue for the defence will be Duterte's arrest on March 11 and his rapid handover to the ICC in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I view it as a kidnapping, nothing more or less. It's an extrajudicial rendition. He was given no due process, just slung over to the Hague," Kaufman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was in complete contravention of Philippines law."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president's sudden detention came amid a spectacular deterioration in relations between the two most powerful families in Philippines politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Duterte and Marcos clans teamed up to win an election landslide in 2022 that saw Ferdinand Marcos become president and Sara Duterte, daughter of the imprisoned Rodrigo, vice-president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte has since been impeached on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Duterte "should have been brought before a judge before he was thrown onto a plane and dumped in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That didn't happen. As I've said already, this is a political hit job," said Kaufman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The politics in that country basically ended up in a situation where they needed to get him out of the picture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incumbent government did not want him in the picture anymore."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaufman said he was visiting his client virtually every day in the ICC detention centre, a couple of kilometres from the beach in the suburb of Scheveningen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was "adjusting to the reality of prison life. That's not easy for anyone," according to his lawyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the former president was in "good spirits," said Kaufman, whose previous clients at ICC include former Congolese rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba and Aisha Kadhafi, daughter of the deceased Libyan dictator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaufman said he was concerned that the ICC, currently under fire from all sides and even US sanctions, would be reluctant to give up such a high-profile case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My only fear is that this court is starved of cases at the present moment and might be loath to let a case like that go, to slip through its hands." (AFP)

    Venezuela says high-level criminal among US deportees

<img alt="Repatriation flight with migrants deported from the US lands in at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798190_1_20250331090008.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelan authorities reported the arrival on Sunday of a new flight of 175 migrants expelled by the United States, including a gang leader - the first time Caracas has confirmed a criminal was among the deportees.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has launched a crackdown on migrants since coming to power in January, deporting hundreds of people to Latin America that his administration has branded as "gangsters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the first time in these flights... someone of weight arrives who has been claimed by the Venezuelan justice system," said Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that the man was "not from Tren de Aragua," referring to the Venezuelan gang that Washington branded a "foreign terrorist organisation" and claims many of the deported Venezuelan migrants belong to.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabello received the migrants at the Maiquetia International Airport that serves Caracas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He belongs to a gang from Trujillo state, the gang... El Cagon," Cabello added, without offering further details on the criminal's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabello said that of the migrants received by Venezuela so far, none were members of Tren de Aragua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela and the United States broke off diplomatic relations in 2019, but had a rapprochement in January to agree on deportation flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  That cooperation was interrupted for a month after Washington cracked down on Venezuela's oil sector, but flights resumed a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday's flight was the third to land since the resumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  In total, 918 people have arrived in Venezuela after being deported from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 553 migrants have returned from Mexico, although it was unclear whether they were originally deported from US soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the United Nations, almost eight million Venezuelans have left their country, fleeing an economic crisis that began to show signs of recovery in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government claims that more than 1.2 million have returned. (AFP)

    Starmer, Trump discuss possible US-UK trade deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Keir Starmer and Donald Trump spoke on Sunday and had "productive" talks towards a UK-US trade deal, the British Prime Minister's Downing Street office said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since Britain's exit from the European Union at the start of the decade, successive UK governments have sought to strike a trade deal with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They discussed the productive negotiations between their respective teams on a UK-US economic prosperity deal, agreeing that these will continue at pace this week," a statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They agreed to stay in touch in the coming days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump himself has dangled the prospect of a "great" deal that could help the United Kingdom avoid, or at least soften, the blow caused by the tariffs the US president has promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike the EU, Britain has declined to retaliate against the tariffs already imposed on the country's steel industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the previous Conservative government did not manage to ink a deal in, Labour party leader Starmer came away from a Washington visit in late February hopeful of reaching an agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK is believed to want a trade deal ahead of Trump's so-called April 2 "Liberation Day", when he is set to unveil a range of tariffs for different trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  But any such accord is yet to see the light of day. (AFP)

 The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Sunday that the Myanmar earthquake was a top-level emergency as it urgently sought US$8 million to save lives and prevent disease outbreaks over the next 30 days.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said the high numbers of casualties and trauma injuries were at high risk of infection due to limited surgical capacity in the country, while the underlying conditions in Myanmar meant the quake was likely to intensify the risk of disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  "WHO has classified this crisis as a Grade 3 emergency - the highest level of activation under its Emergency Response Framework," the United Nations health agency said in its flash appeal for funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial 7.7-magnitude quake struck near the central Myanmar city of Mandalay on Friday, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake has killed more than 1,700 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in neighbouring Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar, "preliminary assessments indicate high numbers of casualties and trauma-related injuries, with urgent needs for emergency care. Electricity and water supplies remain disrupted, worsening access to health services and heightening risks of waterborne and food-borne disease outbreaks," the WHO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trauma-related injuries - including fractures, open wounds, and crush syndrome - are at high risk of infection and complications due to limited surgical capacity and inadequate infection prevention and control."
  <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said hospitals were overwhelmed, while the scale of deaths, injuries and damage to health facilities "are not yet fully understood".
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said displacement into overcrowded shelters, combined with the destruction of water systems and sanitation infrastructure, had sharply increased the risk of communicable disease outbreaks. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Richard Chamberlain, the Emmy-nominated actor and 1960s heartthrob who rocketed to fame in the TV medical drama "Dr Kildare" and starred in the mini-series "Shogun" and "The Thorn Birds" has died at the age of 90, publicist Harlan Boll said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain died late on Saturday in Hawaii from complications from a stroke, he said in a statement on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain was an instant hit, and became a teen idol, as the handsome Dr James Kildare in the series that ran from 1961-1966. The Guardian newspaper said the then 27-year-old actor "looked like he had been sculpted by a loving god out of butter, honey and grace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The breakout role was the start of a six decade-career that spanned theatre, films and television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain was dubbed the "king of the mini-series" after appearing in several TV dramas in the 1980s and earned plaudits on stage in roles ranging from Professor Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady" and Captain von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" to Shakespeare's Hamlet and Richard II.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also was the original Jason Bourne in the 1988 mini-series "The Bourne Identity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "What's fascinating about Richard is that his range is enormous. His ability to be different each time out is what makes him such a valuable property," producer Susan Baerwald told the New York Times in 1988.
  <br>
  <br>
  The versatile actor was nominated for four Emmys -- as an English navigator in 17th century Japan in "Shogun" (1981), a love-torn priest in "The Thorn Birds" (1983), Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg in "Wallenberg: A Hero's Story" (1985) and for the title role in the 1975 TV movie "The Count of Monte-Cristo."
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of his roles were as romantic leading men, which is why he did not publicly reveal he was a homosexual until he was 68 years old. He feared it would ruin his career. For much of his life he said he pretended to be someone else. "When you grow up in the ’30s, ’40s and ’50s being gay, it's not only ain't easy, it's just impossible,” he told the New York Times in 2014. "I assumed there was something terribly wrong with me. And even becoming famous and all that, it was still there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain said it was a tremendous relief after he acknowledged his sexuality in his 2003 autobiography "Shattered Love: A Memoir."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had no fear left," he said in a 2019 interview. "It was a wonderful experience. People were open, friendly and sweet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born George Richard Chamberlain on March 31, 1934, in Los Angeles, he was the youngest of two sons. He had hoped to be an artist but switched to acting after attending Pomona College in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  His acting career was put on hold when he was drafted into the US Army in 1956 and served in Korea. After his discharge, Chamberlain returned to Los Angeles, where he co-founded a theatre group and had small parts on TV before becoming Dr Kildare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The success of the TV show led to a brief singing career and film roles opposite Julie Christie in "Petulia" (1968) and "The Madwoman of Chaillot" (1969) with Katherine Hepburn. He had a brief run in the musical "Breakfast at Tiffany's" with Mary Tyler Moore. The show closed after four previews.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the late 1960s, Chamberlain moved to England where he honed his acting skills in the BBC series "The Portrait of a Lady" and as Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dr Kildare was a huge hit in England, and I heard that all the London reviewers were coming to rip this interloper to pieces," he said in an interview. "But we got very good reviews."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain returned to the big screen as Lord Byron in the drama "Lady Caroline Lamb" (1972), "The Three Musketeers" (1973) and as a villain in the disaster film "The Towering Inferno" (1974).
  <br>
  <br>
  Throughout his career he mixed roles in Broadway plays, including Tennessee Williams' "The Night of the Iguana," with musicals, TV and films.
  <br>
  <br>
  After coming out publicly, he played both gay and straight characters in TV shows including "Brothers & Sisters," "Will & Grace" and "Desperate Housewives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The actor released a book of haiku poetry in 2012 and narrated Audubon environmental television specials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain lived in Hawaii for many years and had a three-decade relationship with actor and writer Martin Rabbett, his co-star in the 1986 adventure film "Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold." The couple parted in 2010 but remained close friends.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us. How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul," Rabbett said in a statement. (Reuters)

    Trump threatens Iran with bombings and tariffs

<img alt="In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said US and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798156_2_20250331075407.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with bombings and secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said US and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing," Trump said. "But there's a chance that if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's language represented a sharpening of his comment a few days earlier that if Tehran refused to negotiate a new nuclear agreement, "bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran."
  <br>
  <br>
  Western powers accuse Iran of having an clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran says its nuclear programme is wholly for civilian energy purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump in 2018 pulled the United States out of an agreement to relieve sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, in his second term, he has said he is open to talks on a new deal that could reduce the risk of military escalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump revealed in early March that he had sent a letter proposing such talks to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran, deeply suspicious of the US administration after Trump's withdrawal from the original nuclear deal, has refused to negotiate directly with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the official IRNA news agency that he had delivered a letter responding to Trump's outreach to Oman, which has served as an intermediary in the past. (Agencies)

<img alt="This building in Mandalay is among those that collapsed in Friday's killer earthquake. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798150_1_20250330223525.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The toll from Myanmar's earthquake continued to rise on Sunday, as foreign rescue teams and aid rushed into the country where hospitals were overwhelmed and some communities scrambled to mount rescue efforts with limited resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar's strongest in a century, struck on Friday, leaving around 1,700 people dead, 3,400 injured and over 300 missing as of Sunday, the military government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, warned that the number of fatalities could go up and his administration faced a challenging situation, state media reported, three days after he made a rare call for international assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  India, China and Thailand are among Myanmar's neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The destruction has been extensive, and humanitarian needs are growing by the hour," the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With temperatures rising and the monsoon season approaching in just weeks, there is an urgent need to stabilise affected communities before secondary crises emerge."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States pledged US$2 million in aid "through Myanmar-based humanitarian assistance organisations" and said in a statement that an emergency response team from USAID, which is undergoing massive cuts under the Trump administration, is deploying to Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critical infrastructure – including bridges, highways, airports and railways – across the country of 55 million lie damaged, slowing humanitarian efforts while the conflict that has battered the economy, displaced over 3.5 million people and debilitated the health system rages on.
  <br>
  <br>
  In some areas near the epicentre, residents said government assistance was scarce, leaving people to fend for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is necessary to restore the transportation routes as soon as possible," Min Aung Hlaing told officials on Saturday, according to state media. "It is necessary to fix the railways and also reopen the airports so that rescue operations would be more effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Service's predictive modelling estimated Myanmar's death toll could eventually top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country's annual economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including the second-biggest city, Mandalay, and the capital Naypyitaw, were struggling to cope with an influx of injured people, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake also shook parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 18 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 76 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed Bangkok building, where rescue operations continued for a third day, using drones and sniffer dogs to hunt for survivors. (Reuters)

    Protesters target Tesla in anti-Musk campaign

<img alt="Protesters hold up signs outside a Tesla dealership in Michigan. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798089_1_20250330101458.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Demonstrators descended on Tesla dealerships across the United States and in Europe and Canada on Saturday to protest company chief Elon Musk, who has amassed extraordinary power as a top advisor to US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Waving signs with messages like "Musk is stealing our money" and "Reclaim our country," the protests largely took place peacefully following fiery episodes of vandalism on Teslas in recent weeks that US officials have denounced as "terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds rallied Saturday outside the Tesla dealership in New York's Manhattan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some blasted Musk, the world's richest man, while others demanded the shuttering of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is dramatically slashing the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amy Neifeld, a 70-year-old psychologist who had not joined a protest since marching against the Vietnam War in the 1970s, accused Musk of leading the country toward fascism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm Jewish, so I grew up with a great awareness of fascism," she told AFP. "And it has just gotten uglier and uglier" since Trump returned to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He acts like he's the vice president," said New York protester Eva Mueller of musk. "He's dismantling, actively, our government, he's dismantling our democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The protest was organized by the environmental activist group Planet Over Profit, which argues "stopping Musk will help save lives and protect our democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington's posh Georgetown neighbourhood, some 150 people gathered in a festive mood on an unseasonably warm day, dancing and cheering as passing cars honked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests also took place in Florida, Massachusetts and California, as well as in in European cities such as London, Berlin and Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Canada's Vancouver, where around one hundred people protested at a Tesla dealership, one person in a dinosaur costume held a placard that said, "You thought the Nazis were extinct? Don't buy a Swasticar."
  <br>
  <br>
  A small group of Americans held signs outside a Tesla dealership in the French capital, including one that read "Send Musk to Mars now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and Trump "are destroying our democracy, not obeying the basic rules of our country, and firing people at agencies that do very important work," said Raf, 59, a Paris protester who did not wish to give his last name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for reaction to the protests, Tesla did not immediately respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acts of vandalism against Tesla vehicles, dealerships and other facilities have spread for weeks, in protest both against Musk's ruthless job-cutting work, and what has been seen as his unwelcome interference in politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Attorney General Pam Bondi has denounced the attacks on Tesla as "domestic terrorism." (AFP)

    Mexico brings in junk food ban

<img alt="A man walks past a sign that refers to the labelling of products, in the subway of Mexico City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798081_1_20250330075336.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world’s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The health guidelines, first published last fall , take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavoured peanuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: “Farewell, junk food!” And it encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexico's ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogramme the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic .
  <br>
  <br>
  In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , has vowed to upend the nation's food system and “ Make America Healthy Again " by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labelling system in 2020 .
  <br>
  <br>
  Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,” said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum , who has championed the effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexico’s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to Unicef, which classifies the nation’s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40 percent of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from US$545 to US$5,450.
  <br>
  <br>
  But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico’s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains and even reliable internet and electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends. (AP)

 Japanese restaurant chain Sukiya will temporarily shut nearly all of its roughly 2,000 branches after a rat was found in a miso soup and a bug was found in another meal, the company said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sukiya, famous for its beef bowls, apologised in a statement saying a bug contamination at one of its Tokyo restaurants on Friday, two months after the rat incident at another branch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sukiya has decided to temporarily close all restaurants, with the exception of some stores in shopping centres, from March 31 to April 4 in order to take measures against pests and vermin," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fast-food company has about 1,970 stores across Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nikkei business daily reported that its stores in shopping centres will also be closed as soon as arrangements are made with the facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Food recalls are rare in Japan, a country with famously high sanitation standards, but food poisoning and recall incidents occasionally make headlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, more than 100,000 packets of sliced bread were recalled after parts of a rat were discovered inside two bags. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean firefighters deployed helicopters on Saturday as the country's biggest wildfires on record that ravaged wide areas of its southeast reignited in one of the region's cities, an official said.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen fires have been fanned by high winds and dry conditions, killing 30 people and injuring dozens more in southeastern regions, an interior ministry official said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fires were whipped up again early on Saturday in Andong, a city in the worst-hit North Gyeongsang province, forcing authorities to deploy eight helicopters to the area, said an official from the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came a day after the main fire in the province, where 26 of the 30 victims have died, was extinguished.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems that the remaining embers have flared up a bit," said the official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We plan to deploy more helicopters to the area in Andong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires there began on Saturday last week and rolled on for days.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 2,900 homes in the region have been completely destroyed, according to the latest figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official said this week that more than 35,000 hectares (86,500 acres) of forest have been burned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire also destroyed several historic sites, including the Gounsa temple complex in the southeastern city of Uiseong, which is believed to have been originally built in the 7th century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extent of the damage makes it South Korea's largest-ever wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Saturday, an official from the North Gyeongsang provincial government said helicopters were still being deployed in Andong areas to extinguish mostly small flames and smoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the size of the area, it may take some time to complete all operations and fully extinguish the fires," said Do Gyu-myeong .
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the victims in the region were elderly, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those killed include a pilot in his 70s whose helicopter crashed on Wednesday while he was trying to contain a fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flames have been fanned by high winds and ultra-dry conditions, with the area experiencing below-average rains for months after South Korea had its hottest year on record in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said the wildfires were accidentally started by a grave visitor and "sparks from a brush cutter."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Hye-young, a 65-year-old resident of Andong, said she still remains traumatised by the experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was really scary to see the sparks flying around all at once," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While living in North Gyeongsang, I never thought that such a large disaster would strike us." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from the massive earthquake in Myanmar has passed 1,600, the ruling junta there said on Saturday, with more than 3,400 injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the junta's information team said 1,644 people are known to have died in Friday's shallow 7.7-magnitude quake, with 3,408 injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has extended condolences to Myanmar's leader, and a rescue team from Yunnan Province – that borders Myanmar – arrived on Saturday morning at Yangon in Myanmar to provide assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said the only highway linking Myanmar's Yangon in the south and central Naypyidaw and Mandalay was severely damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar in the early afternoon on Friday, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake destroyed buildings, downed bridges, and buckled roads across swathes of Myanmar, with severe damage reported in the second-biggest city, Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 10 more deaths have so far been confirmed in Bangkok, where rescuers laboured through the night searching for workers trapped when a 30-storey skyscraper under construction collapsed, reduced in seconds to a pile of rubble and twisted metal by the force of the shaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the biggest quake to hit Myanmar in over a century, according to US geologists, and the tremors were powerful enough to severely damage buildings across Bangkok, hundreds of kilometres away from the epicentre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to 100 workers were still unaccounted for at the building, close to the Chatuchak weekend market that is a magnet for tourists. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An original animatronic model of the iconic alien created for Steven Spielberg's classic 1982 film "ET the Extra-Terrestrial" is for sale at Sotheby's and is estimated to fetch as much as US$900,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Created by Oscar-winning special effects artist Carlo Rambaldi, the model is one of three used in the film and is specifically the one featured in the closet scene when ET is hiding among loads of stuffed animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The model - which stands 91.4 centimetres tall, according to Sotheby's listing - is from the personal collection of Rambaldi, an animatronics pioneer who died in 2012.
  <br>
  <br>
  The starting bid is US$500,000 in the online sale, which closes on April 3. The estimated price is from US$600,000 to US$900,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This model embodies the artistry of an era before CGI took hold, a nostalgic and iconic piece of Hollywood history as captivating as the stories themselves," said Cassandra Hatton, a Sotheby's vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ET model was able to perform 150 different movements, such as frowning or stretching his neck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rambaldi collaborated on other blockbuster sci-fi films including Spielberg's "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (1977), Ridley Scott's "Alien" (1979) and John Guillermin's "King Kong" (1976).
  <br>
  <br>
  The auction includes other objects from the Italian artist's collection, including two of the model sandworms used in David Lynch's "Dune." (AFP)

    Trump, Carney hail 'extremely productive' call

<img alt="During the call, Carney told Trump his government would impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods from April 2. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797975_1_20250329071156.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said he had an "extremely productive" first call Friday with Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney, after soaring tensions over tariffs and Trump's wish to annex his northern neighbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump added that the two planned to meet soon after Canada's April 28 general election in which Carney - who took office two weeks ago - has made standing up to the US president the focus of his campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just finished speaking with Prime Minister Mark Carney, of Canada. It was an extremely productive call, we agree on many things," Trump said on his Truth Social network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Typically, a new Canadian leader makes a phone call with the US president an immediate priority, but this was Trump and Carney's first contact since the Canadian was sworn in on March 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's office said the pair had a "very constructive conversation" and agreed to begin "comprehensive negotiations about a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added, however, that Carney told Trump his government would impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods from April 2, when sweeping US levies are set to come into place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're not going to back down, we're going to respond with force," Carney said at an afternoon press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What is clear is that the relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. And we're not the one's who changed," he added, confirming that Canada needed to look to Europe "to strengthen ties with reliable partners."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the coming weeks, months and years, we must fundamentally reimagine our economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's glowing post was still a dramatic change in tone from recent rhetoric between Washington and Ottawa, who are Nato allies and long-standing economic partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has sparked fury in Canada by repeatedly insisting it should become the 51st US state and by slapping or threatening tariffs on the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  His post on Friday was notable for its diplomacy, as Trump gave Carney his official title of prime minister and made no reference to his annexation drive. (AFP)

    Vance accuses Denmark of underinvesting in Greenland

<img alt="US Vice President JD Vance demanded Denmark change its approach as President Trump pushes to take over the Danish territory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797969_1_20250329062730.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance accused Denmark on Friday of not having done enough to protect Greenland when he visited the resource-rich Danish territory coveted by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vance made his comment during a trip to the Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, a visit viewed by Copenhagen and Nuuk as a provocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our message to Denmark is basic: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland," Vance told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump argues that the United States needs the vast Arctic island for national and international security and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not talking about peace for the United States. We are talking about world peace. We are talking about international security," Trump claimed to reporters at the White House on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the potential use of force, Vance stressed that the US administration did not think it was "ever going to be necessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen hit back at Vance in a statement to Danish media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For many years, we have stood by the Americans in very difficult situations," she said, referring to Danish combat deployments alongside American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Vice President's reference to Denmark is not accurate," she said, expressing her readiness to "cooperate day and night with the Americans" on Arctic security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance was accompanied by his wife, Usha; National Security Advisor Mike Waltz; Energy Secretary Chris Wright; Utah Senator Mike Lee; and former Homeland Security Advisor Julia Nesheiwat, who is Waltz's wife.
  <br>
  <br>
  A majority of Greenlanders oppose US annexation, according to a January poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's desire to take over the ice-covered territory, which is seeking independence from Denmark, has been categorically rejected by Greenlanders, their politicians and Danish officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  While all of Greenland's political parties favour independence, none of them support the idea of becoming part of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new broad four-party coalition government was announced in Greenland just hours before the US delegation's arrival, following elections earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Incoming prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said the territory needed unity at this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is critical that we put aside our disagreements and differences... because only in this way will we be able to cope with the heavy pressure we are exposed to from outside," he said when he unveiled his government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nielsen said that by visiting Greenland when there was no government in office there, the US administration was "not showing respect to an ally". (AFP)

 The earthquake in Myanmar was felt in China's Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and caused injuries and damage to houses in the city of Ruili on the border with northern Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Videos that one outlet said it had received from a person in Ruili showed building debris littering a street and a person being wheeled on a stretcher toward an ambulance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shaking in Mangshi, a Chinese city about 100 kilometres northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people couldn’t stand, one resident told The Paper, an online media outlet. (AP)

 Myanmar's ruling junta made a rare request for international humanitarian aid and declared a state of emergency across six regions after a powerful quake hit the country on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing was seen arriving at a hospital in Naypyidaw where wounded were being treated after the quake hit central Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a response, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it was ready to offer "all possible assistance" to Myanmar and Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Praying for the safety and wellbeing of everyone," Modi wrote on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "India stands ready to offer all possible assistance. In this regard, asked our authorities to be on standby." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A major hospital in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw is a "mass casualty area" after the country was rocked by a huge earthquake, an official at the facility said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rows of wounded were treated outside the emergency department of the 1,000-bed general hospital, some writhing in pain, others lying still as relatives sought to comfort them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The entrance of the emergency department at the city's main hospital pancaked onto a car.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hospital official said that "this is a mass casualty area."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another official said hundreds of injured people had arrived at the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't seen [anything] like this before," a doctor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are trying to handle the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so exhausted now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The route to the hospital was jammed with vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ambulance tried to make its way through, a paramedic shouting "cars, move aside so the ambulance can get through."
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake damaged religious shrines, sending parts and some homes toppling to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the National Museum in Yangon, pieces fell from the ceiling as the building began shaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uniformed staff ran outside, some trembling and tearful, others grabbing cellphones to try to contact loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of the former royal palace and buildings were damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the area is prone to earthquakes, it is generally sparsely populated, and most houses are low-rise structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Sagaing region just southwest of Mandalay, the 90-year-old Ava Bridge collapsed, and some sections of the highway connecting Mandalay and Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, were also damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents in Yangon rushed out of their homes when the quake struck. There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A strong 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit central Myanmar on Friday, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said, buckling roads in the capital Naypyidaw and with tremors felt in China and Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok police say a 30-storey building under construction for government offices collapsed when the earthquake hit around midday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medics say at least 43 workers are trapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic video circulating on social media showed the multi-storey building with a crane on top collapsing into a cloud of dust, while onlookers screamed and ran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were responding to the collapse, which happened near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak Market, but had no immediate information on how many workers were on the site at the time of the collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tremor's epicentre was located 16 kilometres northwest of the city of Sagaing at a depth of 10 kilometres around 12:50 pm, the USGS said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some metro and light rail services were suspended in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's stock exchange said on it is on "full halt."
  <br>
  <br>
  The midday temblor was followed by a strong 6.4 magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roads were buckled by the force of the tremors and chunks of ceilings fell from buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt through northern Thailand and down to the capital Bangkok, where residents ran into the streets as buildings shook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I heard it and I was sleeping in the house, I ran as far as I could in my pyjamas out of the building," said Duangjai, a resident of the popular northern tourist city Chiang Mai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt in Yunnan province, according to Beijing's quake agency, which said the jolt measured 7.9 in magnitude. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's junta chief Min Aung Hlaing will join a regional leaders' summit in Thailand next week where he is seeking high-level bilateral meetings, said three sources with direct knowledge, in a rare visit to a Southeast Asian country since seizing power in coup that led to a civil war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Min Aung Hlaing is the subject of widespread western sanctions and is barred from attending summits of the Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN due to the Myanmar military's failure to implement an agreed peace plan with the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will join the April 3-4 summit in Bangkok of the BIMSTEC grouping of mostly South Asian countries, where the Myanmar delegation is seeking bilateral meetings with leaders and top officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meetings being sought include ones with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of Bangladesh’s interim government, Muhammed Yunus, the sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have been reaching out asking for meetings," one of the sources said, referring to Myanmar officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar has been in crisis since the military overthrew the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking mass protests that escalated into an armed rebellion against the junta.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a third of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta chief said on Thursday said an election would be held in December, promising a free and fair vote and to transfer state power to the winning party. (Reuters)

    Rallies set as Duterte marks 80th birthday in prison

<img alt="Relatives of drug war and extrajudicial killing victims in Quezon City watch a live telecast of the initial appearance of Rodrigo Duterte at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797846_1_20250328130849.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Family and supporters of former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte will rally on Friday to mark his 80th birthday and protest his detention in The Hague on a charge of crimes against humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Duterte could spend the rest of his life in jail if convicted at the International Criminal Court (ICC) of the charge tied to his "war on drugs" in which thousands were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters are planning more than 200 simultaneous birthday rallies demanding his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, his eldest daughter, has been in the Dutch city for more than two weeks helping assemble his legal team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another of the ex-president's daughters, 20-year-old Veronica as well as her mother, Cielito Avancena, said they failed to get inside the prison to see him on Wednesday – but remained hopeful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will make sure I get to see him," Veronica told a Philippine television network outside the ICC detention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another of the ex-president's sons is expected, as well as his ex-wife Elizabeth Zimmerman, according to Sara Duterte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC chief prosecutor's application for his arrest said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population" in the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's arrest on March 11 and rapid handover to the international tribunal came on the heels of his family's bitter falling out with his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cracks began to appear in their alliance soon after Marcos teamed up with Sara Duterte to sweep the presidential and vice presidential elections in May 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president quit her cabinet post as education secretary after being denied the defence portfolio, while Duterte himself began calling Marcos a drug addict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Sara Duterte was impeached by a pro-Marcos House of Representatives on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outcome of her Senate trial will likely depend on the number of seats her allies win in May 12 mid-term elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of her party's candidates, former Philippine police chief and drug war enforcer Ronald Dela Rosa, says he expects to be arrested by the ICC next.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ex-president faces a six-month wait inside the United Nations' Scheveningen prison before his next scheduled court appearance on September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is only allowed two visits per day – a lawyer and a family member, said the vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I urged him to write a book and then when you get out, we'll sell it and make money out of it," she said. (AFP)

    Rubio says too early for high-level Russia talks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned on Thursday it was premature to expect high-level talks with Russia, while the United States weighs Moscow's response to Washington's efforts to end the Ukraine war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Asked by a reporter if it was time for higher-level talks after indirect US negotiations with the two sides in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said: "I think you have to make more progress on a technical level."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of work to be done with both sides, particularly with the Russian side, which we haven't talked to for years," Rubio said on his plane to his home city of Miami from a three-nation Caribbean tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  On how long it would take to make progress, Rubio said, "I just can't put a timeframe on that because it doesn't depend on us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said US President Donald Trump's administration would hold consultations to discuss the outcome of the meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has repeatedly said he hopes to meet soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin, likely in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States announced on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine had agreed to hold fire in strikes on the Black Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Russia later said it had conditions, as it seeks relief from the sweeping sanctions imposed by the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio had earlier called on Russia to accept unconditionally a Ukrainian-backed proposal for a 30-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron has rejected Russian calls for an easing of Western sanctions, saying it was far too early and more progress was needed. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Marco Rubio bluntly warned Venezuela against attacking its oil-rich neighbour Guyana, brandishing the power of the US military to protect the small South American nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela, whose leftist leader Nicolas Maduro is despised by the Cuban-American Rubio, has increasingly pushed its claim to the disputed Essequibo region controlled by Guyana, and was accused this month of making an incursion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have full confidence saying it now as secretary of state – there will be consequences for adventurism. There will be consequences for aggressive action," Rubio said in Guyana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what the United States would do if Venezuela attacked ExxonMobil oil projects in Guyana, Rubio said: "It would be a very bad day -- a very bad week for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stopping short of spelling out a military response, Rubio said: "We have a big navy, and it can get almost anywhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Maduro responded angrily to the threat, calling Rubio an "imbecile" and saying "no one threatens Venezuela."
  <br>
  <br>
  While in Guyana, Rubio signed an agreement to boost security cooperation with the country including through greater information sharing. It comes years after Guyana and the United States agreed to joint maritime patrols.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyanese President Irfaan Ali welcomed the stance of Rubio, who called Venezuela's claims "illegitimate."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very pleased at the reassurance of the US, ensuring the safeguard of our territorial integrity and sovereignty," Ali said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement on Telegram, said his country did "not need nor seek conflicts, but neither will we allow foreign interests to try to rewrite the reality about our Essequibo."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get your noses out of this dispute!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyana, an English-speaking former British and Dutch colony where the majority of the 800,000 people still live in poverty, has for years had a long-shot movement that has sought to join the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such formal accession was not on the agenda, but Trump has made no secret of his passion for expansionism in the Western Hemisphere, even at the expense of traditional alliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Exxon has dominated the oil industry, China has made rapid inroads in Guyana with infrastructure projects including an expansion of the international airport where Rubio landed. (AFP)

<img alt="Donald Trump with US Representative Elise Stefanik last year. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797812_1_20250328104043.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump withdrew right-wing firebrand Elise Stefanik as his nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations as Republicans fear for their narrow majority in Congress.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New York congresswoman is just the second Trump cabinet pick not to go through, after Matt Gaetz pulled out of the running to be attorney general following allegations of sexual misconduct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik is a vocal Trump ally and pro-Israel stalwart.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat" in the House of Representatives, Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said it was "essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had asked Stefanik to stay in Congress and "rejoin the House leadership team," although he did not say in what capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans won both the House and Senate in the November 2024 election that returned Trump to the White House, but they have a very tight lead in the lower chamber.
  <br>
  <br>
  They control the House by 218 seats to 213, giving them just a tiny margin and making it difficult to pass key legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two crucial special elections will be held in Florida on April 1 to fill the seats vacated by Mike Waltz, who is now Trump's national security advisor, and Gaetz.
  <br>
  <br>
  While both Republicans comfortably won the seats in November, polling in one of the districts has shown the Democratic candidate closing the gap considerably.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump himself has leaned into the races, with an appearance Thursday at a candidate's online event seen as evidence that Republicans are worried.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those concerns were further heightened on Tuesday, when a special election for Pennsylvania's state senate saw Democrats flip a district that Trump won handily last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik has effectively been in limbo since Trump's nomination, keeping her place in the House for a number of key votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A firebrand who was considered a moderate before the Trump era, Stefanik is seen as one of the most vocal supporters in Congress of both Israel and US Jewish causes. (AFP)

    Light rain aids firefighters in South Korea

<div class="itemFullText">
 Light rain offered some relief to South Korean authorities tackling the country's worst wildfires on record, with exhausted firefighters making another push on Friday to contain blazes stretching 70 km.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 28 people have died and more than 45,000 hectares of largely forest land in the country's southeast have been charred or are burning, as strong winds have driven blazes from central Uiseong county to coastal regions over the past week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uiseong reported fires had been put out in 95 percent of the area as of early Friday, and flames in 85 percent of the neighbouring Andong city, which is home to UNESCO World Heritage sites, have been doused, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeongdeok county on the east coast, where the fire spread from the initial blaze more than 70 km away in under 12 hours, was still fighting to contain the flames, with nearly a third of the area still ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rain of less than 3 mm fell in some parts of the regions on Thursday and had offered "a little help," forest service spokesman Kim Jong-gun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters and helicopters were taking advantage of more favourable weather and better visibility to make a push to make more progress before winds are expected to pick up later on Friday, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blazes that began in Uiseong have become the biggest single forest fire in South Korea's history, destroying an area equivalent to about two-thirds of the island of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 80 helicopters started flying at daybreak on Friday to dump water, the safety ministry said. A helicopter pilot died on Wednesday after crashing while trying to tackle a blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wildfires have displaced more than 30,000 residents, many of whom are elderly, and ravaged everything in their path, including historic temples and homes, in the mountainous forest regions of North Gyeongsang province. (Reuters)

<img alt="A polar bear is seen on ice floes in the Franz Josef Land archipelago in 2021. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797792_1_20250328084339.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arctic sea ice had its weakest winter buildup since record-keeping began 47 years ago, a symptom of climate change that will have repercussions globally, scientists said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Arctic reaches its maximum sea ice in March each year and then starts a six-month melt season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Snow and Ice Data Centre said the peak measurement taken on Saturday was 14.33 million square kilometres - about 80,000 square kilometres smaller than the lowest previous peak in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Warming temperatures are what’s causing the ice to decline,'' ice data scientist Walt Meier said. “You know, sea ice in particular is very sensitive... 31 degrees is ice skating and 33 degrees it’s swimming.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists said warming conditions in the Arctic - the region is warming four times faster than the rest of the world - affect weather elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The warming winter atmosphere above the Arctic Circle does impact large-scale weather patterns that do influence those of us outside the Arctic,” said Julienne Stroeve, an ice scientist at the University of Manitoba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the smaller sea ice, Stroeve noted that not only was there less of it, the remaining ice was thin enough for more of it to melt quickly this summer. She cautioned that a record low area in the winter didn't guarantee a record small area in the summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Melting Arctic sea ice - mostly in the summer - is making the polar bear population smaller, weaker and hungrier because they rely on the sea ice to hunt from, scientists said. And winter sea ice is especially important for fisheries and seal pups, Meier said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arctic sea ice's biggest year since record-keeping began was 1979, at 16.64 million square kilometres. That means since satellites began tracking it, Arctic sea ice's winter peak has shrunk by about the size of Pakistan. (AP)

    Australian PM calls general election for May 3

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia will hold a general election on May 3, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday, locking in a showdown over climate action, nuclear power and a runaway housing market.
 <br>
  <br>
  Albanese's centre-left Labour party took office in May 2022, turfing out a conservative government deeply unpopular after almost a decade in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  But initial enthusiasm for Albanese, 62, has evaporated in recent months as the government nears the end of its three-year term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls show him neck-and-neck with right-leaning Peter Dutton, 54, a hard-nosed former detective who wants to cut back on immigration and reverse a ban on nuclear power.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the last few years, the world has thrown a lot at Australia in uncertain times," the prime minister told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because of the strength and resilience that our people have shown, Australia is turning the corner. Now, on May 3, you choose the way forward."
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese declared he was "born ready" to deal with climate challenges, tariff turmoil and the long tail of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he warned any foreign foes intent on meddling in the election campaign to "back off".
  <br>
  <br>
  Coal mining-superpower Australia will choose between two candidates with sharply contrasting ideas on climate change and emissions reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese's government has embraced the global push towards decarbonisation, warning of a future in which iron ore and polluting coal exports no longer prop up the economy. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday he would call a general election "imminently," with local media reporting the poll would be held on May 3.
 <br>
  <br>
  Albanese's left-leaning Labor government is nearing the end of its three-year term and must hold an election by May 17 at the latest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recent polls show the government is neck-and-neck with its conservative rivals, who were turfed out in 2022 after almost a decade in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  As speculation mounted on Thursday, Albanese said he was preparing to call the election "soon."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be called pretty imminently," he told a local radio station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Multiple media outlets – including national broadcaster ABC – reported Albanese would announce the official start of campaigning on Friday, setting an election date of May 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 62-year-old's government released its annual budget this week, courting votes with surprise tax cuts and a raft of other sweeteners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conservative leader Peter Dutton, 54, has pilloried Albanese, accusing him of "weak" leadership and stoking inflation through government largesse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutton's signature policy is a US$200 billion scheme to construct seven industrial-scale nuclear reactors, putting the brakes on the growth of renewable energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polling shows economic concerns and the high cost of housing will dominate the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although inflation has eased under Albanese – from 7.8 percent in 2022 to 2.4 percent in December – many households are still struggling with high food, fuel, and power prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major cities Sydney and Melbourne now rank among the 10 least-affordable housing markets in the world, according to the annual Demographia affordability index. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China warned on Thursday a trade war would have "no winners" after US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent import tariffs on foreign-made cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariffs won't help Washington solve its own problems, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China also rebuffed a suggestion from Trump that he might offer to reduce tariffs on the country to get Beijing's approval for the sale of popular social media platform TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said its position on the tariff issue is consistent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said China is willing to engage with Washington on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok's parent ByteDance has to find a non-Chinese buyer of the short video app used by 170 million Americans by April 5 or face a US ban on national security grounds. (AFP/Reuters)

 Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said it plans to set incentives for London's Heathrow to invest in its operations and provide high-quality service as part of the regulator's periodic review, days after a closure at the airport rocked airlines.
 <br>
  <br>
  The review and guidance look into several aspects of how Heathrow, a major global travel hub, functions and develops: from investments, to airline charges, to environmental impact, and preparedness to handle a crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said on Thursday that under its latest regulatory review that would look into operations from 2027 to 2031, the CAA would also "carefully consider the rules on resilience after the closure of Heathrow Airport on 21 March 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow Airport was closed for all of last Friday after a huge fire at a nearby electrical substation wiped out its power, disrupting flight schedules around the world. (Reuters)

 South Korea's auto sector is expected to face "considerable difficulties" when US import tariffs on cars announced by President Donald Trump take effect and the government plans an emergency response by April, the industry minister said.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea will also actively engage the US government to explore measures to minimise the negative impact on South Korea's auto companies and suppliers, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun said in a meeting with industry officials on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Global uncertainties are growing but South Korean auto companies will not be fighting alone," Ahn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will consider financial assistance, investment support, and help with market diversification, he said, adding that parts suppliers are expected to be hit particularly hard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles sparked criticism and threats of retaliation from countries affected by the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in South Korea's Hyundai Motor shed more than 4 percent and sister automaker Kia Corp fell more than 3 percent. Hyundai Motor shares are set to post their biggest daily drop since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai together with affiliate Kia is the world's third-largest automaker by sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, South Korea's exports of automobiles to the United States stood at US$34.7 billion, accounting for 49 percent of its total auto exports. (Reuters)

    Thais give green light to draft law for casinos

<img alt="Protesters rally near Government House in Bangkok against the casino-entertainment complex bill. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797665_1_20250327133509.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's cabinet on Thursday approved a draft law for casinos and entertainment complexes, as the government looks to attract more tourists and build a major gaming industry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gambling is mostly banned in Thailand apart from state-controlled horse racing, the lottery and on some sports but successive governments have pressed the case for allowing casinos to draw in more foreign visitors and create more jobs and state revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the latest draft approved by cabinet will significantly limit how many Thai punters can go to casinos, with an entry fee of 5,000 baht and proof of at least 50 million baht in bank deposits, effectively blocking large swathes of the population, where per capita gross domestic product is about US$7,300.
  <br>
  <br>
  A deputy finance minister said this month the assets requirement for Thai nationals would be dropped because it would exclude too many people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another restriction is that the casino area may only occupy up to 10 percent of the entire space of an entertainment complex, according to a government statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draft law will be sent to parliament, and if passed, will also need approval from the Senate and the king.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said details of the law were not final as parliament would have the final say.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Citi report late last year estimated that about half of people aged 20 and more in Thailand could be casino players, providing a base for the country to potentially become the world's third-largest gambling destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government, led by the populist Pheu Thai party, hopes to attract at least 100 billion baht in new investment in casinos and entertainment complexes and see an annual boost to foreign arrivals of 5 to 10 percent, while generating revenue of more than 12 billion baht a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite most betting and gambling being outlawed in Thailand, illicit operations have operated for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  A January opinion poll in Thailand indicated there was opposition to the plan, however, and some political parties have argued that building a gambling industry would worsen social problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several countries in Southeast Asia have legalised casinos, but only a few like Singapore has been successful in drawing global giants such as Las Vegas Sands Corp on the back of robust regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism is a key driver of Thailand, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the government expects 38 million foreign arrivals, closing in on its pre-pandemic record of nearly 40 million tourists. (Reuters)

    Japan warns of 'significant impact' of US tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's government on Thursday warned of a "significant impact" on its economic ties with the United States -- and on global trade -- after US President Donald Trump announced import tariffs on cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo is a close economic and strategic US ally, with its firms the biggest investors in the United States and one in 10 Japanese jobs are connected to the auto sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced on Wednesday 25 percent tariffs "on all cars that are not made in the United States" effective 12.01am eastern time on April 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who last month held friendly talks with Trump at the White House, said Japan was reviewing an "appropriate" response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan has made significant investments and significant job creation, which doesn't apply to all countries... we are the number one (country) in investment in the United States," Ishiba added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US president's understanding on this is significantly deepening. However, various things are happening, so we are considering all kinds of countermeasures," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi went further, calling the tariffs "extremely regrettable" and warning of major effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that the current measures and other broad-based trade restrictions by the US government could have a significant impact on the economic relationship between Japan and the US, as well as on the global economy and the multilateral trading system," Hayashi told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response to this announcement, we have again told the US government that this measure was extremely regrettable and we strongly urged the US government to exclude Japan from the scope of this measure," Hayashi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's announcement hammered carmakers in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's top-selling automaker Toyota at midday was down 2.7 percent, while Nissan shed 2.6 percent and Honda was off 2.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In South Korea, Hyundai shares dipped 4.0 percent. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildfires raging in South Korea doubled in size on Thursday from a day earlier, as authorities called the blazes the country's worst natural fire disaster with at least 26 people killed and historic temples incinerated.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 33,000 hectares has been charred or were still burning in the largest of the fires that began in the central Uiseong county, making it the biggest single forest fire in South Korea's history. The previous record was 24,000 hectares in a March 2000 fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are nationally in a critical situation with numerous casualties because of the unprecedented rapid spread of forest fires," Acting President Han Duck-soo told a government response meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military has released stocks of aviation fuel to help keep firefighting helicopters flying to douse flames across mountainous regions in the southeast of the country where fires have been burning now for nearly a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 120 helicopters have been deployed in three regions battling the blazes, the safety ministry said. South Korea relies on helicopters to fight forest fires because of its mountainous terrain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wildfires that originated in Uiseong have been moving rapidly eastward, spreading almost to the coast, carried by gusty winds and with dry conditions aggravating the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the meteorological agency has forecast some rain for the southwest, precipitation is expected to be under five millimetres for most of the affected areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount of rain is going to be small so it doesn't look like it'll be big help in trying to extinguish the fire," Korea Forest Service Minister Lim Sang-seop told a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have said the Uiseong fire showed extremely unusual spread in terms of its scale and speed, and that climate change is expected to make wildfires more frequent and deadly globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Higher temperatures amplified by human-caused climate change contributed to the existing seasonally dry conditions, "turning dry landscapes into dangerous fire fuel" in the region, the Climate Central group, an independent body made up of scientists and researchers, said in a report. (Reuters)

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet top French diplomat Jean-Noel Barrot on Thursday for talks on topics like the war in Ukraine and trade between China and the European Union.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has said it hopes this week's visit by the French foreign minister would see the countries deepen cooperation in a world facing "turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also said the two sides will discuss ways to "jointly resist unilateralism and the resurgence of the law of the jungle".
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris expects the talks will focus on a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, as well as the Middle East and trade tensions between China and the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his meeting Wang, Barrot will then head to Shanghai, where he will on Friday inaugurate a hydrogen production plant built by the Air Liquide group and participate in a Franco-Chinese business forum. (AFP)

    Canada PM dubs US auto tariffs 'direct attack'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reacted with anger on Wednesday to US President Donald Trump's imposition of import tariffs on cars, branding it a "direct attack" on his country.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will defend our workers. We'll defend our companies. We'll defend our country. And we'll defend it together," said Carney.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will hurt us, but through this period, by being together, we will emerge stronger."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said earlier Wednesday that he was placing 25 percent tariffs on auto imports and, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney said he needs to see the details of Trump's executive order before taking retaliatory measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called it unjustified and said he would leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday to chair his special Cabinet committee on US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion (US$1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that would protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump’s tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Carney noted it employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said. (Agencies)

    Trump hints at lower tariffs for China over TikTok

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to reduce tariffs to get a deal done with TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the short video app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  ByteDance has an April 5 deadline to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok or face a US ban on national security grounds that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he was willing to extend the deadline if an agreement over the social media app was not reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok did not immediately comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has used tariffs as a bargaining chip in the TikTok negotiations in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 20, his first day in office, he warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a US deal with TikTok. Earlier this month, Trump hiked his additional tariffs on all imports from China to 20 percent up from 10 percent issued in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President JD Vance has said he expects the general terms of an agreement that resolves the ownership of the social media platform to be reached by April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law, passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, required ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app briefly went dark in January after the US Supreme Court upheld the ban, but flickered back to life days later once Trump took office. Trump quickly issued an executive order postponing enforcement of the law to April 5 and said last month that he could further extend that deadline to give himself time to shepherd a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been involved to an unprecedented level in the closely watched deal talks, effectively playing the role of investment bank. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denmark welcomed on Wednesday Washington's decision to limit an American delegation's visit to Greenland to a US military base, after previous plans for the unexpected trip sparked criticism.
 <br>
  <br>
  US Vice President JD Vance announced on Tuesday that he would accompany his wife Usha on Friday to the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the Danish self-governing island coveted by President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to power in January, Trump has insisted he wants to take over Greenland for national security purposes, refusing to rule out the use of force to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance's announcement came just hours after Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland's outgoing Prime Minister Mute Egede harshly criticised plans by a US delegation to visit the Arctic island uninvited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egede had qualified the initial plans as "foreign interference", noting the outgoing government had not "sent out any invitations for visits, private or official".
  <br>
  <br>
  Following March 11 elections, Greenland has only a transitional government, with parties still in negotiations to form a new coalition government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have asked all countries to respect this process," Egede had said in a Facebook post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the White House announced on Sunday that Usha Vance would travel to Greenland from Thursday to Saturday, while Egede had said US national security adviser Mike Waltz was also expected to take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  US media had reported that Energy Secretary Chris Wright would be part of the visit as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Usha Vance had been scheduled to view "historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage and watch the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race," in the southwestern town of Sisimiut, the White House had said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frederiksen denounced that visit as "unacceptable pressure" being put on Greenland and Denmark, and vowed "to resist". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened on Wednesday to seize parts of Gaza if Hamas does not release hostages, while the militant group warned they would return "in coffins" if Israel does not stop bombing the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Just over a week since the military resumed operations following a January truce, Israel said two projectiles were fired from the Gaza Strip, with one intercepted and the other landing near the border, and with no immediate reports of any casualties or damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rocket fire came a day after hundreds of Palestinians staged a rare protest against Hamas, chanting slogans against the Islamist movement and calling for an end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shattering weeks of relative calm in the war brought by the fragile ceasefire, Israel last week resumed intense bombardment and ground operations across Gaza, while militants returned to launching rocket attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, 830 people have been killed in the territory since Israel resumed its strikes on March 18. No deaths have been reported on the Israeli side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli officials say the resumption of operations was meant to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages, after a stalemate in talks with mediators on extending the truce – which saw 33 Israeli captives freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel wanted an extension of the truce's initial phase, while Hamas demanded talks on a second stage that was meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu told parliament that "the more Hamas persists in its refusal to release our hostages, the stronger the pressure we will exert".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This includes the seizure of territories, along with other measures I will not elaborate here," he added, days after his Defence Minister Israel Katz had warned: "The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel".
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which triggered the war, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. (AFP)

    Trump announces 25pc tariff on non-US-built cars

<img alt="US President Donald Trump announces tariffs on auto imports in the Oval Office. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797599_1_20250327060802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on auto imports Wednesday, in a move set to fuel tensions with trading partners ahead of further promised levies next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States. If they're made in the United States, it is absolutely no tariff," he said at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is set to take effect April 2 -- with duties to be collected from April 3 -- and impact foreign-made cars and light trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies will be in addition to those already in place for the goods, and Trump added that "this is permanent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has imposed fresh tariffs on imports from major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China -- as well as a 25 percent duty on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he previously offered automakers temporary reprieve from the levies affecting North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uncertainty over Trump's trade plans and worries they could trigger a downturn have roiled financial markets, with consumer confidence also falling in recent months amid fears of the tariffs' effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street slumped ahead of Trump's announcement, with the tech-focused Nasdaq plunging 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in automaker General Motors closed 3.1 percent down, while Ford eked out a 0.1 percent gain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has referred to levies as a way to raise government revenue, revitalize American industry and press countries on US priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But targeting imported cars could strain ties with countries like Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico and Germany -- which are close US partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Center for Automotive Research has previously estimated that US tariffs -- including those on metals and imported autos -- could increase the price of a car by thousands of dollars and weigh on the jobs market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the automobile industry, Trump is also eyeing sector-specific tariffs on industries like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intent to impose tariffs on lumber and pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's announcement on autos comes ahead of April 2, which Trump has dubbed "Liberation Day" for the world's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has promised reciprocal levies on the date, tailored to different trading partners in an attempt to remedy practices that Washington deemed unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday he said these duties will impact all countries but that they would be "very lenient."
  <br>
  <br>
  It is unclear if further sector-specific tariffs would be announced on April 2, with the White House noting this week that the situation remained fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters Monday that he might "give a lot of countries breaks" eventually, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added Tuesday that he did not want too many exceptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of a narrower tariff rollout had given financial markets a boost, but investors remain jittery over rapid policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump has invoked emergency economic powers for some recent tariffs, his auto levies may build on a previous government investigation completed in 2019, former US trade official Ryan Majerus told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe found that excessive imports were weakening the internal economy and might impair national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time, one recommendation was to institute tariffs of up to 25 percent to bolster US production of autos and parts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advantage with autos," said Majerus, now a partner at the King & Spalding law firm, is that the administration "can act a lot quicker if they want, as opposed to, say in lumber or copper, where they had to launch investigations."
  <br>
  <br>
  US trade partners have been furthering talks with Washington as Trump's reciprocal tariff deadline looms.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic met his American counterparts Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sefcovic said on social media that "the EU's priority is a fair, balanced deal instead of unjustified tariffs." (AFP)

    Magazine publishes US attack plan shared in group chat

<img alt="In the Signal chat, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth lays out the weather conditions, times of attacks and types of aircraft being used. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797576_1_20250326222631.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Atlantic magazine on Wednesday published what it said was the entire text of a chat group mistakenly shared with a journalist by top US national security officials, laying out plans for an imminent attack on Yemen.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stunning details, including the times of strikes and types of planes being used, were all laid out in screenshots of the chat, which the officials had conducted on a commercial Signal messaging app, rather than a secure government platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  The magazine, which initially only published the broad outlines of the chat, said it was now publishing the details after the Trump administration repeatedly denied that any classified information had been included.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scandal has rocked President Donald Trump's administration, which for now is reacting defiantly – attacking The Atlantic and denying any wrongdoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt quickly responded to say The Atlantic was conceding "these were NOT 'war plans.' The entire story was another hoax."
  <br>
  <br>
  National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes had said on Monday the chain cited by The Atlantic appeared to be "authentic."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg said Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sent information in the Signal chat – also including Vice President JD Vance and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe – right ahead of strikes against the Houthi rebels on March 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  For reasons unknown, Goldberg's phone number had been added to the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldberg also revealed disparaging comments by the top US officials about European allies during their chat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic initially did not publish the precise details of the chat, saying it wanted to avoid revealing classified material and information that could endanger American troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Tuesday, Ratcliff and other officials involved in the chat played down the scandal, testifying before Congress that nothing critical had been shared or laws broken – and that nothing discussed was classified.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic said on Wednesday that it had asked the government whether in that case there would be any problem in publishing the rest of the material.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt responded, The Atlantic said, telling the magazine again that "there was no classified information transmitted in the group chat."
  <br>
  <br>
  And a CIA spokesperson asked only that one of the agency's officials referenced in the chain not be identified by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic said its publication on Wednesday included everything in the Signal chain other than that one CIA name.
  <br>
  <br>
  It includes Hegseth laying out the weather conditions, times of attacks and types of aircraft being used.
  <br>
  <br>
  The texting was done barely half an hour before the first US warplanes took off and two hours before the first target, described as "Target Terrorist," was expected to be bombed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The details are shockingly precise for the kind of operation that the public usually only learns about later – and in vaguer terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)," Hegseth writes at one stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier 'Trigger Based' targets)."
  <br>
  <br>
  A short time later, Trump's National Security Advisor Mike Waltz sent real-time intelligence on the aftermath of an attack, writing "Building collapsed. Had multiple positive ID" and "amazing job."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthi rebels, who have controlled much of Yemen for more than a decade, are part of the "axis of resistance" of pro-Iran groups staunchly opposed to Israel and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has stepped up attacks on the group in response to constant Houthi attempts to sink and disrupt shipping through the strategic Red Sea. (AFP)

    UK slashes growth forecast, cuts public spending

<img alt="UK finance minister Rachel Reeves delivers the Spring Statement spending update. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797575_1_20250326221849.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK government halved its 2025 growth forecast on Wednesday as it made billions of pounds of spendings cuts to shore up the public purse in the face of economic headwinds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spring Statement spending update came as the Labour government, elected in July after a landslide election win, faces sluggish economic growth and rising borrowing costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's economy is expected to grow by just one percent this year, revised down from an estimate of two percent made in late October when Labour gave its inaugural budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the UK's spending watchdog, upgraded the country's growth forecast for the three following years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our task is to secure Britain's future in a world that is changing before our eyes," finance minister Rachel Reeves told parliament in the highly-anticipated update.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns over US tariffs and the war in Ukraine have added to the UK's economic woes, chipping away the government's fiscal cushion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The threat facing our continent was transformed when [Russian President Vladimir] Putin invaded Ukraine," Reeves said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that "the job of a responsible government is not simply to watch this change, this moment requires an active government".
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recently pledged to hike spending on defence, with the government confirming Wednesday a £2.2 billion boost next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  To avoid slipping into a deficit, Reeves has cut disability welfare payments and government departmental budgets, blaming a period of heightened uncertainty in global markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Wednesday's update, the centre-left government announced it would slash the cost of running the civil service by 15 percent over the next five years, targeting annual savings of around £2 billion. (AFP)
