 Tesla was removed from the Vancouver International Auto Show in Canada because of safety concerns, the event organisers said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla as a participant in this week's event, after the automaker was provided multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw," Eric Nicholl, executive director for the auto show said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The safety concerns come as protesters across the United States stage demonstrations targeting Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who is spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency's move to shrink the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Vancouver Auto Show's primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors, and staff," Nicholl said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toronto on Monday stopped providing financial incentives for Tesla vehicles purchased as taxis or ride shares due to escalating trade tensions between Canada and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's mayor said that the decision was meant to target Musk, a close adviser to the US president. Trump has called for Canada's annexation and imposed tariffs on Canadian products, angering Canadians. (Reuters)

    Oxygen detected in most distant galaxy: astronomers

<img alt="Dutch and Italian astronomers probed the JADES-GS-z14-0 galaxy using the ALMA radio telescope in Chile's Atacama desert. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796693_1_20250321032017.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oxygen has been detected in the most distant galaxy ever discovered, surprised astronomers said on Thursday, offering further evidence that stars in the early universe matured far quicker than had been thought possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  The galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0, which was discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope last year, is so far away that its light took 13.4 billion years to reach Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  This means the galaxy can also reveal what the universe was like in its infancy, when it was just 300 million years old – two percent of its current age.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since coming online in 2022, the powerful Webb telescope has discovered that galaxies in the young universe were much brighter, more advanced and more numerous than scientists had expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  These discoveries have been so startling they have raised doubts about whether something important is missing in our understanding of the universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the latest research, two international teams led by Dutch and Italian astronomers probed the JADES-GS-z14-0 galaxy using the ALMA radio telescope in Chile's Atacama desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  They detected traces of oxygen, according to the European Southern Observatory, confirming hints previously spotted by the Webb telescope.
  <br>
  <br>
  During this period known as the cosmic dawn, newly born galaxies were thought to only have young stars, which mostly contain light elements like hydrogen and helium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only later were they supposed to get heavier stuff such as oxygen.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the two new studies found that JADES-GS-z14-0 has around 10 times more heavy elements than had been anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is like finding an adolescent where you would only expect babies," said Sander Schouws of Leiden Observatory, the first author of a Dutch-led study to be published in The Astrophysical Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The results show the galaxy has formed very rapidly and is also maturing rapidly, adding to a growing body of evidence that the formation of galaxies happens much faster than was expected," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Astrophysicist Stefano Carniani, lead author of the Italian-led paper to be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, said he was "astonished by the unexpected results."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The evidence that a galaxy is already mature in the infant universe raises questions about when and how galaxies formed." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States fell to its lowest happiness ranking ever partly due to a rise in the number of Americans eating their meals alone, an annual UN-sponsored report said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Finland ranked as the world's happiest country for the eighth straight year in the World Happiness Report, with locals and experts thanking its grand lakes and strong welfare system for boosting its mood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan, plagued by a humanitarian catastrophe since the Taliban regained control in 2020, once again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States fell to 24th place, its lowest score since the report was first published in 2012, when it recorded its highest showing at number 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53 percent over the past two decades," the authors said, noting that sharing meals "is strongly linked with well-being."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, roughly one in four Americans reported eating all their meals alone the previous day, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increasing number of people who eat alone is one reason for declining well-being in the United States," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also noted that the United States was one of few countries to see a rise of so-called "deaths of despair" – from suicide or substance abuse – at a time when those deaths are declining in a majority of countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report surveyed people worldwide in 2022-2024, before US President Donald Trump's shakeup of national and global affairs since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nordic countries all stayed among the 10 happiest, with Denmark, Iceland and Sweden trailing Finland, which slightly extended its lead over runner-up Denmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, at the sixth and 10th spot respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The happiness ranking is based on a three-year average of individuals' self-assessed evaluations of life satisfaction, as well as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity and corruption. (AFP)

    White House promises 'big tariffs' on April 2

<img alt='White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says America "has been ripped off by every country around the world." Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796689_1_20250321011627.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House on Thursday vowed to impose "big tariffs" on April 2 when US President Donald Trump is to unveil reciprocal levies in a major escalation of his trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's comments came days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Washington is expected to present other countries with a number representing their tariff and other barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent's remarks had suggested a possible delay in the activation of some duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leavitt told reporters that Trump has been "very clear about his intention for April 2."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big announcements when it comes to reciprocal trade," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the president will be highlighting the unfair trade practices, the ways in which America has been ripped off by every country around the world, quite frankly."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big tariffs that will be going into effect," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised reciprocal duties on both US allies and competitors from April 2, although the exact details of this plan have yet to be released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent had told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo that on the day, "each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said at the time that some duties may not have to go on as a deal "is pre-negotiated," or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said it fired rockets at Israeli commercial hub Tel Aviv on Thursday in its first military response to the growing civilian death toll from Israel's resumption of air and ground operations in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel said it had closed off the territory's main north-south route as troops expanded the ground operations they resumed on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said 504 people had been killed so far in the Israeli assault this week, including more than 190 children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it fired rockets at Tel Aviv in response to Israel's "massacres" of Gaza civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army said it intercepted one projectile fired from Gaza and that two others struck an uninhabited area.
  <br>
  <br>
  After weeks of stalemate, Israel resumed its air campaign early on Tuesday with a wave of deadly strikes that drew widespread condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The offensive shattered a relative calm that had pervaded the war-ravaged Palestinian territory since a ceasefire took hold on January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump "fully supports" Israel's deadly resumption of air and ground operations in Gaza, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday when asked if he was trying to get a Gaza ceasefire back on track. (AFP)

    Zelensky, EU leaders discuss support for Ukraine

<img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was set to address the summit by video link. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796668_1_20250320205411.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas urged EU leaders on Thursday to pledge 5 billion euros for artillery shells for Ukraine to strengthen its hand in peace talks, amid divergences over how to bolster Kyiv and the EU's own military capabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arriving at an EU summit in Brussels, Kallas called on leaders to match words of support for Kyiv with deeds, as US President Donald Trump pushes ahead with his efforts to end the war, including through a rapprochement with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kallas has scaled back a proposal to pledge up to 40 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine this year, with each country contributing according to its economic size, after resistance from some countries, particularly in southern Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  She told reporters she was now focusing on what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy – who was to address the summit by video link – says he needs most urgently, such as 2 million artillery shells at a cost of 5 billion euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should at least start to have a really concrete step – not only in words, but also in deeds that we are helping Ukraine right now. Because the stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiating table," Kallas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstering the EU's own defences also features on the summit agenda, reflecting deep fears that Moscow may attack an EU member in the coming years and doubts about the future of US protection for Europe via the Nato defence alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuania's President Gitanas Nauseda reiterated his support to Kyiv on Thursday, saying "Ukraine needs our military assistance. Ukraine needs long-range missiles and we are ready to provide it. We should increase the pressure on Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to rearm ourselves because otherwise we will be the next victims of Russian aggression," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But some southern European capitals have been more reticent, reflecting a division between those geographically closer to Russia that have given more aid to Ukraine and those further away that have given less, as a share of their economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he did not like the term "rearm", which the European Commission has used extensively in its push for more defence spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to take into account that the challenges that we face in the southern neighbourhood are a bit different to the ones that the eastern flank faces," he said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Thursday it acted in accordance with the law over the execution of four Canadian citizens in recent weeks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in Ottawa on Wednesday that China had executed four Canadian citizens in recent weeks, defying pleas from Ottawa for leniency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly condemn the executions that did happen against Canadians in China," Joly said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she was unable to discuss details of the case due to privacy requests from the families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing suggested on Thursday the Canadians had been convicted over narcotics offences, saying "... combating drug crimes is the common responsibility of all countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is a country under the rule of law," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing, she said, "treats defendants of different nationalities equally without discrimination" and "handles cases fairly in strict accordance with the law."
  <br>
  <br>
  China "protects the legitimate rights of the parties concerned as well as the consular rights of the Canadian side, in accordance with the law," Mao added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing also defended the executions in a statement sent to Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Drug-related crime is a severe crime recognised worldwide as extremely harmful to the society," the embassy statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a 'zero tolerance' attitude towards the drug problem." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Formula 1 team owner and media personality Eddie Jordan has died, according to his family. He was 76.
 <br>
  <br>
  He ran his own Jordan team in the 1990s and 2000s in F1 and became a popular pundit on TV after selling the team in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan had been undergoing treatment for what he had called “quite aggressive” cancer of the bladder and prostate, which spread to his spine and pelvis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The family said in a statement Jordan “passed away peacefully with family by his side in Cape Town” early on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “EJ brought an abundance of charisma, energy and Irish charm everywhere he went. We all have a huge hole missing without his presence. He will be missed by so many people, but he leaves us with tonnes of great memories to keep us smiling through our sorrow.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish businessman Jordan operated his own racing team in lower-level series before moving up to F1 in 1991, giving future seven-time champion Michael Schumacher his first race that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other drivers over the years included Damon Hill, who won the 1996 championship with Williams, future Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who was third in the championship for Jordan in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Grand Prix won four races before Jordan sold the team in 2005. Following more sales and name changes since then, the team competes as Aston Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 76-year-old Jordan also acted as the manager for car design great Adrian Newey when he left Red Bull for Aston Martin last year. (AP)

    Malaysia gives green light for new MH370 search

<img alt="Relatives of passengers on board the missing MH370 leave after taking part in a demonstration outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing on the 11th anniversary of the flight’s disappearance. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796601_1_20250320142559.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia’s government has given final approval for a Texas-based marine robotics company to renew the search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean more than a decade ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cabinet ministers agreed to terms and conditions for a “no-find, no-fee” contract with Texas-based Ocean Infinity to resume the seabed search operation at a new 15,000-square-kilometre site in the ocean, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said. Ocean Infinity will be paid US$70 million only if it discovers the wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 plane vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, on a flight from Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing. Satellite data showed the plane turned from its flight path and headed south to the far-southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed .
  <br>
  <br>
  An expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues to its location, although debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands. A private search in 2018 by Ocean Infinity also found nothing .
  <br>
  <br>
  The final approval for a new search came three months after Malaysia gave the nod in principle to plans for a fresh search.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity chief executive Oliver Punkett reportedly said this year the company had improved its technology since 2018. He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyse data and had narrowed the search area to the most likely site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said his ministry will ink a contract with Ocean Infinity soon. The firm has reportedly sent a search vessel to the site and indicated that January-April is the best period for the search.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the passengers of flight MH370,” he said. (AP)

    Indonesia passes controversial military law revisions

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia's parliament on Thursday passed contentious revisions to the country's military law, which will allocate more civilian posts for military officers, and street protests against the changes are expected to take place.
 <br>
  <br>
  The revisions have been criticised by civil society groups, who say it could take the world's third-biggest democracy back to the draconian 'New Order' era of former strongman president Suharto, when military officers dominated civilian affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaker Puan Maharani led the unanimous vote in a plenary council and officially passed the law, saying that it was in accordance with the principle of democracy and human rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Prabowo Subianto, who took office in October and was a special forces commander under Suharto, has been expanding the armed forces' role into what were considered civilian areas, including his flagship programme of free meals for children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups have criticised the increased military involvement because they fear it may lead to abuses of power, human rights violations and impunity from consequences for actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said the bill requires officers to resign from the military before assuming civilian posts at departments such as the Attorney's General Office and a a lawmaker has said officers could not join state-owned companies, to counter concerns the military would be involved in business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters from several democracy groups and students have said they will stage rallies in front of the parliamentary building in Jakarta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some students had camped at the back gate of parliamentary building since Wednesday evening, protesting the law and demanding the government pull out all military personnel from civilian jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police officers forced them to leave the building but they refused, one protestor said. There were just a few dozen protesters at the time the bill was passed by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Military personnel were called in for security in the parliamentary building to assist police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The geopolitical changes and global military technology require the military to transform... to face conventional and non conventional conflicts," Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin told parliament, while defending the revised law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will never disappoint the Indonesians in keeping our sovereignty," he added, but did not specify what geopolitical challenges he was referring to. (Reuters)

    Canadian farmers fear 'devastating tariffs impact'

<img alt="China has traditionally been one of Canada's biggest export markets for canola, grown on farms in such places as Alberta. File photo: Artur Widak/AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796564_1_20250320112443.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tariffs on Canadian products including rapeseed oil and pork come into effect on Thursday, with an industry lobby warning the new levies will have a "devastating impact" on farmers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs, announced this month, follow a Beijing probe into levies imposed by Ottawa on Chinese goods last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  They hit rapeseed oil, oil cakes, and peas imported from Canada with a 100 percent surcharge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada is among the world's top producers of canola, a rapeseed crop that is used to make cooking oil, animal feed and biodiesel fuel, and China has historically been one of its largest customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aquatic products and pork, meanwhile, will face a 25 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian industry leaders have warned they would be hit hard by the fresh tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "New tariffs from China on Canadian canola oil and meal will have a devastating impact on canola farmers and the broader value chain at a time of increased trade and geopolitical uncertainty," said Canola Council of Canada president Chris Davison.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the federal government to immediately engage with China, with a view to resolving this issue," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fresh tariffs come as both Canada and China face deepening trade tensions with the US, which under President Donald Trump has rolled out stiff new tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ottawa in August placed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, matching US measures seeking to fend off the import of Chinese cars into North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also announced a surcharge on imports of steel and aluminum products from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's commerce ministry said a probe into these measures found that Canadian policies "disrupted the normal trade order and harmed the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises".
  <br>
  <br>
  In Beijing, some residents said they were supportive of China's tariffs on goods from other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has become strong and doesn't need to rely on others for everything," said Zheng Ruitao, a Beijing resident in his thirties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me personally, it has not much impact, the impact might be on the country," said Song Qing, another Beijing resident. (AFP)

    Trump urges Fed to cut rates as tariffs take effect

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump urged the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday to cut interest rates to help offset effects of his tariffs, renewing his vocal disagreement with the central bank's decision-making.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Do the right thing," Trump demanded in a Wednesday night post on his Truth Social site, hours after the Fed decided to hold rates steady, while reducing its growth forecast and hiking its inflation outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve has pencilled in two rate cuts this year, but chairman Jerome Powell noted that "uncertainty today is unusually elevated" and that inflation is ticking up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many economists have warned that the tariffs – which are being met with trade retaliation by some countries – threaten to possibly tip the US economy and others into recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has admitted that the economy may suffer "a little disturbance" as his planned levies take hold, but that America is otherwise on the cusp of a "golden age".
  <br>
  <br>
  In Wednesday's message, he again stressed that April 2, when he plans to enact "reciprocal tariffs" designed to reset global trade, would be a "liberation day" for the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he wants US interest rates to come down as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy," he posted.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his first term, Trump repeatedly expressed disagreement with the Fed's rate decisions, urging them to be lowered to boost the economy. (AFP)

    Israel resumes ground attacks in Gaza

<img alt="Palestinians flee Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza, after Israel issued evacuation orders for some neighbourhoods. Photo: Abd Elhkeem Khaled/Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796554_1_20250320110026.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel resumed ground operations in Gaza and issued what it called a "last warning" for Palestinians to return hostages and remove Hamas from power.
 <br>
  <br>
  The operation on Wednesday followed Israel's most intense air strikes on Gaza since a truce took hold in January, killing more than 400 people, according to the territory's health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said it had "begun targeted ground operations in the central and southern Gaza Strip to expand the security perimeter and create a partial buffer between the north and south".
  <br>
  <br>
  As Israel defied calls from foreign governments to preserve the ceasefire, Gazans were left to once again comb through rubble to find the bodies of their loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're digging with our bare hands," said a man trying to dislodge a child's body from a heap of concrete in Gaza City.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Israel urged civilians to leave areas it described as "combat zones", families with young children filled the roads leading out of northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred Oola, senior medical officer at the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah, said the renewed strikes shattered the relative calm of the past two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, we can feel the panic in the air... and we can see the pain and devastation in the faces of those we are helping," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the "residents of Gaza," governed by Hamas since 2007, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a video: "This is the last warning."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Take the advice of the president of the United States. Return the hostages and remove Hamas, and other options will open up for you -- including the possibility of leaving for other places in the world for those who want to."
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to a warning earlier this month by US President Donald Trump, who said: "To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, 58 are still held by Gaza militants, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas says it is willing to negotiate and has called on the international community to act to bring the war to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official from the group rejected, however, Israeli demands to renegotiate the three-stage deal agreed with Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has not closed the door on negotiations but we insist there is no need for new agreements," Taher al-Nunu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks have stalled over how to proceed with the ceasefire, after the first phase expired in early March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and the United States have sought to change the terms of the deal by extending phase one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas wants negotiations for phase two, meant to establish a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza while the remaining hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moving to the second phase seems to be a non-option for Israel," said Ghassan Khatib, a political analyst and former Palestinian Authority minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They don't like the second phase because it involves ending the war without necessarily achieving their objective of ending Hamas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and Washington have portrayed Hamas's rejection of a phase one extension as a refusal to release more hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed Israeli bombardment sent a stream of new casualties to the few hospitals still functioning in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN Office for Project Services employee was killed and at least five other people wounded when a UN building in the central city of Deir el-Balah was hit by "explosive ordnance," the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was not an accident," UNOPS chief Jorge Moreira da Silva said, adding that "attacks against humanitarian premises are a breach of international law".
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 280 UN employees have been killed since the start of the war, according to the UN chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Israeli protesters massed in Jerusalem, accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of resuming strikes on Gaza without regard for the safety of the remaining hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war began with Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in 1,218 deaths, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gaza civil defence agency's spokesman Mahmud Bassal said on Wednesday that at least 470 people had been killed in the territory since Israel resumed large-scale air strikes overnight from Monday to Tuesday. (Reuters)

    White House attacks courts for 'usurping' powers

<img alt="Karoline Leavitt in a press briefing at the White House. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796546_1_20250320101240.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House accused judges of "usurping" executive power in its latest broadside against federal courts whose rulings have gone against President Donald Trump's administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Press secretary Karoline Leavitt alleged there had been a "concerted effort by the far left" to pick judges who were "clearly acting as partisan activists" to deal with cases involving the Republican's actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only are they usurping the will of the president and the chief executive of our country, but they are undermining the will of the American public," she said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt in particular lashed out at district judge James Boasberg, who ordered the suspension over the weekend of deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants carried out under an obscure wartime law, calling him a "Democrat activist."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport the alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador as part of its mass deportation program of undocumented migrants. Their names or alleged offences have not been made public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump personally called for the judge's impeachment on Tuesday, saying Boasberg was "a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yale-educated Boasberg, 62, was first appointed to the bench by president George W Bush, a Republican, and later named a district court judge by Obama, a Democrat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's comments drew a rare public rebuke from US Chief Justice John Roberts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision," Roberts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boasberg, in an order in the deportation case on Wednesday, also issued a pointed reminder to Justice Department lawyers that court rulings are to be obeyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the Supreme Court has made crystal clear, the proper recourse for a party subject to an injunction it believes is legally flawed... is appellate review, not disobedience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federal judges are nominated by the president for life and can only be removed by being impeached by the House of Representatives for "high crimes or misdemeanors" and convicted by the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impeachment of federal judges is exceedingly rare and the last time a judge was removed by Congress was in 2010.

  <br>
  Trump, in an interview aired on Fox News Channel's "The Ingraham Angle" on Wednesday, said the chief justice "didn't mention my name in the statement."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But many people have called for [Boasberg's] impeachment," he said. "He actually said we shouldn't be able to take criminals, killers, murderers, horrible, the worst people, gang members, gang leaders... out of our country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, that's a presidential job," Trump said. "That's not for a local judge to be making that determination."
  <br>
  <br>
  Judges have dealt Trump a number of setbacks in recent weeks as his administration pursues its wholesale overhaul of the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship has been blocked by the courts and a judge on Tuesday ordered an immediate halt to the shutdown of the main US aid agency by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same day, another judge suspended the Pentagon's ban on transgender people serving in the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South African-born billionaire Musk railed against what he called a "judicial coup" in posts on his social network X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need 60 senators to impeach the judges and restore rule of the people," Musk said, misstating the process and the actual number of senators required, which is 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller also lashed out at the judiciary, accusing it of waging an "assault on democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "District court judges have assumed the mantle of Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, Secretary of Homeland Security and Commander-in-Chief," Miller said on X. (AFP)
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, the first convicted felon to serve in the White House, has a history of attacking the judges who presided over his civil and criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump's administration now appears bent on a showdown with the judiciary as he asserts extraordinary levels of executive power. (AFP)

    Trump to sign order to dismantle Education Department

<img alt="A protester stands near the US Department of Education headquarters after the agency said it would lay off nearly half its staff. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796539_1_20250320092913.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump is expected to sign an order on Thursday aiming to dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling a long-held goal of American conservatives.
 <br>
  <br>
  The order, which several media outlets on Wednesday reported would be signed during a White House ceremony, comes as efforts are already underway in the department to drastically downsize its staffing and slash funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's education secretary, former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, issued a memo shortly after her swearing in on March 3 saying the agency would be beginning its "final mission."
  <br>
  <br>
  The next week, she moved to halve the department's staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, promised to decentralise education during his election campaign, saying he would devolve the department's powers to state governments, as desired for decades by many Republicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traditionally, the federal government has had a limited role in education in the United States, with only about 13 percent of funding for primary and secondary schools coming from federal coffers, the rest being funded by states and local communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But federal funding is invaluable for low-income schools and students with special needs. And the federal government has been essential in enforcing key civil rights protections for students.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, the Education Department, created in 1979, cannot be shuttered without the approval of Congress and Republicans do not have the votes to push that through.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, as with other federal agencies under Trump's second administration, the department is likely to see further cuts to programmes and employees, which could significantly cripple its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moves are being spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), whose rapid actions have met pushback in courts for possibly exceeding executive authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar move to dismantle the US Agency for International Development was halted on Monday by a federal judge, who said the push likely violated the Constitution. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chile said on Wednesday it was reviewing an agreement for the construction of a Chinese astronomical observatory on its soil, a project that has drawn criticism from Washington as it jostles with Beijing for influence in Latin America.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under an agreement signed by President Xi Jinping in 2016 with Chile's Catholic University of the North (UCN), the Ventarrones Astronomical Park was to be built in Chile's Atacama desert - home to the world's darkest skies and numerous other observatories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The project is under review, it is not cancelled," the foreign ministry in Santiago said in a statement, without providing reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said its legal department was studying the agreement and had contacted the UCN and the Chinese embassy for more information.
  <br>
  <br>
  UCN said it had made the requested data available. The embassy said the observatory was "an open and transparent international initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of Latin American countries have joined Xi's trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure program, and China has surpassed the United States as the biggest trading partner of Brazil, Peru, Chile and several other countries. (AFP)

    Japan marks 30 years since subway sarin attack

<img alt="A commuter is treated after being exposed to sarin gas fumes on the Tokyo Metro system on March 20, 1995. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796530_1_20250320083940.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan on Thursday marked the 30th anniversary of the sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway that killed more than a dozen people and injured more than 5,800.
 <br>
  <br>
  A small group of Tokyo subway workers were to hold a solemn annual ceremony at Kasumigaseki station at the heart of the capital's government district, one of several areas targeted in the 1995 carnage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims and experts warn that the cult behind the coordinated attack remains active and is recruiting young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  On March 20, 1995, five members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult dropped bags of Nazi-developed sarin nerve agent inside morning commuter trains, piercing the pouches with sharpened umbrella tips before fleeing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trains drove on, trapping passengers inside with the deadly fumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the trains stopped, passengers streamed out of stations vomiting and struggling to breathe, with emergency workers providing care by the side of the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack killed 13 people, while a 14th victim died in 2020 after suffering severe brain damage in the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 5,800 others were injured, many of whom are still suffering from vision problems, fatigue and psychological trauma.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cult's wild-haired, nearly blind leader Shoko Asahara was executed in 2018 along with 12 disciples for the attack and other violent crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asahara, whose real name was Chizuo Matsumoto, preached that the apocalypse was coming and that murders could elevate souls to a higher realm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aum has been disbanded, but its dead leader is still worshipped in Japan by an estimated 1,600 members of successor groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts warn that the groups are reaching young recruits in secret both in person and through social media and messaging apps, where they are also spreading posts saying that Aum's crimes were misportrayed. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's foreign minister David Lammy on Wednesday called for a transparent investigation into an Israeli air strike on a UN building in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Appalled a UN compound in Gaza was hit this morning," Lammy wrote on X. "This incident must be investigated transparently and those responsible held to account.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel announced renewed ground operations in Gaza on Wednesday and issued what it called a "last warning" to residents of the Palestinian territory to return hostages and remove Hamas from power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces this week conducted the deadliest wave of air strikes since the start of a truce in January, killing hundreds of people, according to the health ministry in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military said it had "begun targeted ground operations in the central and southern Gaza Strip to expand the security perimeter and create a partial buffer between the north and south".
  <br>
  <br>
  As Israel kept up its renewed bombardment despite a chorus of calls from foreign governments to preserve the ceasefire, long lines of fleeing civilians filled the roads of Gaza on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Families with young children fled northern Gaza for areas further south, fearing for their lives after Israel urged civilians to leave areas it described as "combat zones".
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred Oola, senior medical officer at the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah, said the renewed strikes had shattered the relative calm of the past two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, we can feel the panic in the air... and we can see the pain and devastation in the faces of those we are helping," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the "residents of Gaza", Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a video statement: "This is the last warning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, The Gaza civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on Wednesday killed 14 members of the same family in the northern town of Beit Lahia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that "at least 14 martyrs and several wounded from one family" were transferred to a hospital "after the (Israeli) occupation carried out an air strike targeting a house where a mourning tent was held", adding several people were feared buried under the rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  The casualties and victims had gathered at the home of a family who were mourning the recent loss of their loved ones when the strike occurred. They were then transferred to the Indonesian Hospital, according to the Palestinian News Agency. (AFP)

    Trump suggests US takeover of Ukraine's power plants

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump hailed a "very good" call with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday, a day after Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on Kyiv's power plants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said efforts to secure a full ceasefire in Russia's three-year-old war remained "on track," despite the fact that his call with Putin failed to produce any broader peace deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of continuing attacks, Zelensky said after the "frank" call that Ukraine was ready to pause strikes on both Russian energy and civilian infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he spoke for around an hour with his Ukrainian counterpart, their first conversation since they had a blazing televised row in the Oval Office just over two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs," Trump said on his Truth Social network.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very much on track."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House later said that during the call Trump had floated US "ownership" of Ukrainian power plants as it would be the "best protection" for them.

  </a>
  , RTHK's Washington correspondent Simon Marks said while Trump was showing American willingness to help Ukraine repair its damaged power infrastructure, it also showcased how transactional his administration is on foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was another one of those jarring moments at the White House when that was suddenly announced. There had been no indication at all leading up to either of these calls with Vladimir Putin or Volodymyr Zelensky that that was what Donald Trump had in mind... it also indicates that for Donald Trump, so many of these international issues he seems to think can be resolved like a business negotiation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire former real estate mogul has already pushed Kyiv into a deal to give the United States preferential access to its critical mineral resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also pledged to help Ukraine get more air defence equipment from Europe, a statement from National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while Ukraine has already agreed to a US plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Russia, Putin is still refusing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin leader insisted during his call with Trump that a full ceasefire was only possible if the West halts its billions of dollars in military aid to Kyiv – Moscow's long-standing demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin also demanded Ukraine must not be allowed to rearm, and that it must halt mandatory mobilisation. (AFP)

    Malaysia agrees terms for resumption of MH370 search

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia has agreed to the terms and conditions of an agreement with exploration firm Ocean Infinity to resume the search for the wreckage of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, its transport minister said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flight MH370, a Boeing 777, was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in 2014 in one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision will enable commencement of seabed search operations in a new location estimated to cover 15,000 sq km (5,790 sq miles) in the southern Indian Ocean, based on a "no find, no fee" principle, minister Loke Siew Fook said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity will receive US$70 million if the wreckage is successfully located, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the MH370 passengers," Loke said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Malaysian government in December said it had agreed in principle with Ocean Infinity's proposal to resume the hunt for MH370. The firm had conducted the last search for the plane that ended in 2018 but failed on two attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those followed an underwater search by Malaysia, Australia and China in a 120,000 sq km (46,332 sq mile) area of the southern Indian Ocean, based on the data of automatic connections between an Inmarsat satellite and the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  A ship that will look for the missing plane was deployed to its Indian Ocean search zone late last month, ship tracking data showed, even though a deal had yet to be signed with the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear how long the search contract with Ocean Infinity would be. Loke had previously said it would cover an 18-month period. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's resumption of strikes on the Gaza Strip is a major step in the wrong direction after its ceasefire with Palestinian militant group Hamas earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday alongside Jordan's King Abdullah II.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of Israeli strikes…despite the efforts of mediators, represents a dramatic step backwards," Macron said ahead of talks in Paris with Abdullah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's dramatic for the Palestinians of Gaza, who are again plunged into the terror of bombardment, and dramatic for the [Israeli] hostages and their families who live in the nightmare of uncertainty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel earlier this week carried out its deadliest bombing of Gaza since a fragile ceasefire began in January between Israel and the Palestinian territory's Islamist rulers Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed Israeli air strikes in the night of Monday to Tuesday killed more than 400 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. They have continued since.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron slammed Hamas, saying the "axis of resistance is today an illusion", but also warned Israel that there could be "no Israeli military solution in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jordanian king called the strikes "an extremely dangerous step that adds further devastation to an already dire humanitarian situation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire must be restored and the flow of aid must resume immediately," Abdullah said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the war stops, France has thrown its support behind a plan put forward by Arab nations, including Jordan, to rebuild Gaza without evicting its 2.4 million Palestinian residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We French and Europeans are ready to contribute to these deliberations and to this plan," Macron said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron said he and other European leaders would discuss it on Thursday at the European Council, "among ourselves and with the Secretary General of the United Nations".
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Britain, Germany and Italy earlier this month backed the plan, hailing it as a "realistic path" for Gaza to return to the control of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority after nearly two decades of Hamas rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and the United States have rejected the proposal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A UK teenager who killed three family members and planned to outdo notorious US massacres to become "the world's most famous school shooter of the 21st century" was on Wednesday jailed for a minimum of 49 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nicholas Prosper, 18 at the time of the killings, used a shotgun to kill his mother Juliana Falcon, 48, sister Giselle, 13, and brother Kyle, 16, who also received more than 100 knife wounds, at their home in Luton, southern England, in September 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Your ambition was notoriety. You wanted to be known posthumously as the world's most famous school shooter of the 21st century," Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said on Wednesday as she sentenced the now 19-year-old Prosper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosper told police upon his arrest of his "Friday the 13th" plan to kill four-year-old pupils and two teachers at a nearby primary school, and then himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said his aim was to conduct an attack more deadly than the US Sandy Hook and Virginia Tech massacres, but the plan was interrupted when his mother woke up before he could kill his family in their sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  The noisy struggle alerted neighbours, who called the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You explicitly sought to emulate and outdo Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old American who shot dead 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Connecticut in 2012," the judge said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You aimed for 34 deaths, one more than the deadliest school shooting of recent times in the United States of America, at Virginia Tech in 2007," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosper, who experts said showed symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), was handed a life sentence, with a minimum term of 49 years. Taking into account the time already served, he will serve a minimum of 48 years and 177 days. (AFP)

<img alt="Supporters and municipality workers hold a rally in Istanbul in support of mayor Ekrem Imamoglu following his arrest. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796448_1_20250319175032.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey's lira fell 12.7 percent and touched a new all-time low of 42 to the dollar on Wednesday, with bonds and stocks also tumbling sharply, after authorities detained President Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, who was expected to be named as the main opposition's presidential candidate within days, faces charges including corruption and aiding a terrorist group. The currency traded at 39.3 to the dollar at one stage, from a close of 36.67 on Tuesday, having recovered somewhat from the record low it hit earlier on Wednesday in what looked set to be its largest absolute daily move on record. Turkey's international government bonds also came under pressure with longer-dated maturities suffering the sharpest falls. The 2045 maturity slipped 1.5 cents to be bid at 85.13 cents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Turkey this morning, bonds and FX are coming under pressure after a potential presidential candidate, the mayor of Istanbul, was arrested," said Frantisek Taborsky, EMEA FX & fixed income strategist at ING.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Turkey's lira] is the most heavily positioned carry-trade in the emerging markets space at the moment in our view, and a sharp move could potentially lead to further outflows. On the other hand, we should see local banks providing some FX support."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks also crashed, reflecting investor worries over rule of law. Borsa Istanbul said trading was halted temporarily after the main BIST 100 index fell 6.87 percent in early trading and the market-wide circuit breaker was triggered.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BIST 100 index was down 4.97  percent at one stage while the banking sub-index declined 7.57 percent after trading resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A wave of selling was triggered after Imamoglu's diploma was annulled and he was detained. There have been foreign investor inflows in recent days...but political uncertainty currently prevails and concerns about foreign investors leaving the country have increased," Serhat Baskurt, algorithmic operations manager at ALB Yatırım, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baskurt said he expected the decline on the stock exchange to continue over the coming days. (Reuters)

<img alt="US officials say talks aimed at a ceasefire in Ukraine would be held in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah on Sunday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796380_1_20250319110641.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Talks on a ceasefire in Russia's conflict with Ukraine will continue on Sunday in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Fox News hours after Trump held a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Witkoff said talks on a ceasefire deal "will begin on Sunday in Jeddah."
  <br>
  <br>
  Witkoff said the US delegation in Saudi Arabia would be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, but did not indicate who they would be holding talks with.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referring to a ceasefire on energy infrastructure and targets in the Black Sea, Witkoff said: "I think both of those are now agreed to by the Russians. I am certainly hopeful that the Ukrainians will agree to it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine on Wednesday accused Russia of effectively rejecting the US-backed ceasefire proposal, reporting a barrage of strikes on civilian infrastructure hours after Moscow agreed only to pause attacks on the energy grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington has been pushing for a full, 30-day ceasefire as a first step towards a wider peace settlement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a 90-minute call with Trump on Tuesday, Russian President Putin refused, insisting that any such deal would be contingent on Ukraine's allies halting all military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Kremlin, Putin has already ordered his military to pause strikes against Ukrainian energy targets for 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witkoff, however, reiterated the proposed ceasefire included "energy and infrastructure in general."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's envoy commended Russian President Putin "for all he did today on that call to move his country close to a final peace deal." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Wednesday accused Russia of effectively rejecting a US-backed ceasefire proposal, reporting a barrage of strikes on civilian infrastructure hours after Moscow agreed only to pause attacks on the energy grid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington has been pushing for a full, 30-day ceasefire as a first step towards a wider settlement of the grinding three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in a 90-minute call with Donald Trump on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin refused, insisting that any such deal would be contingent on the West halting all military aid for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Kremlin, Putin has already ordered his military to pause strikes against Ukrainian energy targets for 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The highly anticipated Putin-Trump call also resulted in the announcement that Russia and Ukraine will exchange 175 prisoners each on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky welcomed the proposed energy truce but said he needed more "details" from Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has launched devastating attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the war, while Ukraine has used drones to bomb multiple Russian oil installations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions rang out and air raid sirens wailed in Ukraine just hours after Trump and Putin spoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said "there have been hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure", including a hospital in Sumy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is these types of nighttime attacks by Russia that destroy our energy sector, our infrastructure, and the normal life of Ukrainians," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Kyiv, Ukrainians were doubtful of any concessions from Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lev Sholoudko, 32 said he did not expect even the energy infrastructure would be spared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't believe Putin at all, not a single word. He only understands force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who says he has an "understanding" with Putin, has been seeking a breakthrough in the Ukraine war since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stunned the world when he announced he had started direct talks with Russia to end the conflict, sparking fears among allies that he was pivoting too far towards Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president hailed his latest call with Putin as "good and productive," and the White House said in a readout that the Russian leader had consented to a 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Moscow also underlined that a fuller truce was dependent on long-standing demands for a "complete cessation" of Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Kremlin statement also emphasised that Kyiv could not rearm or mobilise during any ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky, who accepted a full ceasefire proposal during talks in Saudi Arabia last week, has lashed out at Russia for its reluctance to reach a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are not ready to end this war, and we can see that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky also said that Ukrainian troops would continue fighting in Russia's Kursk region "as long as we need," following days of major Russian advances in the area that Kyiv partially seized last year. (AFP)

    Trump to unveil reciprocal tariffs on April 2

<img alt="US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said if countries stop their practices, the US would not put up the tariff wall. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796362_1_20250319092836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington is expected to present US trading partners on April 2 with a number representing their tariff and other barriers, as it unveils reciprocal levies tailored to each country, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump has promised reciprocal duties - on both US allies and competitors alike - from April 2, though his administration has yet to release the exact details of the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What's going to happen on April 2 - each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs," Bessent told Fox Business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added on "Mornings With Maria."
  <br>
  <br>
  With just over two weeks until April 2, he did not say whether those calculations would be complete for all nations by the deadline, but left open the door to some avoiding reciprocal tariffs on that date.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some duties "may not have to go on because a deal is pre-negotiated," he said, or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks once they receive their number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Monday on social media that April 2 would be "Liberation Day for America," promising to "start taking back some of the vast wealth that has been taken from us."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's tariff plans and the uncertainty surrounding them have shaken markets in recent weeks, fanning fears that an economic ebb could be in the cards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Bessent told Fox Business that he saw "no reason we need to have a recession," saying "the underlying economy is healthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former hedge fund manager raised the idea of a "pause" as the economy transitions away from "unsustainable" levels of government spending, pledging that the Trump administration would rein in expenditures and bring manufacturing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Bessent stressed that Trump has identified "critical industries" - like steel and aluminium among manufacturing sectors - for which he hopes to bring production back to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "we're going to take in substantial revenues," pointing to these as a means to offset the government deficit. (AFP)

File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796360_1_20250319091826.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee climate disasters last year, the United Nations said on Wednesday, highlighting the urgent need for early warning systems covering the entire planet.
 <br>
  <br>
  Poorer countries are severely affected by cyclones, droughts, wildfires and other disasters, according to the State of the Global Climate annual report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN's weather and climate agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WMO said the record number of people fleeing climate disasters was based on figures from the International Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which has been collecting data on the subject since 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Mozambique, around 100,000 people were displaced by Cyclone Chido.
  <br>
  <br>
  But wealthy countries were also hit, with the WMO pointing to the floods in the Spanish city of Valencia, which killed 224 people, and the devastating fires in Canada and the United States which forced more than 300,000 people to flee their homes in search of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response, WMO and the global community are intensifying efforts to strengthen early warning systems and climate services," said the agency's chief Celeste Saulo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WMO wants everyone in the world covered by such systems by the end of 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides underlining the massive economic and social upheavals from extreme weather, the State of the Global Climate report said climate change indicators had once again reached record levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The clear signs of human-induced climate change reached new heights in 2024, with some of the consequences being irreversible over hundreds if not thousands of years," the WMO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2015 Paris climate accords aimed to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - and to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, and the first calendar year over the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold, with the global mean near-surface temperature 1.55 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average, according to an analysis compiling the six major international datasets.

 US Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday issued a rare public rebuke of President Donald Trump, over his call for the impeachment of a federal judge, in an extraordinary display of conflict between the executive and judiciary branches.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rebuke from the Supreme Court's leader demonstrated how controversy over recent flights of Venezuelan immigrants has inflamed tensions over the judiciary's role, with a legal case challenging Trump's actions now threatening to spiral into a clash of constitutional powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision," Roberts said in a brief statement. "The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  The rare statement came just hours after a social media post from Trump, who described US District Judge James E Boasberg as an unelected “troublemaker and agitator.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Boasberg had issued an order blocking deportation flights that Trump was carrying out by invoking wartime authorities from an 18th century law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been sharply critical of district courts which have blocked some of the president's executive actions but this was the first time Trump has personally called for a judge's impeachment since he took office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federal judges are nominated by the president for life and can only be removed by being impeached by the House of Representatives for "high crimes or misdemeanors" and convicted by the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impeachment of federal judges is exceedingly rare and the last time a judge was removed by Congress was in 2010. (Agencies)

 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Tuesday that massive overnight strikes on Gaza were "only the beginning" and that future negotiations with Hamas "will take place only under fire".
 <br>
  <br>
  The strikes, by far the largest since a truce took effect in January, killed more than 400 people across Gaza, according to its health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said in a video statement on Tuesday evening that "Hamas has already felt the strength of our arm in the past 24 hours. And I want to promise you - and them - this is only the beginning".
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations have stalled over how to proceed with a ceasefire whose first phase has expired, with Israel and Hamas disagreeing on whether to move to a new phase intended to bring the war to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli premier said in his address that "from now on, negotiations will take place only under fire," before adding: "Military pressure is essential for the release of additional hostages".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the return of all the hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the October 2023 attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has not responded militarily so far, and in a statement urged friendly countries to "pressure" the United States to bring to an end the strikes by its ally Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Israel consulted US President Donald Trump's administration before launching the strikes, while Israel said the return to fighting was "fully coordinated" with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  A State Department spokesperson said that "Hamas bears total responsibility... for the resumption of hostilities".
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations and countries around the world condemned the strikes, while the families of Israeli hostages pleaded with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt the violence, fearing for the fate of their loved ones. (AFP)

    US releases final trove of Kennedy assassination files

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US National Archives on Tuesday released the final batch of files related to the assassination of president John F Kennedy - a case that still fuels conspiracy theories more than 60 years after his death.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move follows an executive order issued by US President Donald Trump in January directing the unredacted release of the remaining files related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother, former attorney general Robert F Kennedy, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In accordance with President Donald Trump's directive... all records previously withheld for classification that are part of the President John F Kennedy Assassination Records Collection are released," the Archives said in a statement on its website on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Archives has released millions of pages of records over the past decades relating to the assassination of then-president Kennedy in November 1963, but thousands of documents had been held back at the request of the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation, citing national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warren Commission that investigated the shooting of the charismatic 46-year-old president determined that it was carried out by a former Marine sharpshooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that formal conclusion has done little to quell speculation that a more sinister plot was behind Kennedy's murder in Dallas, Texas, and the slow release of the government files has added fuel to various conspiracy theories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy scholars have said the documents that were still held by the archives were unlikely to contain any bombshell revelations or put to rest the rampant conspiracy theories about the assassination of the 35th US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oswald was shot by a strip club owner, Jack Ruby, on November 24, 1963 - two days after the Kennedy assassination - while being moved to a county jail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the records already released were raw intelligence, including scores of reports from FBI agents following up leads that led nowhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of what they contain was also previously known, such as that the communist-obsessed CIA cooked up several outlandish plots to murder Cuba's Fidel Castro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 but returned to the United States in 1962.
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of the documents follows an October 26, 1992 act of Congress which required that the unredacted assassination records held in the National Archives be released in full 25 years later. (AFP)

    Nasa astronauts Wilmore and Williams splash down

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned to Earth in a SpaceX capsule on Tuesday with a soft splashdown off Florida's coast, nine months after their faulty Boeing Starliner craft upended what was to be a week-long stay on the International Space Station.
 <br>
  <br>
  Their return caps a protracted space mission that was fraught with uncertainty and technical troubles and turned a rare instance of Nasa's contingency planning - and the latest failures of Boeing's Starliner - into a global spectacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams, two veteran Nasa astronauts and retired US Navy test pilots, had strapped inside their Crew Dragon spacecraft along with two other astronauts and undocked from the orbiting laboratory of the ISS at 1.05 a.m. ET (0505 GMT) to embark on a 17-hour trip to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-person crew, formally part of Nasa's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, re-entered Earth's atmosphere around 5:45 p.m. ET. Using Earth's atmosphere and two sets of parachutes, the craft slowed its orbital speed of roughly 17,000 miles per hour to a soft 17 miles per hour at splashdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dressed in re-entry suits, boots and helmets, the astronauts were seen earlier on Nasa's live footage laughing, hugging and posing for photos with their colleagues from the station shortly before they were shut into the capsule for two hours of final pressure, communications and seal tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The astronaut pair had launched into space as Starliner's first crew in June for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission. But issues with Starliner's propulsion system led to cascading delays to their return home, culminating in a Nasa decision last year to have them take a SpaceX craft back this year as part of the agency's crew rotation schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission has captured the attention of US President Donald Trump, who upon taking office in January called for a quicker return of Wilmore and Williams and alleged without evidence that former President Joe Biden "abandoned" them on the ISS for political reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, echoed his call for an earlier return. SpaceX's Crew Dragon is the United States' only orbital-class crew spacecraft, which Boeing had hoped its Starliner would compete with before the mission with Wilmore and Williams threw its development future into uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the splashdown, the astronauts will be flown to their crew quarters at the space agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston for several days of health checks, per routine for astronaut returns, before Nasa flight surgeons approve they can go home to their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Living in space for months can affect the human body in multiple ways, from muscle atrophy to possible vision impairment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams have logged 286 days in space on the mission - longer than the average six-month ISS mission length, but far short of US record holder Frank Rubio. His continuous 371 days in space, ending in 2023, were the unexpected result of a coolant leak on a Russian spacecraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams, capping her third spaceflight, has tallied 608 cumulative days in space, the second most for any US astronaut after Peggy Whitson's 675 days. Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko set the world record last year at 878 cumulative days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swept up in Nasa's routine astronaut rotation schedule, Wilmore and Williams could not begin their return to Earth until their replacement crew arrived, in order to maintain adequate US staffing levels, according to Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their replacements arrived on Friday night - four astronauts as part of Nasa's Crew-10 mission that briefly put the station's headcount at 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short," Wilmore told reporters from space earlier this month, adding that he did not believe Nasa's decision to keep them on the ISS until Crew-10's arrival had been affected by politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's what your nation's human spaceflight programme's all about," he said. "Planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams had been doing scientific research and conducting routine maintenance with the station's other five astronauts. Williams had performed two six-hour spacewalks for maintenance outside the ISS, including one with Wilmore.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ISS, about 254 miles (409 km) in altitude, is a football field-sized research lab that has been housed continuously by international crews of astronauts for nearly 25 years, a key platform of science diplomacy managed primarily by the US and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams told reporters earlier this month that she was looking forward to returning home to see her two dogs and family. "It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us," she said. (Reuters)

    Germany votes for big defence spending package

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German lawmakers gave the green light on Tuesday for a colossal spending boost for defence and infrastructure pushed by chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz amid deep fears in Europe over the future strength of the transatlantic alliance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unprecedented fiscal package – dubbed an "XXL-sized" cash "bazooka" by German media – could pave the way for more than one trillion euros in spending over the next decade in Europe's top economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The historic parliament vote signalled a radical departure for a country famously reluctant to take on large state debt – or to spend heavily on the armed forces, given its dark World War II history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz, who is expected to become Germany's next chancellor after his CDU/CSU alliance won last month's elections, argued that dramatic steps are needed at a time of geopolitical turmoil sparked by Russia's war with Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  European countries have been further unsettled by US President Donald Trump's outreach to Russia and signals of an uncertain commitment to Nato and Europe's defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to parliament, Merz cited Russia's "war of aggression against Europe" and said the funding boost would spell "the first major step towards a new European defence community".
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz's centre-right alliance and their likely future coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have hammered out the package over recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan would exempt defence spending above one percent of GDP from Germany's strict debt rules and set up a 500-billion-euro (US$545-billion) fund for infrastructure investments over 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the short term, Berlin looked set to soon approve an additional three billion euros in military aid for Ukraine. (AFP)

<img alt="The two spoke for more than an hour and a half, and both expressed hopes for repairing relations between the countries. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796323_1_20250319031834.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Tuesday on a halt in Russian attacks against Ukrainian energy targets – but fell far short of securing a full ceasefire in a highly anticipated phone call.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two spoke for more than an hour and a half, and both expressed hopes for repairing relations between the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was no agreement from the Russian president for Washington's proposed full 30-day ceasefire in Russia's war with its pro-Western neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said Putin agreed to pause strikes on Ukraine energy targets for 30 days and that Putin had already given the order to his military. The White House said separately that the "leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire".
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has launched a series of devastating attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the three-year-old war. According to the Kremlin statement, Ukraine – which has bombed multiple Russian oil installations – had also agreed to the truce on energy targets, although Kyiv had yet to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders agreed that broader truce talks would "begin immediately in the Middle East," the White House said in its statement, also citing a "huge upside" if Russia and the United States improve their relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Kremlin statement said a "key condition" for peace would be ending Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military – a position that will alarm Kyiv and European capitals that have already accused Putin of stalling. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Despair mixed with anger in Kocani, North Macedonia on Tuesday in the wake of a horrific nightclub fire that left dozens dead and even more injured, prompting demands for justice.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the town of just 30,000 people, the deaths of 59 people – most of them teenagers and young adults – touched almost every home, with the agony of losing so many young people cutting especially deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are a small place. We all know each other," Sasko Jordanov, a 38-year-old dentist in Kocani, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am a doctor and have many patients dead, children of friends and neighbours."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have children – their friends died. This is horrible," said a woman as she lit candles at a makeshift shrine, where others left flowers and messages of condolence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire rapidly spread as a crowd of young fans packed into Club Pulse to attend the performance by a popular hip-hop band, DNK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze was apparently started by fireworks onstage igniting the ceiling of the nightclub.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 500 people were crammed inside despite just 250 tickets being sold, according to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of those killed were trampled as they rushed to the exits, while the roof was consumed with flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutor's office said the club had breached numerous fire regulations, including having insufficient extinguishers and emergency exits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Pance Toskovski said investigators had determined the club owner operated under a forged licence, and vowed to crackdown on corruption. (AFP)

 The United States on Tuesday said that Hamas had chosen war by refusing to release hostages, as Israel unleashed its most intense strikes since a ceasefire, killing more than 400 people, and vowed to continue fighting until all hostages are returned.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement that "Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hughes' statement comes as Hamas leader Sami Abu Zuhri said that the Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip were an attempt to force the group's "surrender", and called the United States "complicit" in the escalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aim of the massacres committed by the occupation in Gaza is to undermine the ceasefire agreement and attempt to impose a surrender agreement, writing it in the blood of Gaza," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel's foreign minister Gideon Saar said that his country had "no alternative" other than to resume military operations in Gaza after efforts to secure the release of hostages failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saar's comments come as relatives of the Israeli hostages accused the country's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of sacrificing their loved ones by carrying out the strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  They called on supporters of the hostages to demonstrate outside Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem, warning that "military pressure could further endanger their lives and complicate efforts to bring them back safe and sound".
  <br>
  <br>
  Liran Berman is a brother of twin siblings who are being held hostage in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now my brothers are alive. My worst nightmare is to become a family of deceased and killed hostages. This is my worst nightmare right now," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the British government has called on Israel and Hamas to implement their ceasefire agreement for Gaza in full, and the EU has called for an immediate end to the renewed violence in the strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Moscow has said it deeply regrets Israel's resumption of military operation in Gaza. (Agencies)

 At least seven people were killed on Monday when a small plane crashed into the sea while taking off from the Honduras Caribbean island of Roatan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major Wilmer Guerrero of the country's fire department told reporters 10 people were retrieved from the site of the crash, six of whom were pronounced dead at the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  A crew member's body was then found floating in the sea near the plane, which crashed about a kilometre from the coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials gave conflicting reports on the number of people on board the plane -- either 17 or 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guerrero said one of the passengers, a 40-year-old French citizen, would be transferred to a hospital in the city of San Pedro Sula on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lanhsa airlines plane took off at nightfall from Roatan, one of the Bay Islands, and one of Honduras' main tourist destinations, heading for the port of La Ceiba, on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The plane almost fell on us. I was fishing," a fisherman told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honduran President Xiomara Castro said she had "immediately activated" an emergency committee made up of the armed forces, firefighters, and others to assist the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash was caused by an "apparent mechanical failure" on the British-made Jetstream 41, police said in a statement. (AFP)

    Scores dead in new Israeli strikes against Hamas

 Israel launched new strikes against Hamas on Tuesday and promised "increasing military force" after talks on further hostage releases stalled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Ministry in Gaza said at least 200 people were killed and another 150 were wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he instructed the military to take "strong action" against Hamas in Gaza in response to the group's refusal to release hostages and rejection of all ceasefire proposals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength," the prime minister's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes come after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the 17-month long war where dozens of hostages were released for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior Hamas official accused Israel of unilaterally overturning the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Hamas said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin "Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Three houses were hit in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, a building in Gaza City, and targets in Khan Younis and Rafah, according to medics and witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab mediators, backed by the United States, haven't been able to hammer out differences between the two warring parties in talks held over the past two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Beijing on Tuesday called for steps to prevent a "humanitarian disaster" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is highly concerned about the current situation between Israel and Palestine," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said, calling for the parties to "avoid any actions that could lead to an escalation of the situation, and prevent a larger-scale humanitarian disaster". (Agencies)

    MMA star Conor McGregor meets Trump at White House

<img alt="Irish UFC fighter Conor McGregor stands at the briefing room lectern with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796184_1_20250318092653.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Irish mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor, who has been found liable of sexual assault, met Donald Trump during a Saint Patrick's Day visit on Monday during which he lashed out at illegal immigration in Ireland.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Ireland is at the cusp of potentially losing its Irishness," said McGregor during an appearance in the White House briefing room alongside the US president's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The illegal immigration racket is running ravage on the country," added the fighter, wearing a green business suit to mark Saint Patrick's Day, the centuries-old celebration of his homeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later hosted the 36-year-old former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) star - whom he said last week was his favourite Irishman - in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor posed for a picture with his arm around Trump's shoulder as the president sat at his desk, and for another with tech tycoon and powerful Trump advisor Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla billionaire Musk previously backed McGregor when he spoke in the past about a possible presidential bid in Ireland. Musk has recently spoken out in support of a number of anti-immigration parties in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Your work ethic is inspiring," McGregor told Trump, according to footage posted by an aide to the US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yours is too, you're fantastic," replied Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor had earlier said he would be "listening" to Trump on immigration - one of the US president's main focus areas as he seeks to ramp up deportations of people without proper documentation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We couldn't think of a better guest to have with us on Saint Patrick's Day," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor's comments earned swift pushback from Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, who met with Trump last week in the White House and received a dressing down over trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Conor McGregor's remarks are wrong, and do not reflect the spirit of St Patrick's Day, or the views of the people of Ireland," the premier posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a sport that combines various combat techniques, and can be extremely violent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been gaining popularity, particularly as Trump campaigned in 2024 with stars and promoters of the UFC series that is popular with many male voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicknamed "The Notorious," McGregor is one of the biggest stars in UFC, the most famous and lucrative MMA league. He is known for his aggressive, provocative temperament and noted for occasional anti-immigration outbursts.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November 2024 the fighter was ordered by an Irish court to pay damages to a woman who claimed that McGregor "brutally raped and battered" her in a hotel in Dublin in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor claimed they had consensual sex.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, the Irishman was sued in a US court in January, accused of sexual assault at an NBA game in Miami in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was meanwhile ordered by a New York jury in a civil trial in 2023 to pay US$5 million for sexually abusing and defaming writer E Jean Carroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump denied the allegations and appealed the verdict, which was upheld in December 2024. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than nine months aboard the International Space Station, a pair of astronauts are finally set to depart for Earth early Tuesday, ending a prolonged mission that has captivated global attention.
 <br>
  <br>
  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams flew to the orbital lab in June last year, on what was supposed to be a days-long roundtrip to test out Boeing's Starliner on its first crewed flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the spaceship developed propulsion problems and was deemed unfit to fly them back, instead returning empty without more major problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ex-Navy pilots Wilmore and Williams, 62 and 59 respectively, were instead re-assigned to the Nasa-SpaceX Crew-9 mission, which saw a Dragon spacecraft fly to the ISS last September with a team of two, rather than the usual four, to make room for the "stranded" pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, early Sunday, a relief team called Crew-10 docked with the station, their arrival met with broad smiles and hugs as they floated through the hatch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crew-10's arrival clears the way for Wilmore and Williams to depart, along with American Nick Hague and Russian astronaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.
  <br>
  <br>
  If all goes smoothly, the Dragon craft will deploy its parachutes off the coast of Florida for an ocean splashdown, where a recovery vessel will retrieve the crew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams' stay surpasses the standard six-month ISS rotation but ranks only sixth among US records for single-mission duration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Challenges such as muscle and bone loss, fluid shifts, and readjusting to gravity are well understood and well managed. (AFP)

    Indonesia to repatriate hundreds of scam workers

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 500 Indonesians freed from online scam centres in Myanmar are expected to be repatriated via Thailand in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cyberscam operations, which have thrived in Myanmar's lawless border areas for several years, lure foreign workers with promises of high-paying jobs but hold them hostage and force them to commit online fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 7,000 workers from at least two dozen countries have been freed in recent weeks, the majority of them Chinese, but many have been languishing in squalid temporary holding camps on the border between Myanmar and Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  400 Indonesian nationals will return home on Tuesday and around 160 are to come back on Wednesday, Judha Nugraha, the director of citizen protection at Indonesia's foreign ministry, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  They would come back on three flights from Bangkok after crossing into Thailand from Myanmar, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesian authorities already repatriated 140 nationals from Myanmar via Thailand last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in Myanmar, under pressure from ally China, have cracked down on the scam compounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Indonesians have been enticed abroad in recent years to other Southeast Asian countries for better-paying jobs, only to end up in the hands of transnational scam operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between 2020 and September last year, Jakarta repatriated more than 4,700 Indonesians entangled in online scam operations from countries including Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, according to foreign ministry data.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations estimates that as many as 120,000 people - many of them Chinese men - may be working in Myanmar scam centres against their will. (AFP)

    Kiribati eyes deep-sea mining deal with China

<img alt="View of Kiribati's Parliament House. Kiribati opened discussions with China after a deal with Canada's The Metals Company fell through. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796176_1_20250318084916.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pacific nation Kiribati says it is exploring a deep-sea mining partnership with China, dangling access to a vast patch of Pacific Ocean harbouring coveted metals and minerals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati opened discussions with Chinese ambassador Zhou Limin after a longstanding agreement with leading deep-sea mining outfit The Metals Company fell through.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talk provides an exciting opportunity to explore potential collaboration for the sustainable exploration of the deep-ocean resources in Kiribati," the government said on Monday evening in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pacific nations Kiribati, Cook Islands and Nauru sit at the forefront of a highly contentious push to mine the depths of the ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati holds rights for deep-sea mining exploration across a 75,000-square-kilometre swathe of the Pacific Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Through state-backed subsidiary Marawa Research, Kiribati had been working with Canada-based The Metals Company to develop the area's mineral deposits.
  <br>
  <br>
  That agreement was terminated "mutually" at the end of 2024, The Metals Company told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Metals Company said Kiribati's mining rights were "less commercially favourable than our other projects".
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm is racing to win regulatory approval that would make it one of the first companies to mine international waters on an industrial scale.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has partnerships with Kiribati's Pacific neighbours Nauru and Tonga.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the International Seabed Authority are currently meeting in Jamaica to thrash out the rules for deep-sea extraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Cook Islands struck a five-year agreement in February to cooperate in exploring the Pacific nation's seabed mineral riches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal did not include any exploration or mining licence. (AFP)

 Starbucks has been ordered to pay US$50 million to a customer who was burned when hot tea spilled on his lap at a California drive-through.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for Michael Garcia said the server who handed him three super-sized drinks in February 2020 did not push one of them into the cardboard cupholder properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  When he took the tray, the drink tipped over, "causing third degree burns to his penis, groin, and inner thighs," according to a statement from Trial Lawyers for Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a hospitalisation and multiple skin grafts, Michael has lived for five years with the disfigurement, pain, dysfunction, and psychological harm caused by the burns."
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which specialises in no-win-no-fee claims, said Starbucks had denied responsibility for Garcia's suffering, but before a jury trial had offered to settle for US$30 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the coffee giant balked at the demand for a public apology and a change in policy that Garcia wanted, so the case went to trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  A jury in Los Angeles on Friday awarded him US$50 million, a figure his attorneys said would eventually cost Starbucks more than US$60 million once pre-judgement interest, costs and attorneys' fees are added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starbucks Corporation consistently denied responsibility for five years, all the way up to and through trial, and attempted to escape responsibility," the lawyers' statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trial was a perfect example of frivolous defences and victim-blaming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proud of Michael for standing up for himself and having the courage to tell his story."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Starbucks said the company would appeal the award.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We sympathise with Mr Garcia, but we disagree with the jury's decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive," Jaci Anderson, director of corporate communications, said in a statement to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The case is redolent of a 1994 landmark legal action against McDonald's in New Mexico, when 79-year-old Stella Liebeck was awarded over US$2.8 million after spilling hot coffee on herself.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the award was reduced on appeal, the Liebeck case became a touchstone issue in US tort reform, and was often mocked as an example of how readily Americans resort to the law. (AFP)

    Carney says Canada must reduce reliance on US

<img alt="Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks during a bilateral meeting with Britain's Prime Minister. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796162_1_20250318063858.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Monday warned his country must reduce its reliance on the United States and would turn towards its "reliable" European allies instead on his first trip abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carney's transatlantic visit to British leader Keir Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron came after US President Donald Trump suggested his country could become part of the United States and threatened its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After succeeding Justin Trudeau last week, Carney conspicuously chose key European powers France and the United Kingdom, rather than the United States, for his first trip abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following talks with UK Prime Minister Starmer in London, Carney told journalists his country "must diversify" its trade and security ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What is clear is that our trade and our security relations are too reliant on the United States. We must diversify," the former Bank of England governor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's one of the reasons for which my first visit is to Paris and London."
  <br>
  <br>
  Underlining their "shared values" and "shared king", Starmer thanked Carney for his "approach to Ukraine", two days after the Canadian leader took part in a video conference on shoring up support for Kyiv hosted by his UK counterpart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's King Charles -- who is also head of state in Canada -- earlier welcomed Carney for talks at Buckingham Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's UK correspondent Gavin Grey said the king would have to play delicate balancing act between supporting Carney but also being cordial to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He [Trump] has described King Charles in very, very glowing terms... so the British are very keen to use that, they are very keen to get a trade deal with America, at least some form of a trade deal, and get that expedited," Grey explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the king at the same time wanted to make it absolutely clear, in the coded world in which the king has to live -- he can't take sides, he can't offer political advice out loud -- but he wanted to make it clear that he was very supportive of Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney had travelled to the British capital after meeting France's President Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing Canada as the "most European of non-European countries", Carney said his nation needed to boost ties with European allies like France while trying to retain positive relations with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney faces threats on three fronts: a trade war with Washington, Trump's threats to annex his country and looming elections at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's imposition of an escalating raft of import tariffs on Canadian goods has threatened to trigger a recession, and his scorn for Canadian sovereignty sent jitters through the former ally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opinion polls show a large majority of Canadian voters reject Trump's argument that their country would be better off as the "51st state of the United States".
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trade war is a threat to the economy of the vast country of 41 million people, which has long enjoyed a close US partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, France and Britain are among the Nato members that have maintained strong support for Ukraine's beleaguered government and military since Russia's all-out attack in February 2022, even as Trump's US administration has pushed Kyiv to make concessions to Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  London and Paris are putting together plans for a coalition security force in Ukraine and looking for allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada and France want a "solid and lasting peace, accompanied by robust guarantees that will protect Ukraine against any further Russian aggression," Macron said alongside Carney.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is in this spirit that we will... continue to demand clear commitments from Russia," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney told Macron, who also took part in Saturday's call hosted by Starmer on Ukraine, that both nations stood for "sovereignty".
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain is Canada's third-largest trading partner and France its eleventh at a time when Trump's tariffs and Canadian retaliatory measures are threatening trade with its huge southern neighbour -- destination of three-quarters of Canada's exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Canada also has a "Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement" with the European Union, which includes France.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, which now likewise includes Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first speech as prime minister, Carney said: "Security is a priority for this government... as is diversifying our trading and commercial relationships, of course, with both Europe and the United Kingdom."
  <br>
  <br>
  On his return leg, Carney will touch down in Iqaluit in Nunavut, the Canadian territory closest to the Danish autonomous country of Greenland -- another Trump target for annexation -- to "reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty". (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of people protested in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen on Monday, the Iran-backed rebels' Al-Masirah TV showed, two days after US attacks that left dozens dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators waved placards and assault rifles, chanting "Death to America, death to Israel", at a huge protest in the capital Sanaa, while rallies were also held in Saada, Dhamar, Hodeida and Amran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demonstrations were called by the rebel group's leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the capital, seized by the Houthis in 2014, giant Yemeni and Palestinian flags punctuated a sea of demonstrators at Al-Sabeen Square, the site of weekly protests throughout the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yemen will never back down -- we defy the Americans, we defy the Zionists," said a man shouting slogans to the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifty-three people died and 98 were wounded in Saturday's US attacks on Sanaa and other areas, according to the Houthi health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump ordered the attacks following months of Houthi attacks on the vital Red Sea maritime trade route, despite a pause since Gaza's ceasefire started in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In retaliation, the rebels claimed to have twice attacked a US aircraft carrier group within 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Huthis, part of Iran's "axis of resistance" against the US and Israel, launched scores of drone and missile attacks on passing ships and Israeli territory during the Gaza war, claiming solidarity with the Palestinians. (AFP)

 Belgium and Rwanda have announced the expulsion of each other's diplomats, as relations deteriorated over allegations about their respective roles in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kigali said it was severing diplomatic relations and giving Belgian diplomats 48 hours to leave the East African country, accusing Brussels of "using lies and manipulation to secure an unjustified hostile opinion of Rwanda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgium's foreign affairs minister Maxime Prevot said the move was "disproportionate and shows that when we disagree with Rwanda they prefer not to engage in dialogue." Brussels will reciprocate by declaring Rwandan diplomats persona non grata, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  African leaders have been trying to establish a lasting ceasefire in Congo, where the Rwandan government is accused of supporting an offensive by M23 rebels in eastern Congo. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Brands including Prada have cut ties with South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun amid controversy over his relationship with actress Kim Sae-ron, who was found dead in February.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old actor who gained popularity in South Korea and China over his role in hit drama series "My Love from the Star" and "Queen of Tears" has been accused of dating Kim Sae-ron when she was underage in a YouTube expose, citing testimonies from the actress' relatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luxury fashion group Prada said it mutually decided to end its collaboration with Kim when asked in a client service chat on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dinto, a South Korean cosmetic brand, also announced it was ending its advertising contract with Kim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have determined that there are substantial grounds rendering the fulfilment of the advertising contract unfeasible," the company said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Soo-hyun's agency Goldmedalist referred to a statement given on Friday, when it denied claims that the two were in a relationship dating back to 2015 when Kim Sae-ron was a minor. She was also managed by the agency, but her contract was not renewed in 2022; the same year that she was involved in a drunk driving incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldmedalist also said Kim Soo-hyun, who has not commented directly, had been unfairly linked to Kim Sae-ron's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim, who was 24 years old, was found dead at her home. Her career had suffered since the drunk driving incident, and local media reported that she was in debt and working part-time jobs to pay it off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldmedalist said the actress owed the company around 0.7 billion won, or HK$3.75 million, in damages and penalties as a result of the drunk driving case.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, Kim Sae-ron posted a photo of her with Kim Soo-hyun which was quickly deleted, prompting speculation that the two were a couple.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer representing the relatives of Kim Sae-ron said on Monday that the late actress had decided to post the photo in hopes of hearing back from Kim Soo-hyun. (Reuters)

    Mt Fuji entry fee set for hikers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hikers attempting any of Mount Fuji's four main trails will be charged an entry fee of 4,000 yen from this summer, after local authorities passed a bill on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A record influx of foreign tourists to Japan has sparked alarm about overcrowding on the nation's highest mountain, a once-peaceful pilgrimage site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, Yamanashi region, home to Mount Fuji, introduced a 2,000 yen entry fee plus an optional donation for the active volcano's most popular hiking route, the Yoshida Trail.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cap on daily entries and online reservations were also brought in on that trail by officials concerned about safety and environmental damage on Fuji's majestic slopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yoshida Trail fee will be doubled for this year's July-September climbing season, while neighbouring Shizuoka region passed a bill on Monday to also charge 4,000 yen for its three trails, which were previously free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks in part to the new restrictions, the number of climbers who tackled Mount Fuji declined to 204,316 last year, from 221,322 in 2023, environment ministry data shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although climber numbers continue to be eclipsed by pre-pandemic levels, "200,000 hikers is still huge," said Natsuko Sodeyama, a Shizuoka prefecture official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no other mountain in Japan that attracts that many people in the span of just over two months. So some restrictions are necessary to ensure their safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mount Fuji is covered in snow for most of the year, but during the summer hiking season many trudge up its steep, rocky slopes through the night to see the sunrise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symmetrical mountain has been immortalised in countless artworks, including Hokusai's "Great Wave". It last erupted around 300 years ago. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump says he plans to speak to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday about ending the war in Ukraine, adding discussions are already ongoing about "dividing up certain assets" between the warring parties.
 <br>
  <br>
  US officials had expressed optimism on Sunday that a Ukraine-Russia ceasefire deal could be reached in weeks after Washington proposed a halt in fighting in the three-year war after talks in Saudi Arabia, which Kyiv accepted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we'll be talking about land... we'll be talking about power plants," Trump said aboard Air Force One.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington and Kyiv's European allies are pressing Moscow to accept a halt in the fighting, but Putin has given no clear answer – instead listing a string of conditions and raising "serious questions" over the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's envoy for the conflict, Steve Witkoff, who met for several hours with Putin days ago, told CNN that he thinks "the two presidents are going to have a really good and positive discussion this week".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, he added, "really expects there to be some sort of deal in the coming weeks, maybe, and I believe that's the case".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday accused the Kremlin of not wanting to end the war. He warned that Moscow wanted to first "improve their situation on the battlefield" before agreeing to any ceasefire. (AFP)

 The Philippine Senate said on Monday it will conduct a formal probe of ex-president Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and swift handover last week to the International Criminal Court, which is to try him for alleged crimes against humanity.

  The 79-year-old, the first Asian former head of state charged by the ICC, stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups have said killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe was initiated by Senator Imee Marcos, sister of President Ferdinand Marcos but a close friend of Duterte's eldest daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two families have had a spectacular falling out since Marcos teamed with Duterte to win an election landslide in 2022. The latter has since been impeached on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As chairperson of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am calling for an urgent investigation into the arrest of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, an issue that has deeply divided the nation," Imee Marcos said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is imperative to establish whether due process was followed and to ensure that his legal rights were not just upheld but protected," she said, adding: "Our sovereignty and legal processes must remain paramount."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was arrested at Manila airport on March 11 after a brief trip to Hong Kong and flown to the Netherlands just hours later where he was turned over to the ICC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate has set a public hearing for Thursday and invited top police and other government officials to give evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imee Marcos has tracked a course largely independent from her brother on many issues, though she is running for re-election under the administration ticket for the May 12 midterm elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours after the arrest, she challenged the wisdom of the arrest of "poor president Duterte", warning that "this can only lead to trouble".
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, she declared: "I cannot accept what they did to [Duterte]." (AFP)

    Mass layoffs begin at Voice of America

<img alt="Contractual staff at Voice of America have been told they are terminated as of this end of this month. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796015_1_20250317104956.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration began mass layoffs at Voice of America and other US-funded media, making clear its intent to gut outlets long seen as critical for US influence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Just a day after all employees were put on leave, staff working on a contractual basis received an email notifying them that they were terminated at the end of this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractors were told that "you must cease all work immediately and are not permitted to access any agency buildings or systems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractors make up much of VOA's workforce and dominate staffing in the non-English language services, although recent figures were not immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many contractors are not US citizens, meaning they likely depend on their soon-to-disappear jobs for visas to stay in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Full-time VOA staff, who have more legal protections, were not immediately terminated but remain on administrative leave and have been told not to work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voice of America, created during World War II, broadcast around the world in 49 languages with a mission to reach countries deemed to be without media freedom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed an executive order on Friday targeting VOA's parent US Agency for Global Media in his latest sweeping cuts to the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency had 3,384 employees in the 2023 fiscal year. It had requested US$950 million for the current fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With VOA in limbo, some of its services have switched to playing music for lack of new programming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sweeping cuts also froze Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, formed in the Cold War to reach the former Soviet bloc, and Radio Free Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other US-funded outlets being gutted include Radio Farda, a Persian-language broadcaster blocked by Iran's government, and Alhurra, an Arabic-language network established after the Iraq invasion in the face of highly critical coverage by Qatar-based Al-Jazeera.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said on Saturday that "taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump regularly criticizes media coverage of him and has questioned the wisdom of funding VOA when it has a "firewall" ensuring its editorial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an editorial on the demise of VOA, China's Global Times tabloid said that "the monopoly of information held by some traditional Western media is being shattered."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multidimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughingstock of the times," it said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unusually vicious and damaging weather across multiple US states spawned violent tornadoes, blinding dust storms and fast-moving wildfires this weekend, leaving at least 37 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hailey Hart and her fiancé Steve Romero hunkered down with their three huskies inside their 1994 Toyota Celica as a tornado ripped apart their home Saturday in Tylertown, Mississippi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romero said he prayed out loud and hugged Hart as the car rolled onto its side, windows shattering, before it landed on its wheels again. After the twister passed, they could hear people nearby screaming for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was a bad dream come true,” Romero said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next door, Hart’s grandparents crawled out from the rubble of their destroyed house after they sought shelter in a bathroom as falling trees collapsed the roof.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Everything was coming down on us,” said Donna Blansett, Hart’s grandmother. “All I could do was pray to God to save us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  They escaped with just a few scratches and aches. Family members, friends and volunteers spent Sunday removing debris and salvaging anything they could find - some damp clothes, a photo album and a few toiletries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so happy you’re alive,” Hart said through tears, as she embraced her grandmother on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service said tornado watches had mostly expired, but dangerous winds were still possible in the Carolinas, east Georgia and northern Florida through Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dynamic storm that began Friday earned an unusual “high risk” designation from weather forecasters. Still, experts said it was not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least three people, including an 82-year-old woman, were killed in central Alabama when multiple tornadoes swept across the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Troy, Alabama, parks officials said the recreation centre where many residents had taken refuge had to be closed due to damage from overnight storms. No one was injured.
  <br>

   <br>
   Missouri resident Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing trapped neighbours found five bodies scattered in rubble on Friday night outside what remained of his aunt’s house in hard-hit Wayne County. Scattered twisters killed at least a dozen people in the state, authorities said.

    In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reeves announced that six people died and more than 200 were displaced after tornadoes sowed devastation across three counties. And in the northern part of the state, roads were inundated and some people were stranded by flood waters.
    <br>
    <br>
    Wind-driven wildfires caused extensive damage in Texas and Oklahoma and officials warned on Sunday that parts of both states would again face an increased risk of fire danger in the coming week.
    <br>
    <br>
    More than 130 fires were reported across Oklahoma and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed, Governor Kevin Stitt said.
    <br>
    <br>
    Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management spokesperson Keli Cain said two people were killed as a result of wildfires and weather.
    <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, dust storms spurred by high winds claimed almost a dozen lives on Friday.
    <br>
    <br>
    Eight people died in a Kansas highway pileup involving at least 50 vehicles, according to the state highway patrol. Authorities said three people also were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle. (AP)

    Stranded astronauts to return to Earth on Tuesday

<img alt="A Nasa livestream shows the SpaceX Dragon crew spacecraft approaching the International Space Station on Saturday, before docking a day later.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pair of US astronauts stuck for more than nine months on the International Space Station will be returned to Earth on Tuesday evening, Nasa said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are to be transported home with another American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, which arrived at the ISS early on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stranded duo have been on the ISS since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa said in a statement on Sunday evening that it had moved forward the astronauts' anticipated ocean splashdown off the Florida coast to Tuesday evening. It was initially slated for no sooner than Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favourable weather conditions expected for later in the week," the space agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos astronaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will also return on the Dragon capsule, with the journey to be broadcast live from Monday evening when hatch closure preparations begin.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Wilmore and Williams, it will mark the end of an ordeal that has seen them stuck for nine months after what was meant to have been a days-long roundtrip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their prolonged stay was significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russia's Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station. (AFP)

    UK finance minister to unveil plan to cut red tape

<img alt="Regulators will be summoned to Downing Street to hear Rachel Reeves' action plan to cut the administrative cost of regulation on business. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795990_1_20250317085014.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's Labour government will on Monday set out details of how it plans to slash red tape to boost business, as it struggles to deliver growth nine months after winning power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chancellor Rachel Reeves' shake-up comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer took aim at the nation's "flabby state", sparking anger from unions who called on him to avoid the "incendiary rhetoric" of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance ministry said regulators would be summoned to the prime minister's Downing Street office on Monday to hear Reeves announce her "action plan to deliver on the pledge to cut the administrative cost of regulation on business by a quarter".
  <br>
  <br>
  The "radical" plan would cut "costly red tape" such as the "hundreds of pages of guidance on protecting bat habitats which goes far beyond legal requirements", said a statement, referring to the £100 million (US$130 million) spent on a bat tunnel by the company building Britain's new high-speed HS2 train line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel has become a lightning rod for criticism of the planning system, with the Prime Minister describing it as "absurd".
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of regulators will also be cut under Reeves' plan, saving businesses "billions of pounds", the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer on Thursday announced that he was axing NHS England which has run the state-run National Health Service in that nation since 2012, in a move seen as a dramatic shift to the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has dubbed NHS England "the world's largest quango" (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation).
  <br>
  <br>
  Its abolition was the "beginning not the end" and more health-related quangos would also face the chop, Health Secretary Wes Streeting wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour ousted former prime minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative government in a landslide election victory last July but has seen its popularity ratings fall during a bumpy start.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is under pressure to deliver on its election promise to kickstart economic growth while keeping prices under control amid a prolonged cost of living crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The central bank in February slashed its forecast for UK economic growth and warned that inflation would rise more than expected this year, blaming global risks amid US tariff threats and deteriorating business confidence in the UK. (AFP)

    Hospitalised Pope Francis addresses frailty

<img alt="Children holding balloons gather by the statue of John Paul II outside the Gemelli University Hospital where Pope Francis is hospitalised, in Rome. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795960_1_20250316215620.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis acknowledged being fragile and "facing a period of trial", as he thanked well-wishers on Sunday for prayers in a message from hospital, where he has been slowly recovering from pneumonia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pope, who has weathered his setbacks along with periods of improvement since being hospitalised on February 14, sent a particularly personal message to the faithful that referenced both his faith and his frailty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am sharing these thoughts with you while I am facing a period of trial, and I join with so many brothers and sisters who are sick: fragile, at this time, like me," wrote the pope in the message published by the Vatican.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our bodies are weak but, even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope," he added in the message marking the second Sunday of Lent, a 40-day period of prayer and reflection leading up to Easter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday was the fifth time in a row the pope's illness had prevented him from personally giving the Angelus prayer, usually delivered to a crowd gathered in St Peter's Square following mass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Francis has yet to appear at the window of his papal suite on the 10th floor of the Gemelli hospital, that has not dissuaded a steady stream of well-wishers from gathering.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, dozens of children including scouts from a Catholic group stood at the foot of a statue of Pope John Paul II at the hospital's entrance, holding yellow and white balloons and vainly striving to catch a glimpse of the pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You see the pope there!" shouted one of them eagerly, before being set straight by the group leader, Valerio Santobonio, 23: "I don't think that's him."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday we had some drawings made specifically to give to the Holy Father," Santobonio told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the boys and girls, aged from five to seven, don't quite yet grasp who the pope is, nor his health situation, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite not appearing at the window to wave, Francis addressed his youngest well-wishers in his message.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to 'Gemelli' as a sign of closeness," Francis wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you, dearest children! The pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week the Vatican signalled that the Argentine Jesuit was out of danger after a series of breathing crises earlier in his hospitalisation had sparked fears for his life.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the Vatican said Francis's condition continued to be stable and showing progress, as it has for the past week, but cautioned he still needed therapies administered within the hospital setting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Holy Father still requires hospital medical therapy, motor and respiratory physiotherapy; these therapies, at present, are showing further, gradual improvements," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That message appeared to quash speculation that the pope's progress could signal an imminent release from hospital. (AFP)

 The first US strikes against Yemen's Houthis since Donald Trump took office killed 31 people, the rebels said on Sunday, with the US president warning "hell will rain down upon" the Iran-backed group if it did not stop attacking shipping.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis, who have attacked Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, said children were among those killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attacks on Sanaa, as well as on areas in Saada, Al-Bayda and Radaa, killed at least 31 people and wounded 101, "most of whom were children and women", Houthi health ministry spokesperson Anis Al-Asbahi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage on Houthi media showed children and a woman among those being treated in a hospital emergency room, including a dazed girl with blackened legs wrapped in bandages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in a post on social media, vowed to "use overwhelming lethal force" to end the Houthi attacks, which the rebels say are in solidarity with Palestinians amid the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  After halting their attacks when a ceasefire took effect in Gaza in January, the Houthis announced on Tuesday that they would resume them until Israel lifted its blockade of aid to the devastated Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late on Saturday, a plume of white smoke had risen over Sanaa after explosions rocked the northern district of the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Houthis sealed off areas around the blast sites, making it impossible to gauge the true scale of the destruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohammad Albasha, a US-based consultant, said the area targeted in Sanaa was home to senior Houthi leaders and considered their stronghold in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the point of no return, and from now on, it's gloves off between the Houthis and CENTCOM," he said, referring to the regional US military command.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amal, 29, who lives with her mother in Sanaa, said Saturday's attacks were "terrifying... windows were shattered and the walls of the house shook".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Several military operations against the Houthis have been announced, but they've only added more casualties, most of them civilians."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The homes and locations of the leaders are well-known, but the victims are always civilians." (AFP)

 A fire that tore through a nightclub in North Macedonia killed 59 revellers attending a hip-hop concert at the venue, with more than 100 wounded, the country's interior minister said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out in "Pulse", a nightclub in the eastern town of Kocani, where more than 1,000 mostly young fans had crammed in to see the hip-hop duo DNK popular in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to the data we have by now, 59 persons lost their lives," interior minister Pance Toskovski said after visiting the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 100 persons are injured," Toskovski said, adding that the wounded had been transported to the local hospital in the town as well as to the capital Skopje and the town of Stip some 30 kilometres to the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  The concert kicked off around midnight, while online media outlet SDK, reported that the fire started about three hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Toskovski, the fire was probably caused by the use of pyrotechnic devices "used for light effect at the concert".
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment of activating the so-called sprinklers, the sparks caught the ceiling that was made of easily flammable material after which for a very short period of time the fire spread across the whole discotheque, creating a thick smoke" Toskovski said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Helicopters ferried some of the wounded to the capital Skope's hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted on social networks and shot before the fire show the use of stage jets, a type of indoor fireworks used during concerts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other videos published by media in the Balkan country show the entrance to the building blackened by flames.

 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke on Saturday to discuss the next stage in talks on ending Moscow's war against Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, the top diplomats "agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement gave no details on when the next round of US-Russia talks, which are being hosted by Saudi Arabia, would begin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also updated Lavrov on military activity in the Middle East, where US forces carried out deadly strikes on Saturday against Huthi rebel targets in Yemen, the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite recent tensions between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, Kyiv has agreed in principle to a US-brokered 30-day unconditional ceasefire if Moscow halts its attacks in eastern Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's President Vladimir Putin has not however agreed to any truce, instead setting conditions that were beyond what was called for in the US agreement with Ukraine. (AFP)

    US launches large-scale strikes against Yemeni Houthis

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 19 were killed as US President Donald Trump launched large-scale military strikes against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis on Saturday over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping, warning "hell will rain down" on them if they do not stop.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump also warned Iran, the Houthis' main backer, that it needed to immediately halt support for the group. He said if Iran threatened the United States, "America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The unfolding strikes - which one official said would last days and maybe weeks - represent the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since Trump took office in January. It came as the United States ramps up sanctions pressure on Tehran while trying to bring it to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 13 civilians were killed and nine injured in US strikes on Yemen's capital Sanaa, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six others, including four children and one woman, were killed and 11 were injured in a US strike on the northern province of Saada, the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis' political bureau described the attacks as a "war crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to respond to escalation with escalation," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents in Sanaa said the strikes hit a building in a Houthi stronghold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The explosions were violent and shook the neighbourhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children," one of the residents, who gave his name as Abdullah Yahia, told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis, an armed movement that took control of most of Yemen over the past decade, have launched more than 100 attacks targeting shipping since November 2023, disrupting global commerce and setting the US military on a costly campaign to intercept missiles and drones that burned through stocks of US air defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis say the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's other allies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, have been severely weakened by Israel since the start of the Gaza conflict. Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who was closely aligned with Tehran, was overthrown by rebels in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  But throughout, Yemen's Houthis have remained resilient and often on the offensive, sinking two vessels, seizing another and killing at least four seafarers in an offensive that disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US administration of former President Joe Biden had sought to degrade the Houthis' ability to attack vessels off its coast but limited the U.S. actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Trump has authorised a more aggressive approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes on Saturday were carried out in part by fighter aircraft from the Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, which is in the Red Sea, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US military's Central Command, which oversees troops in the Middle East, described Saturday's strikes as the start of a large-scale operation across Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Houthi attacks on American ships & aircraft (and our troops!) will not be tolerated; and Iran, their benefactor, is on notice," Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. "Freedom of Navigation will be restored."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump held out the prospect of far more devastating military action against Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective," Trump wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump’s proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,” he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. “A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,” Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 , a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.

    Gaza civil defence says Israeli strikes kill 9

<img alt="Hamas says the Israeli strikes on Beit Lahia violate the Gaza truce deal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795885_1_20250315222731.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said nine people, including journalists, were killed in Israeli strikes in the north on Saturday, an attack Hamas denounced as a "blatant violation" of the fragile ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Nine martyrs have been transferred (to hospital), including several journalists and a number of workers from the Al-Khair Charitable Organisation, as a result of the occupation targeting a vehicle with a drone in the town of Beit Lahia, coinciding with artillery shelling on the same area," said civil defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory reported that "nine martyrs and several injured, including critical cases, have arrived at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza Strip, due to the ongoing Israeli aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Israeli military said it struck "two terrorists... operating a drone that posed a threat to IDF troops in the area of Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Later, a number of additional terrorists collected the drone operating equipment and entered a vehicle. The IDF struck the terrorists," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the strikes, Hamas accused Israel of violating the Gaza truce deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The occupation (Israel) has committed a horrific massacre in the northern Gaza Strip by targeting a group of journalists and humanitarian workers, in a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of Hamas-affiliated media in Gaza, Ismail Thawabteh, said that local photo journalists were killed while "using a drone to capture images of a Ramadan dining table in Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they were "directly targeted by the occupation in two air strikes, despite their work being clear."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has carried out near-daily air strikes in Gaza since early March, often targeting what the military said were militants planting explosive devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce in Israel's war with Hamas, in effect since January 19, has largely held despite the attacks and with no agreement yet on extending the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the truce ended on March 1, but both Israel and Hamas have refrained from returning to all-out war. (AFP)
