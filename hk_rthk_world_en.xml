<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada's incoming prime minister Mark Carney has promised a "smooth" and "quick" transition from Justin Trudeau after his convincing win in the ruling Liberal Party's leadership race.
 <br>
  <br>
  But speaking on,
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>

   </u>
  </a>
  , Professor Al Reyes of the University of Hong Kong told Carol Musgrave that Carney's tough position on President Donald Trump meant that relations between the US and Canada would continue to be fraught.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He made very clear that the retaliatory tariffs that he imposed would remain until there is stability or at least some resolution to the current tariff war, so one can expect 'Trumpy times'... they've been already fraught under [Justin] Trudeau and these waning days, I think they will continue to be once [Mark] Carney takes over," Reyes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming general election will be a major test for Carney, a former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, who has never served in parliament nor held any elected public office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He does not have a seat in parliament. That's one reason why it would be more likely that a general election would be called very soon, because he has to get a seat in parliament... I think the key challenges for him, not just trying to figure out how to deal with the United States, but also what are the alternatives in terms of trade and investment if relations with the United States are so difficult."
  <br>
  <br>
  Reyes added that domestically, the cost of housing, eliminating the carbon tax and immigration would be key issues for Carney going forward.

    Arrest of pro-Palestinian student sparks outrage

<img alt="A demonstrator is detained by police officers during a protest following the arrest by US immigration agents of Palestinian student protester Mahmoud Khalil, in New York City. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795219_1_20250311105218.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Protesters in New York and rights groups expressed outrage on Monday over the arrest of a leader of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University, as President Donald Trump vowed further crackdowns.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate and one of the most prominent faces of the university's high-profile protests, was arrested by US immigration officials over the weekend despite holding a permanent residency green card.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Homeland Security, confirming Khalil's arrest on Sunday, claimed he had "led activities aligned to Hamas" and that the DHS action was taken "in coordination with the Department of State."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it," the president wrote on Monday on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the first arrest of many to come," he pledged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protests at Columbia, launched last year in opposition to Israel's devastating war in Gaza, brought widespread media attention as tensions mounted on campus and spread to other universities around the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and other Republicans have broadly accused the protesters of supporting Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Trump administration moves to quickly deport Khalil, who has reportedly been moved to the southern state of Louisiana, a federal judge on Monday ordered authorities to halt proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) condemned Khalil's arrest, calling it "unprecedented, illegal, and un-American."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government's actions are obviously intended to intimidate and chill speech on one side of a public debate," said Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday afternoon, over 1,000 protesters gathered in New York to express their outrage at Khalil's arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was essentially a kidnapping," said 42-year-old Tobi, who declined to give her last name for fear of retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems like a clear targeting of activists, which is a really, really dangerous precedent," she said. (AFP)

<img alt="Footage shows flames and smoke rising from a collision between an oil tanker and a cargo ship off the northeastern coast of England. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795210_1_20250311093602.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK coastguard ended the search for a missing crew member after a cargo ship ran into a US-military charted tanker carrying jet fuel in the North Sea on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  HM Coastguard rescued 36 crew members from the Stena Immaculate tanker and Solong container vessel, with one taken to hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One crew member of the Solong remains unaccounted for. After an extensive search for the missing crew member sadly they have not been found and the search has ended," said Matthew Atkinson, Divisional Commander for HM Coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Images showed a huge plume of thick, black smoke and flames rising from the scene about 16 kilometres off the east England coast, sparking concerns of "multiple toxic hazards".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Stena Immaculate tanker was "anchored off the North Sea coast near Hull...
  <br>
  [and] was struck by the container ship Solong", the Stena's US-based operators Crowley said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Stena was on a short-term US military charter with Military Sealift Command, according to Jillian Morris, the spokesperson for the command that operates civilian-crewed ships providing ocean transport for the US Defense Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowley said the impact of the collision "ruptured" the tanker "containing A1-jet fuel" and triggered a fire, with fuel "reported released".
  <br>
  <br>
  It was carrying around 220,000 barrels of jet fuel while the Solong was carrying 15 containers of sodium cyanide, according to the Lloyd's List information service, but it is not known if any of the flammable compound had leaked.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two vessels were still on fire 12 hours after the collision, said the coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the situation "extremely concerning".
  <br>
  <br>
  All crew members aboard the Stena Immaculate were confirmed to be alive, a spokeswoman for the tanker's Swedish owner, Stena Bulk, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alarm about the crash near the port city of Hull in East Yorkshire was raised at 0948 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  A coastguard helicopter, a plane, lifeboats from four towns and other nearby vessels were part of the large rescue operation, UK Coastguard said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 25 people were killed in two separate bus crashes in Mexico on Monday, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the country's north, 14 people died in a fiery collision between a tractor-trailer and a bus carrying passengers from the US state of Texas, civil protection authorities in Durango state said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 24 people travelling in the bus, only 10 managed to get out alive, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In southern Mexico, a bus turned over along a highway in Oaxaca state, killing 11 people, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twelve others were taken to the hospital with injuries, two of them in critical condition, the Oaxaca state government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I extend my heartfelt condolences to the victims' families, to whom we will provide the necessary support and assistance during this difficult time," Oaxaca Governor Salomon Jara said on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a interview on local radio on Monday afternoon, the state's interior minister, Jesus Romero, said the bus was carrying more than 40 people and was en route to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico's south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romero said it seemed that the passengers were heading home after attending a rally held on Sunday by President Claudia Sheinbaum in the capital Mexico City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities will launch an investigation into the cause of the accident, which happened near the community of Santo Domingo Narro, it said. (Agencies)

    Musk claims X targeted in 'massive cyberattack'

<img alt="More than 40,000 users reported having no access to the platform, according to the tracking website Downdetector.com. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795191_1_20250311082846.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk said his social media platform, X, has been targeted in a “massive cyberattack", hours after a series of outages on Monday left it unavailable to thousands of users.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources," Musk claimed in a post. "Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing..."
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Monday, Musk said on Fox Business Network’s Kudlow that the attackers had “IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area" without going into detail on what this might mean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cybersecurity experts quickly pointed out, however, that this doesn't necessarily mean that an attack originated in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security researcher Kevin Beaumont said on Bluesky that Musk's claim is “missing a key fact - it was actually IPs from worldwide, not just Ukraine.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, he said it was a Mirai variant botnet, which is made of compromised cameras. He said while he is not sure who is behind the attack, it “Smells of APTs - advanced persistent teenagers.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Allan Liska of the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, meanwhile, pointed out that even if “every IP address that hit Twitter today originated from Ukraine (doubtful), they were most likely compromised machines controlled by a botnet run by a third party that could be located anywhere in the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 40,000 users reported having no access to the platform, according to the tracking website Downdetector.com. By Monday afternoon, the reports had dropped to the low thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sustained outage that lasted at least an hour began at noon, with the heaviest disruptions occurring along the US coasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Downdetector.com said that 56 percent of problems were reported for the X app, while 33 percent were reported for the website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk bought the former Twitter in 2022 and also serves as the CEO of Tesla. (AP)

    EU says US not engaging to make deal to avoid tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States does not appear to want to make a deal with Brussels to avoid hefty tariffs against the EU, the bloc's trade chief said on Monday, days before US steel and aluminium levies kick in.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US administration does not seem to be engaging to make a deal," said Maros Sefcovic, who travelled to Washington last month in the hopes of reaching an agreement to avert a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump has taken aim squarely at the European Union, charging last month that the bloc was formed "to screw" the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Trump's 25-percent tariffs across steel and aluminium imports are due to take effect, affecting the EU as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea and other trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU has said it will respond firmly if the levies come into force.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US is watching over their interest, so is the European Union. Therefore, we will always protect European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified tariffs because we know that they expect no less from us," Sefcovic told reporters in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trade commissioner stressed that the EU remained open to dialogue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to have a constructive and positive relationship with the United States of America. And therefore, I would highlight once again that our doors are open for constructive engagement," Sefcovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also insisted the "overall picture" showed EU-US trade relations were balanced and mutually beneficial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States is Europe's largest investor, and vice versa, with US$5.7 trillion worth of investment in each others' markets based on 2022 data, according to EU figures. (AFP)

<img alt="A man walks outside at the Southern Gaza Desalination plant, which stopped working earlier after Israel cut off electricity supply to the Gaza Strip. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795152_1_20250310203138.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel is due to send a delegation to Qatar on Monday for a fresh round of talks on extending a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, after cutting off the electricity supply to the besieged enclave.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the deal expired at the beginning of March with no agreement on subsequent stages that should secure a lasting end to Israel's war in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas accused Israel of reneging on the ceasefire deal, saying in a statement on Monday Israel "refuses to commence the second phase, exposing its intentions of evasion and stalling".
  <br>
  <br>
  Media reports said a top official from the domestic security agency Shin Bet will lead Israel's delegation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has halted aid deliveries to Gaza amid the deadlock, and on Sunday announced it was cutting off the territory's electricity supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will use all the tools at our disposal to bring back the hostages and ensure that Hamas is no longer in Gaza the day after" the war, Energy Minister Eli Cohen said as he ordered the power cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move echoed the early days of the war when Israel announced a "complete siege" on the Palestinian territory, severing the electricity supply which was only restored in mid-2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanoua said Israel's move will impact its hostages still held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The decision to cut electricity is a failed option and poses a threat to its (Israeli) prisoners, who will only be freed through negotiations," Qanoua said in a statement on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany criticised Israel on Monday for its latest decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign ministry spokeswoman Kathrin Deschauer said Gaza was "again threatened with a food shortage" and that cutting off electricity was "unacceptable and not compatible with (Israel's) obligations under international law". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia said on Monday it was expelling two British "diplomats" on suspicion of carrying out espionage activities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russia's FSB security service said "counterintelligence work had revealed an undeclared British intelligence presence under the cover of the national embassy".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it was expelling the embassy's second secretary, whom it named as Alkesh Odedra, and the husband of the first secretary of the embassy's political department, identified as Michael Skinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both had "deliberately provided false information when obtaining a permit to enter our country, thus violating Russian legislation", the FSB said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian foreign ministry has revoked their accreditations and ordered them to leave Russia within two weeks, the FSB said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK blasted the move as unfounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the first time that Russia has made malicious and baseless accusations against our staff," a UK foreign ministry spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's foreign ministry also summoned an embassy representative in connection with the allegations, it said in a post on Telegram.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Moscow and London have been strained by intelligence scandals throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin years in power. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea fired "multiple unidentified ballistic missiles" on Monday, South Korea's military said, the same day Seoul and Washington began a major annual joint military drill known as Freedom Shield.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Our military has detected at around 4.50am GMT multiple unidentified ballistic missiles fired from Hwanghae province," the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our military will bolster surveillance and maintain a full readiness posture under close cooperation with the United States," the JCS added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States stations tens of thousands of US soldiers in South Korea, and the allies regularly stage joint drills, which they describe as defensive in nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such exercises infuriate Pyongyang, which regards them as rehearsals for invasion and routinely responds with weapons tests of its own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Monday, the nuclear-armed North slammed the drills as a "provocative act", warning of the danger of sparking war with "an accidental single shot".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a dangerous provocative act of leading the acute situation on the Korean peninsula, which may spark off a physical conflict between the two sides by means of an accidental single shot," said Pyongyang's foreign ministry, according to the Korean Central News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint US-South Korea "Freedom Shield 2025" exercise kicked off on Monday, and will involve "live, virtual, and field-based training", according to a US statement. (AFP)

    China to provide global trade stability: analyst

<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi pledged China would be a force for stability in an increasingly chaotic world, amid disputes between some of the major trading powers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An analyst on Monday agreed with Foreign Minister Wang Yi's statement at the "Two Sessions" last week that China ensured global stability.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zoon Ahmed Khan, a research fellow at the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, said on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , that the uncertainty from trade disputes between the world's major trading powers was creating instability, and that China was positioned to provide a steady hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world needs more certainty, the world needs more cooperation, he [Wang Yi] also mentioned the importance of multilateralism and upholding the UN system which is something that resonates with the vast majority of the world," Khan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sino-US trade tensions, Khan warned US President Donald Trump's tariffs could backfire on America.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These have not benefited the United States... he [Wang Yi] specifically mentioned that the US has to reflect, first of all, what has the impact of increased tariffs been on their own economy, on their own development."

    Freed scammers still trapped in Myanmar

<img alt="China repatriates its citizens freed from scam centres on to a chartered flight at Mae Sot International Airport on February 20, 2025. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795054_1_20250310092617.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first major global effort to crack down on the fast-growing industry of scamming is turning into a growing humanitarian crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  While a dramatic and highly-publicised operation by the Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities has led to the release of more than 7,000 people from online scam compounds in Myanmar, for many it is the beginning of another nightmare.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a month after the crackdown began, thousands of people are still detained in Myanmar, kept in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions by the armed groups that arranged their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Associated Press obtained exclusive photos of people squatting in rows, stacked against each other, surgical masks covering some of their eyes and mouths.
  <br>
  <br>
  In clandestine calls, survivors say they fear for their lives as illness is rampant and conditions are unsafe.
  <br>
  <br>
  They sleep on floors in army camps or former scam compounds guarded by armed militia groups. In one army camp, 800 people are sharing 10 toilets, one survivor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Getting home is dependent on the resources available by country.
  <br>
  <br>
  China sent a chartered flight to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up its citizens, but few other governments have matched that.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting on a Thai military base, stuck for want of a US$600 plane ticket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their plight has drawn concern from the US State Department and demands for their release from international human rights organisations, but Thai officials won't allow people to cross the border until their home countries arrange for them to leave immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are a handful of advocacy groups operating at the border helping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand is working with embassies to coordinate the release and handover of people, but said it can only handle up to 300 people per day, down from 500 initially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gangs running illegal scams have trapped hundreds of thousands of people in locked compounds in Myanmar, Cambodia and other places in Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victims say they were lured with promises of lucrative jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As outrage grew in China following the kidnapping of a young actor, Beijing pressured authorities in Thailand and Myanmar to act.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai government cut off power and electricity, and government-aligned armed groups that control areas near Myanmar's border with Thailand released several thousand people from scam centres. But no bosses were arrested. (AP)

    Trump declines to rule out 2025 US recession

<img alt='President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One "Who knows?", when asked on Sunday to clarify whether there could be a recession. Photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795044_1_20250310084801.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump declined on Sunday to rule out the possibility that the United States might enter a recession this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I hate to predict things like that," he told a Fox News interviewer when asked directly about a possible recession in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big - we're bringing wealth back to America," he said, adding, "It takes a little time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, was more definitive when asked on Sunday about the possibility of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Absolutely not," he told NBC's "Meet the Press" when asked whether Americans should brace for a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's on-again, off-again tariff threats against Canada, Mexico, China and others have left the US financial markets in turmoil and consumers unsure what the year might bring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock markets just ended their worst week since the November election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measures of consumer confidence are down, as shoppers - already battered by years of inflation - brace for the higher prices that tariffs can bring.
  <br>
  <br>
  And widespread government lay-offs being engineered by Trump's billionaire advisor Elon Musk add further concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked later on Sunday to clarify his remarks on whether there could be a recession, Trump told reports on Air Force One "Who knows?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the signs are mixed.
  <br>
  <br>
  A widely-watched Atlanta Federal Reserve index now predicts a 2.4 percent contraction of real GDP growth in the year's first quarter, which would be the worst result since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists at Goldman Sachs, citing Trump's policies, have raised their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15 percent to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Morgan Stanley predicted "softer growth this year" than earlier expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recessions are generally defined as two consecutive quarters of weak or negative GDP growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US was briefly in recession in early 2020 as the Covid pandemic spread. Millions of people lost jobs. (AFP)

    Mark Carney to succeed Trudeau as Canadian PM

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former central banker Mark Carney won the race to become leader of Canada's ruling Liberal Party and will succeed Justin Trudeau as prime minister, official results showed on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carney will take over at a tumultuous time in Canada, which is in the midst of a trade war with longtime ally the United States and must hold a general election soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, 59, beat former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland who came in second place in a contest in which just over 150,000 party members voted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau announced in January that he would step down after more than nine years in power as his approval rating plummeted, forcing the ruling Liberal Party to run a quick contest to replace him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a political novice, argued that he was best placed to revive the party and to oversee trade negotiations with US President Donald Trump, who is threatening additional tariffs that could cripple Canada's export-dependent economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney was the front-runner, with the most endorsements from party members and the most money raised among the four Liberal candidates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's win marks the first time an outsider with no real political background has become Canadian prime minister. He has said his experience as the first person to serve as the governor of two G7 central banks - Canada and England - meant he was the best candidate to deal with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the campaign, Carney said he supported dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs against the United States and a coordinated strategy to boost investment. He has repeatedly complained that Canada's growth under Trudeau was not good enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prospect of a fresh start for the Liberal Party under Carney, combined with Trump's tariffs and his repeated taunts to annex Canada as the 51st U.S. state, led to a remarkable revival of Liberal fortunes. (Reuters)

<img alt="Rescuers wade through flooded streets in Bahia Blance. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794956_1_20250309124021.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina's port city of Bahia Blanca has been "destroyed" after being pummelled by a year's worth of rain in a matter of hours, killing 13 and driving hundreds from their homes, authorities said Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two young girls -- reportedly aged four and one -- were missing after possibly being swept away by floodwaters in the wake of Friday's storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deluge left hospital rooms underwater, turned neighbourhoods into islands and cut electricity to swaths of the city. National Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said Bahia Blanca was "destroyed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll rose to 13 on Saturday, up from 10 on Friday, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor's office said more casualties were possible in this city of 350,000 residents, located 600 kilometres southwest of the capital Buenos Aires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The missing girls "may have been carried away by the water," Bullrich told Radio Mitre.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least five of the victims died on flooded roadways, possibly after being trapped in their cars by fast-rising water.
  <br>
  <br>
  The downpour, which began Friday morning, dumped more than 400 millimetres (15.7 inches) of rain in the area in just eight hours, "practically what Bahia Blanca gets in an entire year," provincial security minister Javier Alonso said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is unprecedented," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tempers flared Saturday as Bullrich and Defence Minister Luis Petri tried to visit an affected neighbourhood, with residents complaining they should have visited the area the previous night, according to a video shared on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some locals tried to drag Bullrich toward floodwaters, shouting "get wet!" and other abuse, before she was pulled away from the scrum by police and government officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  For environment official Andrea Dufourg, the extreme weather event "is a clear example of climate change."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately this will continue to take place... we have no other option than to prepare cities, educate citizens, establish effective early warning systems," said Dufourg, who is director of environmental policy for the city of Ituzaingo outside Buenos Aires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of evacuees on Saturday stood at 850, down from a peak of 1,321, according to the mayor's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm forced the evacuation of Jose Penna hospital, with news footage and video shared on social media showing nurses and other medical staff carrying babies to safety. They were later assisted by the army.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 1.5 meters of muddy water gushed into doctor Eduardo Seminara's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything is ruined," he told local channel C5N, pointing to a pile of soggy chairs, cushions and books dumped on the sidewalk.
  <br>
  <br>
  But "I'm not complaining, we didn't lose any lives, our family is fine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media showed images of flooded shops and reported overnight looting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has authorized emergency reconstruction aid of 10 billion pesos (US$9.2 million at the official exchange rate).
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm left much of the surrounding coastal area without power. At one point, city officials in Bahia Blanco suspended electricity due to the huge amount of water in the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bahia Blanca has suffered past weather-related disasters, including a storm in December 2023 that claimed 13 lives. It caused houses to collapse and provoked widespread infrastructure damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy rains also fell Friday night in the resort town of Mar del Plata, with officials suspending evening activities and urging people to remain indoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buenos Aires was also hit by the storm but suffered no major damage. (AFP)

 A man who climbed Big Ben's Elizabeth Tower at London's Palace of Westminster waving a Palestinian flag early on Saturday has come down after 16 hours, according to Sky News.
 <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported he shouted "free Palestine".
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency crews had gone up in a crane to negotiate with the man, and he came down after earlier telling negotiators he would come down "on his own terms", according to the Sky News report.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police earlier said they were alerted to the incident at Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) at 0724 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Officers are at the scene working to bring the incident to a safe conclusion. They are being assisted by the London Fire Brigade and the London Ambulance Service," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency services closed Westminster Bridge on Saturday morning in response to the incident, and parliamentary tours were also cancelled, according to Sky News. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis was doing physiotherapy on Saturday after passing a quiet night, the Vatican said, as the 88-year-old head of the global Catholic Church battles pneumonia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis "is going on with treatment and physiotherapy this morning", the Vatican said, having earlier issued a briefing which simply said his night had been "calm."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff, who had part of one of his lungs removed as a young man, has been in a special papal suite at Rome's Gemelli hospital since February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Argentine has suffered several respiratory crises since his admission, most recently on Monday, but for several days now the Vatican has described his condition as "stable."
  <br>
  <br>
  He is still in a "complex clinical condition," so "the prognosis remains guarded," it said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Francis released an audio message – the first time the world had heard his voice since he went into hospital – in which he thanked those praying for his recovery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff sounded weak and breathless despite marking three weeks of treatment at the Gemelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the Square. I accompany you from here," said Francis, taking laboured breaths every couple of words.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope on Friday mostly rested and prayed, including spending around 20 minutes in the little chapel inside the hospital's papal suite, the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He continues to switch between an oxygen mask at night and a cannula – a plastic tube tucking into the nostrils – delivering high-flow oxygen during the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been doing bits of work when possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin read aloud a message on the pope's behalf during a mass in St Peter's Basilica.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope had worked on the message from hospital just a few days ago, on March 5, the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a bid for greater transparency, the Vatican has been publishing an update on how the pope slept every morning, followed by a more detailed medical bulletin each evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, it said that "in view of the stability of the clinical picture," there would be no medical bulletin on Friday evening. The next is due later Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  During previous hospitalisations, the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics appeared on the Gemelli balcony for his weekly Sunday Angelus prayer.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he has missed the last three.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican press office said on Saturday that it was "quite probable" the Angelus would be delivered this Sunday "in the same way" as in previous weeks, when it was published as a letter released at noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope has suffered a series of health issues in recent years, from colon surgery in 2021 to a hernia operation in 2023, but this is the longest and most serious hospitalisation of his papacy. (AFP)

    OIC adopts Gaza counter-proposal by Arab League

<img alt="The OIC's decision came at an emergency meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794923_1_20250308192050.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) formally adopted early on Saturday an Arab League counter-proposal to US President Donald Trump's plan to take over Gaza and displace its residents, calling on the international community to support the regional initiative.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decision by the 57-member grouping came at an emergency meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, three days after the Arab League ratified the plan at a summit in Cairo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian-crafted alternative to Trump's widely condemned takeover plan proposes to rebuild the Gaza Strip under the future administration of the Palestinian Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The OIC "adopts the plan... on the early recovery and reconstruction of Gaza," it said in a communique.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body, which represents the Muslim world, urged "the international community and international and regional funding institutions to swiftly provide the necessary support for the plan."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump triggered global outrage when he suggested the US "take over" Gaza and turn it into the "Riviera of the Middle East," while forcing its Palestinian inhabitants to relocate to Egypt or Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty welcomed the OIC endorsement and said he now hoped to gain support from the wider international community, including the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The next step is for the plan to become an international plan through adoption by the European Union and international parties such as Japan, Russia, China and others," Abdelatty said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is what we will seek, and we have contact with all parties, including the American party."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Egyptian proposal – which does not outline a role for Hamas, which controls Gaza – has already been rejected by both the US and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan "does not meet the expectations" of Washington, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, however, gave a more positive reaction, calling it a "good-faith first step from the Egyptians."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's plan has united Arab countries in opposition, and Rabha Seif Allam, of the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, said Egypt was seeking "broad support" for its proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an attempt to build a broad coalition that refuses the displacement" of Palestinians from Gaza, she said. (AFP)

    S Korea's impeached President Yoon released

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was released from detention on Saturday after a court voided his arrest on procedural grounds – but he remains under investigation over his declaration of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president, who was detained in a dawn raid in January on insurrection charges over his December 3 attempt to subvert civilian rule, walked out of the detention centre smiling, before bowing deeply before a small crowd of cheering supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I bow my head in gratitude to the people of this nation," Yoon said in a statement released through his lawyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A day earlier, a court had cancelled his arrest warrant on technical and legal grounds – a decision that prosecutors probing Yoon said in a statement on Saturday was "unjust."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was freed after the prosecutors waived their right to appeal the court verdict, which was specifically about technical details of his detention on criminal charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also faces a separate Constitutional Court ruling on whether to uphold his impeachment and formally strip him from office, with the judges' decision expected any day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said that "given the Constitutional Court's ruling and related considerations, the Prosecutor General has instructed the team to actively present its arguments before the trial court instead" of appealing Yoon's release from detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea must hold a fresh presidential election within 60 days if Yoon is removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The criminal case against him will continue even if he is formally stripped of office. (AFP)

    Ex-Cyclone Alfred sparks flood warnings in Australia

<img alt="Alfred has battered the coastline with gale-force winds that toppled trees. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794891_1_20250308152018.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Cyclone Alfred stalled off the rain- and wind-lashed coast of eastern Australia on Saturday, threatening to unleash floods after blacking out more than a quarter of a million homes and businesses.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former tropical cyclone – now downgraded to a tropical depression – has battered the coastline with gale-force winds that toppled trees, brought down power lines, and damaged buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was still creating heavy rainfall, swelling rivers in parts of a 400-kilometre stretch of the coast straddling southeast Queensland and northeast New South Wales, government forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Utility companies said 295,000 properties in southeast Queensland and another 42,600 in New South Wales were without power, warning that floods could hamper repairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the weather system "stalled and began weakening," the bureau of meteorology warned that intense rain and damaging wind gusts were a risk throughout the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rivers are already starting to respond to the heavy rainfall, with many Minor to Major Flood Warnings current," the bureau said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man was missing after his four-wheel drive pick-up truck was swept off a bridge into a rain-engorged river the previous day in northern New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  He clambered out of the vehicle and tried in vain to cling to a tree branch in the river.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The man was swept from the tree and seen to go beneath the water where he has not been sighted since," police said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flooded roads and high winds made it too dangerous to send in crews or helicopters to search for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there were "grave concerns" for the man.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While it has been downgraded, very serious risks remain so it is important that people do not take this downgrading as a reason for complacency," Albanese told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its impact will be serious and will intensify over coming hours and indeed over coming days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuation orders have been issued for 16,200 people in New South Wales, where 30 flood rescues have been carried out over the past 24 hours, emergency services said.
  <br>
  <br>
  New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told a news conference the emergency was not over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not over for the following reasons: The rivers are full. The rain is continuing and is expected to keep falling in the days ahead. And wind conditions are very high and extreme," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Lismore – a northern New South Wales city hit by deadly floods in 2022 and a focus of concern in the past few days – the Wilsons River was no longer expected to spill over a 10.6-metre levee protecting inhabitants, forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paramedic Ginny Burke, 30, said she was at work when the wind uprooted a large gum tree that smashed through the house she is renting in Elanora on the Gold Coast in Queensland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burke said she returned to her crushed home, where her sister recounted that she had heard the tree fall on Friday evening but described the calamity as "really unexciting."
  <br>
  <br>
  "What can you do?" the paramedic asked. "It's just stuff. Everyone's safe." (AFP)

    'Hackman died of natural causes, a week after wife'

<img alt="Gene Hackman poses during the 60th annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. January 19, 2003. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794873_1_20250308114632.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife died of natural causes about a week apart, a medical examiner said on Friday, ending more than a week of mystery surrounding the death of one of Hollywood's most beloved stars.
 <br>
  <br>
  The bodies of "The French Connection" star and his wife were found on February 26 in their home in New Mexico after emergency services were called to their property.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of death for Mr. Gene Hackman, aged 95 years, is hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor," Heather Jarrell, the chief medical examiner for the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of death for Miss Betsy Hackman, aged 65 years, is hantavirus, pulmonary syndrome. The manner of death is natural."
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither body showed any sign of trauma, nor any indication of carbon monoxide poisoning, which had been an initial suggestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hantavirus presents as a flu-like disease, with symptoms including fever, muscle aches, cough, sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and cardiac or heart failure and lung failure, Jarrell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This occurs after a one- to eight-week exposure to excrement from a particular mouse species that carries hantavirus."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrell said data from Hackman's pacemaker showed its last activity over a week before his body was found when maintenance workers were unable to access the couple's sprawling Santa Fe property.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hagman probably died around February 18. Based on the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that Miss Hackman passed away first, with February 11 being the last time that she was going to be alive," said Jarrell.
  <br>
  <br>
  First responders found the door unlocked and open, and pills scattered next to Betsy Hackman's body, which was in the bathroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gene Hackman's body was found in another room, fully clothed, with sunglasses nearby, indicating a sudden fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dog was found dead in the bathroom, and two other healthy dogs were at the house.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to autopsies, the investigation had focused on piecing together a timeline of the couple's last days, which detectives said had been complicated by their low profile and their preference for privacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman, a two-time Academy Award winner, was credited for intense performances inspired by his troubled upbringing, notching up dozens of movie credits extending into his 70s.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is perhaps best known as vulgar New York cop Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle in the 1971 crime thriller "The French Connection", for which he won an Oscar for best actor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won another golden statuette two decades later for best supporting actor for his portrayal of the brutal small-town sheriff "Little Bill" Daggett in the 1992 western "Unforgiven." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten people died and hundreds were evacuated in the Argentine port city of Bahia Blanca on Friday as torrential rains flooded homes and hospitals, destroyed roads and forced authorities to cut the power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eight hours of nonstop rain left the city of 350,000 people largely under water, and forced authorities to evacuate the Jose Penna hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Television images showed medical personnel evacuating babies from the hospital's neonatal unit, and the army was deployed to assist in rescue efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 1,000 people were evacuated to safety in the city about 600 kilometers south of the capital Buenos Aires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Municipal officials said ten people were confirmed to have died, but the toll could still rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city received more than 400 millimeters of rain in just hours - equivalent to what it normally gets in a year, "something unprecedented," according to Javier Alonso, security minister for the Buenos Aires province.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest storm in Bahia Blanca was in 1930, with 175 millimeters. This is almost three times bigger," said Alonso.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bahia Blanca's airport was closed until further notice, and officials cut off part of the power supply to reduce the risk of electric shocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The provincial government said it was sending helicopters, canoes, ambulances and trucks bearing food, water and equipment to the stricken city.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coast guard was assisting in the rescue with inflatable boats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was raining, and suddenly we saw the street was flooded. About a meter-and-a-half of water came into my house," Flavia Viera Romero, who rescued her children from the deluge, told the LN+ channel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city remains on alert from the meteorological service for new storms. (AFP)

 President Donald Trump on Friday threatened new sanctions and tariffs on Russia over its bombardments of Ukraine, after previously suspending US aid to Kyiv in a stated bid to encourage diplomacy.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's threat comes after Russia launched major drone and missile attacks on Friday on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Days earlier, the Trump administration suspended US military aid deliveries and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine after a dispute with President Volodymyr Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Vice President JD Vance, on February 28, berated Zelensky in a televised meeting at the White House, accusing him of ingratitude for billions of dollars in US weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has since faced harsh criticism from allies and domestic opponents who say he has sided with Russia, which attacked Ukraine in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States voted with Russia and against its European allies on United Nations resolutions that called for ending the war without stressing Ukraine's territorial integrity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Trump spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin in an initial step toward resuming normal relations and undoing sweeping sanctions imposed under former president Joe Biden over the Ukraine assault. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A high-level Hamas delegation was in Cairo on Friday to advance efforts to prolong a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, which has largely paused hostilities with Israel, two senior Hamas officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The delegation will meet with Egyptian officials on Saturday to discuss the latest developments, assess progress in implementing the ceasefire agreement and address matters related to launching the second phase of the deal," said one official.
  <br>
  <br>
  During its talks with Egyptian mediators, the Hamas delegation will demand that Israel "implement the agreement, begin negotiations for the second phase, and open the border crossings to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian militant group seeks a "comprehensive agreement that ensures a permanent and complete ceasefire," the other official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hamas's demands for the second phase include a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, an end to the blockade, the reconstruction of the territory and financial support based on the decisions of this week's Arab summit in Cairo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire's first phase ended last weekend, after six weeks of relative calm that included exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Israel has said it wants to extend the first phase until mid-April, Hamas has insisted on a transition to the deal's second phase, which should lead to a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages taken by Palestinian militants during Hamas's October 2023 attack, which started the war, 58 remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military has said are dead. (AFP)

<img alt="The Gare du Nord station lies in northern Paris and is the country's busiest train hub. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794795_1_20250307191100.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of passengers in Paris and London were stranded on Friday, after the discovery of a World War II bomb on tracks leading to the Gare du Nord station halted traffic at France's busiest railway terminus.
 <br>
  <br>
  All traffic to the train station, which serves international, high-speed and local connections, was halted as police worked to disable the device. All Eurostar trains in Paris were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unexploded bomb was found "in the middle of the tracks" about 2.5 kilometres from the station overnight during maintenance work carried out in the northern Paris suburb of Saint Denis, the national SNCF rail company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bomb "dates back to World War II," the RER B suburban train firm, whose trains from Gare du Nord heading towards Charles de Gaulle airport have also been suspended, wrote in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gare du Nord station lies in the north of the French capital and is the country's busiest train hub, hosting the Eurostar trains in addition to regional and suburban service, according to the SNCF.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many passengers could not mask their irritation at the sudden change of plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been waiting since 6:00 am for an RER to Goussainville," said 55-year-old Corinne Schiavenato, referring to a town north of Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to take a replacement bus but it's impossible, too many passengers, they're packed. I'm self-employed, I have a client who has been waiting for me since 7:00 am."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others took the disruptions in stride.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's funny, I've just come back from Lorient where unexploded shells are discovered all the time," said Chloe Ternand, referring to a town in western France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot warned that rail traffic at Gare du Nord would remain "heavily disrupted all day" on Friday, which usually sees an increase in passengers due to weekend travel. (AFP)

    S Korea court orders Yoon's release, pending ruling

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court cancelled impeached President Yoon Suk-yeol's arrest warrant on Friday, paving the way for his release from jail following his arrest in mid-January on insurrection charges over a brief imposition of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Seoul Central District Court said in a statement that its ruling was based on the timing of the indictment that came after the initial detention period had expired, and noted "questions about the legality" of the investigation process that involved two separate agencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 15, Yoon became the first sitting president to be arrested on criminal charges after days of a standoff between presidential guards and arresting authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The court's decision to cancel the arrest showed this country's rule of law is still alive," Yoon's lawyers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers also said he may not be immediately released because prosecutors can appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutors' office did not immediately comment on the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence team had argued that a warrant issued on January 19 that extended Yoon's detention was invalid because the request filed by prosecutors was procedurally flawed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said his December 3 martial law declaration was needed to root out "anti-state" elements but lifted the decree six hours later after parliament voted to reject it. He has said he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks later he was impeached by the opposition-led parliament on accusations he had violated his constitutional duty by declaring martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court is expected to rule soon on his impeachment. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday said China's diplomacy provides much-needed stability in a turbulent world.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference during the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Wang was asked about China's role in the world on the diplomatic front.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's diplomacy will stand firm on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. We will provide certainty to this uncertain world. We will be a staunch force defending our national interests," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Global South, Wang said Beijing will continue to expand global partnerships and "write a new chapter of the Global South seeking strength through unity".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Global South, which accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's GDP, should strengthen themselves and strive for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  As China and the European Union mark 50 years of diplomatic relations this year, Wang said Beijing is still confident that Europe can be its trusted trading partner despite tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two sides have the capacity and wisdom to properly resolve pending issues through friendly consultation and jointly usher in another promising 50 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Wang accused the Philippines of creating frictions in the South China Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said trust and rules are needed to help bring lasting peace and security in the South China Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Taiwan, the foreign minister said the island is an inalienable part of China and any attempts to seek "Taiwan independence" are doomed to fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Taiwan has never been a country and will never be a country in the future,” Wang said, adding that China will realise complete reunification.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A weak and breathless Pope Francis thanked people for their prayers for his recovery in a remarkable audio message broadcast on Thursday, the first public sign of life from the 88-year-old pope since he was hospitalized three weeks ago with double pneumonia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis’ feeble voice, discernible through his labored breaths and in his native Spanish, was recorded from the hospital and broadcast to the faithful in St. Peter’s Square who had gathered for the nightly recitation of the rosary prayer.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the square, I accompany you from here,” he said, his soft voice piercing the hushed square.
  <br>
  <br>
  “May God bless you and the Virgin protect you. Thank you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For anyone used to hearing Francis’ voice, which is often so soft it sounds like a whisper, the audio was an emotional punch to the gut that hammered home just how sick he is.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cardinal presiding over the prayer, Cardinal Ángel Fernández Artime, had told the crowd at the start of the service that he had “beautiful news, a beautiful gift" to share.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clearly surprised crowd broke into applause and then applauded again after Francis’ final “Gracias.” Fernández Artime, for his part, bowed his head as he listened.
  <br>

    China will 'firmly counter' US amid trade row: Wang Yi

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China will "firmly counter" US pressure on trade, after Washington imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a press conference on Friday on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Wang also raised the risk that the "law of the jungle" could take hold in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China-US economic and trade ties are mutual. If you choose to cooperate, you can achieve mutually beneficial and win-win results. If you use only pressure, China will firmly counter," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the move by the Trump administration to impose additional tariffs using the fentanyl issue as a pretext, Wang said Washington should not "repay kindness with resentment, let alone impose arbitrary tariffs".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are around 190 countries in the world," he said. "Imagine if every country emphasised their own priority and believed in strength and status, the world would fall back into the law of the jungle.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Small and weak countries will get burnt first, and the international order and rules will be under severe shock.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Major countries should undertake their international obligations… and not seek to profit from and bully the weak.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the abuse of fentanyl in the US is a problem that must be confronted and resolved by the country itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the development of AI in China and growing popularity of DeepSeek, the foreign minister said "high fences and small yards" cannot suppress the spirit of innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Where there is blockade, there is breakthrough; where there is suppression, there is innovation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that China and the US must co-exist peacefully, and mutual respect is key to bilateral ties. (Agencies)

 China wants to achieve a "fair, lasting and binding peace agreement" acceptable to all parties on the Ukraine war, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone hopes to achieve a fair, lasting, binding peace agreement that every side can accept," Wang told reporters during an annual press conference on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to cooperate with the international community in accordance with the wishes of relevant parties to achieve a final resolution of the crisis and lasting peace, and will continue to play a constructive role."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that "conflict has no winners, and peace has no losers".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the foreign minister said ties with Russia were a "constant in a turbulent world" as he addressed the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A mature, resilient, and stable China-Russia relationship will not change due to temporary events, nor will it be disrupted by third-party interference," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Middle East, Wang called for a "lasting ceasefire" between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If major powers genuinely care about the people of Gaza, they should promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza and increase humanitarian assistance," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said China supports a plan by Egypt and other Arab countries to rebuild and restore peace in Gaza. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A New Mexico resident who has died, tested positive for measles, the state health department said on Thursday, marking the second measles-related death in the United States in more than a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unvaccinated adult patient did not seek medical care before death, and was the first measles-related death in the state in more than 40 years, according to David Morgan, Public Information Officer for the New Mexico Department of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of death is still under investigation by the state medical examiner, Morgan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death brings to 10 the number of measles cases that occurred in Lea County, located adjacent to Gaines County, Texas, where more than 100 cases and one death in an unvaccinated child have been reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outbreak, one of the largest the United States has seen in the past decade, has put US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a long-time vaccine sceptic, to the test.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a cabinet meeting last week, Kennedy initially downplayed news that a school-aged child had died of measles, calling such outbreaks ordinary and failing to mention the role of vaccination to prevent measles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, Kennedy published an opinion piece on Fox News that promoted the role of vaccination, but downplayed the role of vaccines by telling parents vaccination was a personal choice and urging them to consult with their physician.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed the role of vitamin A, overstating evidence for its use, which has only been shown to decrease measles severity in developing countries among individuals who are malnourished and vitamin A deficient, said Dr Paul Offit, an infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of February 27, 164 measles cases have been reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in nine jurisdictions: Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island, and Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measles typically kills 1 to 3 people per 1,000 cases, said Dr Tina Tan, an infectious disease expert at Northwestern University in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said two deaths out of a total of 164 cases suggest "a much higher mortality rate than we would normally see," adding that there are probably many undetected cases. (Reuters)

<img alt="President Trump listens as Rodolphe Saade, CEO of CMA CGM Group, speaks in the Oval Office. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794675_1_20250307092145.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday said French-based shipping firm CMA CGM would invest US$20 billion in the United States to build out shipping logistics and terminals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration wants to revive shipbuilding in the United States and weaken China's grip on the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's team is preparing an executive order that would impose a levy on ships linked to China when they call at US ports, and wants US allies to do the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM is the world's third-largest container shipping line and is part of a vessel-sharing alliance with companies including China's COSCO.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM said last week that US port fees on China-built ships would have a big impact on all shipping firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Thursday he would announce a new program for building ships in the United States next week or the following week, including incentives.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM CEO Rodolphe Saade, who joined Trump in the Oval Office, confirmed the US$20 billion investment and said it would create 10,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investment over four years would include expansion of container ports and the creation of an air cargo hub in Chicago supported by five new Boeing 777 freighters flown by American pilots, CMA CGM said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saade, a French-Lebanese billionaire who controls CMA CGM with other family members, told Trump at the White House that his group was looking at supporting the building of container ships and would make an announcement "in the coming weeks".
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM operates port terminals in New York and Los Angeles. The Marseille-based firm is the biggest cargo carrier for US retail giant Walmart. (Reuters)

    Cyclone Alfred edges closer to Australia's east coast

<div class="itemFullText">
 Violent winds toppled power lines on Friday as a tropical cyclone inched towards Australia's eastern coast, sparking evacuation orders and leaving more than 50,000 homes without electricity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred was 165 kilometres east of Brisbane city on Friday morning, crawling towards the densely-populated coastline at "walking speed", government forecasts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some four million people were in the firing line along a 400-kilometre stretch of coastline straddling the border of Queensland state and New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a region rarely troubled by typhoons - it has been more than 50 years since a tropical cyclone made landfall in that part of Queensland.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 50,000 homes were without power on Friday morning as damaging winds brought down power lines, officials and utility companies said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said the storm already "packed a punch", warning conditions would get worse as it approached land late on Friday or early Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency response officials said they had issued evacuation orders for some 10,000 people in the flood-prone northern rivers region of New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was particular concern for the town of Lismore, which was engulfed by record 14-metre floodwaters after heavy rains in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many residents have spent the past three days fortifying their homes with sandbags, tying down loose furniture and stocking up on food and water.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the region should "hope for the best, but prepare for the worst".
  <br>
  <br>
  "When nature does its worst, Australians are at our best. We rally. We lift each other up. We look out for our neighbours," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred would likely cross the coast "early Saturday morning", the Bureau of Meteorology said, although its path was becoming difficult to predict.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was forecast to make landfall around 60 kilometres north of Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 900 schools across Queensland state and neighbouring parts of northern New South Wales were closed on Friday, education department officials said. (AFP)

    SpaceX loses contact with Starship rocket after launch

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's SpaceX saw mixed results in the latest test launch of its Starship mega-rocket on Thursday, successfully catching the massive booster but with the upper stage failing for the second consecutive time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Minutes after lift-off and booster separation, a video live feed showed the upper stage tumbling uncontrollably, with signal soon cutting out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can confirm we did lose contact with the ship. Unfortunately, this happened last time, too," SpaceX official Dan Huot said, alluding to the January launch that saw the upper stage explode over the Caribbean, raining debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new setback could fuel questions over Musk's attention to his space company, as the billionaire spends most of his time in Washington leading US President Donald Trump's government overhaul efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  That work has also prompted mounted scrutiny over Musk's influence on the US government space program.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starship, the world's biggest and most powerful launch vehicle, successfully blasted off from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas shortly after 5:30 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Starship's eighth orbital mission - all so far uncrewed - and the first since its dramatic mid-air explosion over the Caribbean during its last trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite losing contact with the upper stage again, SpaceX managed to return the huge booster stage to the launch tower - catching it with arms called "chopsticks." It was the third time SpaceX completed the tricky engineering feat.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 minutes after the launch, Spacex turned off its livestream and the fate of the errant upper stage was not immediately known. (AFP)

    Trump backs off Mexico, Canada tariffs

<img alt="US President Donald Trump said after a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that fresh tariffs targeting Mexico would not apply to trade that falls under an existing regional pact. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794641_1_20250307042023.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled a temporary rollback to steep tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico, providing some reprieve to companies and consumers after blowback on financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  After his sweeping tariffs of up to 25 percent on the two US neighbors took effect on Tuesday, stock markets tumbled, while economists warned that blanket levies could weigh on US growth and raise inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed orders Thursday to delay fresh levies for Canadian and Mexican imports covered by a North American trade agreement, though he dismissed suggestions that his decisions were linked to market turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The halt, which lasts until April 2, came one day after the White House announced similar relief for automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following talks with the "Big Three" US automakers Stellantis, Ford and General Motors, Trump decided to give a one-month exemption on autos coming through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House official told reporters that about 62 percent of Canadian imports will still face the new tariffs, although much of these are energy imports hit by a lower rate of 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of Mexican imports come through the USMCA.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest moves make conditions "much more favorable for our American car manufacturers," Trump said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added that major moves would be unveiled on April 2, the date that he has promised "reciprocal tariffs" to remedy practices Washington deems unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  At that point, Canadian and Mexican goods could still face levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president also said he would not modify broad tariffs for steel and aluminum, which are due to take effect next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office that he had a "very good conversation" with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  His remarks stood in sharp contrast to the simmering tensions with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said on Thursday that Ottawa will remain in a trade war with Washington for "the foreseeable future" even if there are "breaks for certain sectors." (AFP)

    World's sea ice cover hits record low in February

<img alt="In the Antarctic the frozen cover was 26 percent below average across February. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794625_1_20250306221837.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global sea ice cover fell to a historic low in February when the world continued to experience exceptional heat, and temperatures reached 11 degrees Celsius above average near the North Pole, Europe's climate monitor said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Copernicus Climate Change Service said last month was the third hottest February on record, continuing a run of persistent warming since 2023 stoked by greenhouse gas emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Combined Antarctic and Arctic sea ice cover – ocean water that freezes and floats on the surface – dropped to a record minimum extent of 16.04 million square kilometres on February 7, Copernicus said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "February 2025 continues the streak of record or near-record temperatures observed throughout the last two years," said Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs Copernicus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the consequences of a warmer world is melting sea ice, and the record or near-record low sea ice cover at both poles has pushed global sea ice cover to an all-time minimum."
  <br>
  <br>
  The poles are the most sensitive regions to climate change on the planet, warming several times faster than the global average.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arctic ice cover, which normally expands to its annual winter maximum in March, was a historic February low last month, eight percent below average, Copernicus said. That marked the third monthly record in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Antarctic, where it is now summer and the ice is melting, the frozen cover was 26 percent below average across February, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Antarctic region may have hit its annual low point towards the end of the month, Copernicus said, adding that if confirmed, this would be the second-lowest daily minimum coverage in the satellite record. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 EU leaders gathered with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday in Brussels in search of unity on bolstering Ukraine and Europe's defences, after US President Donald Trump upended traditional US alliances and retracted wartime backing for Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's summit brings all 27 EU leaders together for the first time since last week's explosive meeting between presidents Trump and Zelensky, with Washington since suspending military aid and intelligence sharing to help Kyiv fight Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  This has sent Ukraine's allies scrambling, with EU leaders openly questioning Washington's reliability as a security partner going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Brussels meeting will aim to cement European support for Kyiv, it is unlikely to yield any major announcements of aid beyond the 30 billion euros (US$32 billion) the bloc has already committed for this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prospect of the United States pivoting from its European partners in Nato has fuelled a growing consensus on the summit's other major topic: the need to strengthen Europe's defences against Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has laid out a plan aimed at mobilising 800 billion euros to "re-arm Europe" – largely by freeing states to spend much more – which leaders are expected to greenlight on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Europe faces a clear and present danger on a scale that none of us has seen in our adult lifetime," she wrote to leaders, urging Europe to "act as decisively as the situation dictates."
  <br>
  <br>
  France's President Emmanuel Macron doubled down in a sombre address to the nation on the summit's eve, calling for a defence spending surge to confront a "new era" and saying he would discuss extending France's nuclear deterrent to European partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Who can believe that this Russia of today will stop at Ukraine?" Macron asked. "I want to believe that the United States will stay by our side, but we have to be prepared for that not to be the case."
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, who conferred with EU chiefs in Brussels ahead of the talks, has likewise declared himself ready for "the worst-case scenario" and embraced radical reforms to ramp up Germany's defence spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstering European defences has taken on acute urgency as Trump makes clear his desire to swiftly end the three-year war through direct negotiations with Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  His embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, while expressing contempt toward Zelensky, has cemented fears that Kyiv and Europe's interests will be overlooked in any deal to end the biggest conflict on the continent since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for a "coalition of the willing" to come together to draw up a peace plan and present it to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and other European leaders made a show of embracing Zelensky and reaffirming support for Ukraine at weekend talks in London. EU chiefs will be briefing Starmer on the Brussels talks on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  France and Britain have pitched a one-month truce "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure", though not initially on the ground. Leaders are expected to raise that proposal in Brussels, but not formally decide on it.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU leaders are also expected to start thrashing out what "security guarantees" the bloc might provide for a peace deal, including the possible deployment of European troops, which several states support.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Zelensky can expect strong words of support in Brussels, it was unclear if a deal would be reached on a new package of key weaponry, with several states arguing that Europe currently has enough money committed to meet Kyiv's needs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said on Thursday that Donald Trump's threats would encourage Israel to disregard the fragile ceasefire, after the US president said that unless hostages are freed, the people of Gaza would be "DEAD".
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's warning came hours after his administration revealed it held unprecedented direct talks with Hamas, which it proscribes as a "terrorist" group, focused on American hostages in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five Americans are believed to remain among the hostages – four have been confirmed dead and one, Edan Alexander, is believed to be alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed Israel was consulted and said in a statement that it "expressed its opinion" on the direct talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said later he was "sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job" as his administration expedites billions of dollars in weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you," he wrote on his Truth Social platform after meeting freed hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also warned of repercussions for Gaza as a whole, where virtually the entire population has been displaced by Israel's relentless military campaign in response to Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim said Trump's words pushed Israel to disregard the terms of a ceasefire in place since January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation to avoid implementing its terms," Qasim said in a statement, urging the United States to pressure Israel to enter the ceasefire's second phase. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A PhD student from China was found guilty on Wednesday in a London court of drugging and raping 10 women in China and the UK, as British police warned there could be more than 50 other victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zou Zhenhao, 28, was convicted of the attacks between 2019 and 2023 following a monthlong trial at the Inner London Crown Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  London's Metropolitan Police said Zou used online platforms and dating apps to meet women who he invited to his home under the pretext of having drinks or studying before he drugged them.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then filmed himself raping and sexually assaulting the women while they were unconscious, keeping some of their jewellery and clothing afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou was found guilty of 11 counts of rape, with two of the offences relating to one victim.
  <br>
  <br>
  After more than 19 hours of deliberations, jurors concluded Zou raped three of the women in London and seven in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutions relating to attacks in China were possible because foreign nationals who are living in the UK can be charged with an offence committed abroad that is also illegal in the country where it took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have only been able to identify two of the victims and said after the verdict that more than 50 other women may have fallen victim to Zou, which would make him one of the worst sex offenders in UK history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally from Dongguan in Guangdong Province, the mechanical engineering doctoral candidate at University College London claimed that the sexual interactions were consensual.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will be sentenced on June 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Rosina Cottage described the defendant as a “dangerous and predatory sexual offender” and that his sentence will be “very long.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou, who showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out in court, was also convicted of three counts of voyeurism, 10 of possession of an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and three of possession of a controlled drug with intent to commit a sexual offence, namely butanediol.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He has done all that he can in these offences to incapacitate his victims to the point where they could not resist his attack, and in many instances may not even remember what has occurred to them,” said Metropolitan Police Commander Kevin Southworth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are appealing to anyone who thinks they may have been targeted by Zou to contact them. (Agencies)

    Rare cyclone approaches Australian coast

<div class="itemFullText">
 Early wind and rain from a rare tropical cyclone began lashing part of eastern Australia on Thursday as schools were closed, public transport was stopped and desperate residents got around shortages of sandbags by buying potting mix.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred is forecast to cross the Queensland state coast somewhere between the Sunshine Coast region and the city of Gold Coast to the south early on Saturday, Bureau of Meteorology manager Matt Collopy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between the two tourist strips is the state capital Brisbane, Australia’s third-most populous city which will host the 2032 Olympic Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The wind impacts, we’re already seeing those start to develop on the exposed locations along our coast with gusts reaching 80-90 kph. We are expecting those to continue to develop,” Collopy told reporters in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfred is expected to become the first cyclone to cross the coast near Brisbane since Cyclone Zoe hit Gold Coast in 1974 and brought widespread flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyclones are common in Queensland’s tropical north but are rare in the state’s temperate and densely-populated southeast corner that borders New South Wales state. More than four million people lie in the cyclone’s path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfred was 280 kilometres east of Brisbane and moving west on Thursday with sustained winds near the centre of 95 kilometres per hour, and gusting to 130 kilometres per hour, Collopy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm is expected to maintain its wind strength before hitting land.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the greatest fears are for the expected flooding over a wide area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modelling shows that up to 20,000 homes in Brisbane, a city largely built on a river floodplain, could experience some level of flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said 660 schools in southern Queensland and 280 schools in northern New South Wales were closed on Thursday as weather conditions worsen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federal government had delivered 310,000 sandbags to Brisbane and more were on the way, Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A shortage of sandbags in Brisbane, a city of more than three million people, led some to buy sacks of potting mix as an alternative, according to Damien Effeney, a chief executive of a rural supplies business. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's Air Force on Thursday said one of its fighter jets had accidentally dropped eight bombs in the wrong place during a training exercise, resulting in civilians being injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Eight MK-82 general-purpose bombs were abnormally released from an Air Force KF-16 aircraft, landing outside the designated firing range," the Air Force said, adding it deeply regretted the incident "which resulted in civilian casualties".
  <br>
  <br>
  An official at Gyeonggi-do Bukbu Fire Services said out of the eight people who had been wounded, four were seriously hurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pocheon is about 40 kilometres northeast of Seoul and near the heavily militarised border with North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire officials suspected the munitions dropped on the town was from ongoing live-fire joint military exercises conducted by South Korea and the United States, the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photographs shared by news agency News1 that it said were from the scene showed a badly damaged house with rubble strewn on the ground next to it.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said earlier on Thursday that South Korea and US forces were holding their first joint live-fire exercises in Pocheon which were linked to annual military drills due to start next week. (Agencies)

    Briton jailed for 19 years for fighting for Ukraine

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain strongly condemned on Wednesday the sentencing of UK national James Anderson to 19 years in prison by a Russian court, which accused him of having fought for the Ukrainian army.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly condemn the sentencing of James Anderson, a British national, in a Russian court on false charges," said a spokesperson for the Foreign Office, who called on Russia to respect its obligations towards "prisoners of war".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian court press service for the city of Kursk said James Scott Rhys Anderson, 22, was found guilty of a "terrorist act" and acting as a mercenary, after he was captured while fighting in the region in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kursk court released video of Anderson being led into court in handcuffs, wearing a winter hat and jacket that appeared to be prison uniform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He nodded silently after having the sentence translated to him. He has the option to file an appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine launched its shock cross-border offensive in August, the first time a foreign army took control of Russian territory since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anderson, from the English town of Banbury, has spoken in several videos filmed by Russian officials after he was taken prisoner, saying that he went to fight for Ukraine's International Legion after being sacked from the British army.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kursk's second western district military court spent three days on Anderson's trial with the hearings held behind closed doors, the press service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said Anderson admitted guilt and decided to take part in the "armed conflict for financial reward".
  <br>
  <br>
  Anderson earlier told Russia's Izvestia newspaper he was paid US$400 a-month and about US$60 a day while on combat missions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton was told by the court he would spend the first five years of his sentence in a prison - where conditions are worse than in a penal colony. He would then be transferred to a penal colony with "strict" conditions. (AFP)

<img alt="Demonstrators in Jerusalem call for the immediate return of hostages held in Gaza. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794490_1_20250306090342.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued what he called a “last warning” to Hamas to release all remaining hostages held in Gaza, directing a sharply-worded message after the White House confirmed he had recently dispatched an envoy for unprecedented direct talks with the militant group.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in a statement on his Truth Social platform soon after meeting at the White House with eight former hostages, added that he was “sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,” Trump said. “Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's hawkish language came after the United States confirmed the unprecedented direct talks with Hamas, with the US envoy on hostage affairs, Adam Boehler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boehler, founder and CEO of Rubicon Founders, a healthcare investment firm, was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team during Trump’s first term that strove to win broader recognition of Israel in the Arab world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages, and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages - including Edan Alexander, an American citizen - as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha come as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains in the balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of a ceasefire ended over the weekend after six weeks of relative calm that included exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Israel has said it wants to extend the first phase until mid-April, Hamas has insisted on a transition to the second phase, which should lead to a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel has ramped up pressure, not just with threats, by halting all entry of goods and supplies into Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Britain and Germany jointly on Wednesday called the humanitarian situation in Gaza "catastrophic," and urged Israel to ensure the "unhindered" delivery of aid. (Agencies)

    Wall Street rebounds after Trump pauses auto tariffs
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt='White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US President decided to "give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA", a North American free trade pact. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794487_1_20250306084640.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks climbed on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump pulled back on some of his tariffs temporarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move revived hope on Wall Street that Trump may avoid a worst-case trade war that grinds down economies and sends inflation higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to 5,842, to bounce back from a sell-off that had erased all of its 'Trump bump' since Election Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 1.1 percent to end at 43,006, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.5 percent to 18,552.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market turned sharply higher after Trump said he was granting a one-month exemption for US automakers on his stiff new tariffs for Mexican and Canadian imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the move after talking with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the Big Three automakers could have been hurt by such tariffs because of how much production happens across the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s announcement sent relief through Wall Street, and Ford’s and General Motors’ stock both jumped more than 5 percent to help lead a widespread rally across the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worry has been that such tariffs would not only hurt profits for companies but also jack up prices for cars and other bills for US households already struggling with still-high inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A couple reports on Wednesday gave a mixed read on the US economy. One suggested US employers pulled back sharply on their hiring last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report from payrolls processing firm, ADP, could be a warning signal ahead of the more comprehensive jobs report that’s coming Friday from the US Labor Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate report said growth for US finance, real estate and other businesses in the services sector is better than economists expected. But businesses also said in the survey they’re confronting “chaos” and uncertainty because of tariffs, according to the Institute for Supply Management. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's new military chief Eyal Zamir said his country's mission to defeat Hamas remained unfinished as he took office on Wednesday, with uncertainty hanging over the fragile Gaza ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before Zamir at a ceremony at military headquarters in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was "determined" to achieve victory in the multi-front war that began with Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came after Arab leaders endorsed a plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip under the future administration of the Palestinian Authority (PA), presenting an alternative to US President Donald Trump's widely-condemned proposal to take over the territory and displace its people.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the prospect of the PA governing Gaza remains far from certain, with Israel having ruled out any future role for the body in the territory ruled by Hamas since 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has indeed suffered a severe blow, but it has not yet been defeated. The mission is not yet accomplished," Zamir said, amid a deadlock in negotiations on the next steps in the ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zamir is replacing Herzi Halevi, who announced his resignation as armed forces chief in January over the military's shortcomings on October 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military has since released the findings of an internal investigation that acknowledged its "complete failure" to prevent the deadliest attack on Israel since its creation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas assault resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, most of them civilians, while Israel's military retaliation in Gaza has killed at least 48,405 people, also mostly civilians, data from both sides show. (AFP)

    Greenlanders shrug off Trump's takeover bid

<img alt="Locals in the capital city of Nuuk are largely unfazed by President Trump's latest remarks that he would take over Greenland. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794464_1_20250306032159.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenlanders on Wednesday shrugged off US President Donald Trump's vow to take over the Arctic island, seeing it merely as an opportunity to advance their own independence bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the quiet hallways of the University of Greenland in Nuuk, the capital of the Danish autonomous territory, Trump's latest remarks that he would take over Greenland "one way or another" left locals largely unfazed, despite his more menacing tone this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me personally, it's just something ridiculous he would say, but I wouldn't take it seriously because he's basically all talk and no action," said 23-year-old law student Peter Malik Henningsen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That sounds very violent and it's also very dumb... because Denmark, and Greenland, is also an ally of America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first major policy speech on Tuesday since returning to power, Trump underlined his expansionist vision, reiterating the importance of the United States taking over the strategically-located and mineral-rich Arctic island and taking back the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  About a quarter the size of the mainland US, Greenland's location in the Arctic puts it on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Less than a week before general elections in Greenland where independence has dominated the campaign, Trump said he had a message for the island's 57,000-strong population, whom he described as "incredible people".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he then made clear he would not give up if persuasion fails, saying: "One way or the other we're going to get it," insisting the island was needed for reasons of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump offered to buy Greenland already during his first term as president - in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the Oval Office in January, he has put the topic back on the agenda, and has this time said he wouldn't rule out military force to get it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump is like that, a bit unpredictable at times but I'm not worried," said another law student, David Jensen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're part of Nato, the United States are part of Nato, so I'm not worried," insisted the 20-year-old who hails from one of the northernmost regions of Greenland. (AFP)

    US pauses intelligence sharing with Ukraine

<img alt="The Central Intelligence Agency director John Ratcliffe describes the pause as temporary. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794449_1_20250305221949.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has "paused" intelligence sharing with Ukraine after a dramatic breakdown in relations between Kyiv and the White House, CIA director John Ratcliffe said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump and Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky had a public falling-out in the Oval Office last week, followed by Ukraine's top ally suspending crucial US military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ratcliffe confirmed that intelligence sharing had also been frozen as Ukraine seeks to beat back the Russian assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump had a real question about whether President Zelensky was committed to the peace process," Ratcliffe told Fox News.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ratcliffe said the pause "on the military front and the intelligence front" was temporary, and the United States will again "work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Tuesday that Zelensky told him Kyiv was ready for talks with Moscow and the finalisation of a US minerals deal, as Ukraine works to move on after the Oval Office spat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has sought to bring Trump back onside, posting on social media that their clash was "regrettable" and he wanted "to make things right."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his address to the US Congress later on Tuesday, Trump read aloud from a letter from Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The letter reads, 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,'" Trump told US lawmakers. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Resembling a squat, wide fridge, the world's most accurate clock went on sale for US$3.3 million in Japan on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Aether clock OC 020" is so precise that it would take 10 billion years for it to deviate by one second, according to its Kyoto-based manufacturer Shimadzu Corporation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known as a "strontium optical lattice clock", it is 100 times more accurate than caesium atomic clocks, the current standard for defining seconds, the precision-equipment producer said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The machine, a box around a metre tall, is small for its kind with a volume of around 250 litres. It can also be used in research fieldwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shimadzu is aiming to sell 10 of its clocks over the next three years and hopes its customers will use them to advance scientific research in areas such as the observation of tectonic activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Optical lattice clocks have previously been installed in Tokyo's famous Skytree, the world's tallest tower, to test the general theory of relativity, which states that "time flows more slowly in places with strong gravity." (AFP)

    Rain offers hope in Japan's worst wildfire in 50 years

<img alt="The wildfire broke out on February 26, and firefighting efforts including Japan Self-Defense Forces, have continued while thousands have evacuated their homes. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794373_1_20250305144046.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wet weather looked poised to offer relief Wednesday as Japan battled its worst wildfire in half a century in a northern region hit by record-low rainfall.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blaze around the northern city of Ofunato has killed one person and forced nearly 4,000 to evacuate their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has engulfed around 2,900 hectares -- over eight times the area of New York City's Central Park -- making it Japan's largest wildfire since at least 1975, when 2,700 hectares burnt in Kushiro on Hokkaido.
  <br>
  <br>
  But rain and snow were falling Wednesday as several columns of white smoke billowed from a mountain where the blaze has been raging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Firefighters have been working on the ground through the night to extinguish the fire," a city official said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are hoping that snow, which started to fall this morning, will help," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 84 buildings are believed to have been damaged, although details are still being assessed, according to the fire agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of late Tuesday, almost 4,000 people living nearby had complied with orders to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan endured its hottest summer on record last year, as climate change pushes up temperatures worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of wildfires in the country has declined since its 1970s peak, but there were about 1,300 in 2023, concentrated in the period from February to April when the air dries out and winds pick up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese baseball prodigy Roki Sasaki, who recently joined the Los Angeles Dodgers, has offered a 10-million-yen (US$67,000) donation and 500 sets of bedding to people affected by the wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki was a high school student there, after losing his father and grandparents in the huge 2011 tsunami. (AFP)

    Democrat lawmaker ejected during Trump's speech

<div class="itemFullText">
 Democrats protested President Donald Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday with signs reading "No King!" and "Save Medicaid," with some turning their backs on the Republican as he spoke and one lawmaker marched out by security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Representative Al Green of Texas, a Democrat who plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump, loudly interrupted the speech in its first minutes by shouting that Trump did not have a mandate to cut safety net programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans are trying to pass a spending bill that could significantly slash spending on popular social programs, including the Medicaid health insurance plan for low-income people, to pay for Trump's desired tax cut plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered the sergeant-at-arms to remove Green from the chamber, and Republicans cheered as Green relented - waving his cane in the air - and was led out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green told reporters afterward, "It's worth it to let people know that there are some of us who are going to stand up against this president's desire to cut Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Republicans holding majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate, any impeachment effort against Trump is unlikely to advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around a third of the Democrats' side of the chamber had emptied as Trump's address crossed the threshold to become the longest such speech on record at an hour and 30 minutes. The rest quickly departed as Republicans gave Trump a standing ovation when the speech ended after 100 minutes, the longest in Congressional history. (Reuters)

    Trump hails 'unstoppable' America in Congress speech

<img alt="US President Donald Trump hailed his first few weeks in office, telling Congress his administration had accomplished great things for America.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump took a victory lap in a speech to Congress on Tuesday, exulting in a series of dramatic actions that have upended American foreign policy, ignited a trade war with close allies and slashed the federal workforce since he took office six weeks ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  "To my fellow citizens, America is back," Trump began to a standing ovation from fellow Republicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplish in four years or eight years -- and we are just getting started," Trump said to frequent chants from loyal lawmakers of "USA, USA!"
  <br>
  <br>
  "The American Dream is surging -- bigger and better than ever before. The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again."
  <br>
  <br>
  The primetime speech, his first to Congress since taking office on January 20, capped a second day of market turmoil after he imposed sweeping new tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump spoke in the House of Representatives, where lawmakers huddled in fear for their lives a little over four years ago while a mob of Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory over the then-incumbent Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president called his first few weeks in office "the most successful" first month of any US presidency in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also defended his tariff campaign, despite concerns that it could raise consumer prices and slow economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whatever they tariff us, we tariff them. Whatever they tax us, we tax them," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market."
  <br>
  <br>
  World leaders were watching Trump's speech closely, a day after he paused all military aid to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension followed an Oval Office blowup in which Trump angrily upbraided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in front of TV cameras.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pause in aid threatened Kyiv's efforts to defend against Russia, and further rattled European leaders worried that Trump is moving the US too far toward Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, two of the country's closest allies, and an additional 10 percent on Chinese imports deepened investor concerns about the economy.

<img alt="Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty (R) meets with Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi (L) to discuss details of the Gaza reconstruction plan, ahead of the emergency Arab summit in Cairo.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arab leaders on Tuesday endorsed Egypt's postwar plan for Gaza that would allow its roughly two million Palestinians to remain, in a counterproposal to US President Donald Trump’s plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$53 billion plan's endorsement by Arab leaders at a summit in Cairo amounted to a rejection of Trump’s proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The summit conclusions were welcomed by Hamas, rejected by Israel and given a lukewarm response by the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi expressed his appreciation for “the consensus among the Arab countries to support the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, which allows the Palestinian People to stay on their land without displacement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In a social media post after the summit, el-Sissi said he looked forward to working with Trump, other Arab nations and the international community “to adopt a plan that aims for a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian Issue, ends the root causes of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, guarantees the security and stability of the peoples of the region and establishes the Palestinian State."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House welcomed input from Arab nations, but insisted Hamas could not remain in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  “President Trump has been clear that Hamas cannot continue to govern Gaza,” White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “While the President stands by his bold vision for a post-war Gaza, he welcomes input from our Arab partners in the region. It’s clear his proposals have driven the region to come to the table rather than allow this issue to devolve into further crisis.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas welcomed the summit’s outcome, saying it marked a new phase of Arab and Islamic alignment with the Palestinian cause and that it valued Arab leaders’ rejection of attempts to transfer Palestinians from their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative US proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting. (AP)

    'China GDP could be affected by US tariffs'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Wednesday said that the latest round of US tariffs on Chinese imports could gradually reduce China's gross domestic product by some 0.3 to 0.4 percent over a 12-month period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as US President Donald Trump slapped an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese goods entering the US. That prompted Beijing to retaliate, including a tariff on US agricultural products, export restrictions on select companies and a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Xia, Chief Economist for Asia at BBVA Research, said Beijing's measures were "measured and calibrated".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that the Chinese response is very firm and shows determination to the US," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, if you look at the coverage of all these agricultural products, I think in total it's a kind of maybe around 20 percent of the total US imports, so that means the Chinese response is still measured – it leaves the room for the negotiations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also said he was not optimistic that both sides could reach a deal in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump, he's too busy, he has so many things on his agenda, like the Ukraine crisis, and imposing tariffs on other partners like Canada and Mexico,“ he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday angrily denounced Trump's "dumb" tariffs and accused the US president of seeking to collapse Canada's economy in order to annex its northern neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's US correspondent Simon Marks said there is currently a "massive" rift between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We heard Trudeau using language about the United States and its government that we have never heard in the past from any previous Canadian leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Marks said there are signs there could be a possible breakthrough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have heard from the United States commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who is a very close advisor to president Donald Trump, that there could be a climb-down coming by the US government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lutnick said there has been an enormous amount of phone conversations between Canadian and Mexican officials and the United States, according to Marks. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<img alt='In his first public comments since Trump halted US military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky said his public bust-up with Trump last week was "regrettable". Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794263_1_20250305061826.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said he wanted to "make things right" with Donald Trump and work under the US president's "strong leadership" to secure a lasting peace in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his first public comments since Trump halted US military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky said his public bust-up with Trump last week was "regrettable" and pledged to sign a key minerals deal with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for a "truce" in the sea and sky as a first step to ending the three-year war with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic collapse in the Kyiv-Washington wartime alliance has played out in the open since a televised dispute between Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office last week, mounting as Ukraine's top ally suspended crucial military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts," Zelensky wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be," the Ukrainian leader added. "It is time to make things right."
  <br>
  <br>
  He told Ukrainians in his regular evening address he had instructed his defence and intelligence chiefs to contact their US counterparts to "get official information" on the aid freeze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's stunning decision Monday to halt assistance to Ukraine deepened fears in Kyiv and many European capitals that America was pivoting away from its allies -- and towards Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow hailed Trump's decision, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling it a "solution which could really push the Kyiv regime to a peace process".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union, which -- along with Ukraine -- is excluded from US-Russian negotiations towards a potential truce, has been scrambling to bolster support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron praised Zelensky for his willingness to "re-engage in dialogue" with Trump, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Europe is fearing for the future of US-European defence cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen presented an EU plan to mobilise some 800 billion euros (US$840 billion) for Europe's defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany's likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, meanwhile said he would support the immediate approval of a three-billion-euro Ukraine aid package held up in parliament, calling it "urgent".
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU on Thursday is to hold an emergency summit aimed at cementing joint European support for Ukraine. (AFP)

    CK Hutchison to sell Panama unit after Trump pressure

<img alt="The sale to a BlackRock consortium will deliver cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion to Hong Kong's CK Hutchison. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794251_1_20250305042524.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's CK Hutchison on Tuesday agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, following intense pressure from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$22.8 billion sale, which also includes dozens of ports in other countries, appeared to be a win for Trump's aggressive diplomacy just hours before he is due to tout the successes of the first six tumultuous weeks of his second term in an address to the US Congress. Trump had refused to rule out military action to assert US control over the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has complained about the presence of mainland Chinese and Hong Kong-based companies in Panama, while US officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison's control of ports at both entrances of the canal represents a security risk for the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of licenses will result in the consortium gaining a 90 percent stake in Panama Ports Company, which has been the operator of the Balboa and Cristobal ports in the Central American country for more than two decades, CK Hutchison said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock has briefed the White House and Congressional leadership on the deal, a person familiar with the transaction said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would be BlackRock's largest infrastructure investment to date, that person said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department, White House, National Security Council and Panama's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's authorities have announced an audit of CK Hutchison's contract, saying they are investigating its compliance with concession agreements. Panama's attorney general determined earlier this month that CK Hutchison's port contract was "unconstitutional." The Supreme Court was to have had the last word on its legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made his first overseas trip as top US diplomat to Latin America last month, including to Panama, where he pressured the country over China's presence along the canal. After his departure, Rubio hailed Panama's decision to exit China's Belt and Road infrastructure plan, and he has expressed optimism in media interviews that Hutchison would not own the ports in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of Panama ports licenses held by the unit of billionaire Li Ka-shing's conglomerate to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment will give it control of an 80 percent interest in Hutchison Ports for an equity value of US$14.21 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will get control of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries while delivering cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion for the Hong Kong-based consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale does not involve any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, as well as South China, or any other ports in mainland China, CK Hutchison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consortium has agreed that negotiations will be on an exclusive basis for a period of 145 days, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock completed the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for approximately US$12.5 billion in cash and stock last October. At the time, chairman and CEO Larry Fink described infrastructure as “a generational investment opportunity.” (Reuters)

    EU chief unveils US$840 billion 'rearm' plan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday presented a five-part plan to mobilise some US$844 billion for Europe's defence, and help provide "immediate" military support for Ukraine after Washington suspended military aid.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move came hours after US President Donald Trump announced the aid freeze, intensifying Washington's push for a peace deal with Russia and confirming its pivot away from its European allies and partners in backing Kyiv's war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new era is upon us," the European Commission president said in a letter presenting the plan to EU leaders, two days before a summit aimed at cementing joint action on support for Ukraine and boosting Europe's defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Rearm Europe' could mobilise close to US$844 billion of defence expenditures for a safe and resilient Europe," von der Leyen told reporters as she outlined the plan, which includes a US$158 billion loan facility along with steps to free up large-scale defence investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear how fast funds could be made available under the proposals, which need approval by member states, nor how quickly this could translate into battlefield support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  It proposes that the EU ease strict budget rules, which oblige states to keep public deficits below three percent of gross domestic product, to allow them to ramp up spending on defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondly, the plan calls for a new "instrument" to provide US$157 billion of loans to member states for defence investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are talking about pan-European capability domains - for example, air and missile defence, artillery systems, missiles and ammunition drones and anti-drone systems," said von der Leyen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's Brussels summit, after weekend crisis talks also involving Britain and Nato, comes as Europe contemplates the prospect of the United States withdrawing longer-term support from Ukraine and more broadly from its European allies. (AFP)

    China to 'fight to the end' against US tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 China vowed on Tuesday to fight to the "bitter end" if the United States pushes a trade war, after Washington and Beijing exchanged a salvo of tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing up to 15 percent increases to import levies covering a range of American agricultural and food products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also placed 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's countermeasures are to protect its own rights and interests, Lin told a regular press conference, urging Washington to return to dialogue and cooperation as soon as possible. (Agencies)

 Canada will slap tariffs on US imports beginning on Tuesday in response to levies pledged by President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday, adding "there is no justification" for Washington's actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12.01am EST tomorrow, respond with 25 percent tariffs against US$155 billion of American goods," the Canadian prime minister said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steep US tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods came into effect Tuesday as a deadline to avert President Donald Trump's levies passed without the North American neighbours striking a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian goods will face a 25 percent tariff -- with energy resources hit by a lower 10 percent rate -- while Mexican products face a 25 percent blanket levy, according to orders Trump previously signed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a lack of progress in tackling drug trafficking as he pushed ahead with the duties. (AFP)

    US 'pauses' military aid to Ukraine

<img alt="US President Donald Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine, a White House official said, sharply escalating pressure on Kyiv to agree to peace talks with Russia. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794138_1_20250304131236.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump has paused military aid to Ukraine following his clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official said, deepening the fissure that has opened between the two one-time allies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move comes after Trump upended US policy on Ukraine and Russia upon taking office in January, adopting a more conciliatory stance towards Moscow - and after an explosive confrontation with Zelensky at the White House on Friday in which Trump criticiSed him for being insufficiently grateful for Washington's support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution," said a White House official.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House had no immediate comment on the scope and amount of aid affected or how long the pause would last.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pentagon could not provide further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment nor did the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Trump again said Zelensky should be more appreciative of American support after earlier responding angrily to an Associated Press report quoting Zelensky as saying the end of the war is "very, very far away."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer!" Trump wrote on Truth Social. (Reuters)

 Elon Musk's SpaceX called off the latest test flight of its Starship rocket just before its scheduled launch on Monday, citing an unspecified problem with the behemoth spacecraft.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Standing down from today's flight test attempt," SpaceX posted on X, also owned by Musk. "Starship team is determining the next best available opportunity to fly."
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest and most powerful rocket was set to take off with no crew at 6:45pm local time from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rescheduled launch has yet to be announced, though SpaceX employee Dan Huot said it was expected "to be about 24 hours" during a live feed of the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight will be Starship's eighth orbital mission overall and first since a dramatic mid-air explosion over the Caribbean during its last trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standing 123 metres tall, Starship is designed to eventually be fully reusable and plays a crucial role in Musk and SpaceX's vision of colonising Mars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Nasa is awaiting a modified version of the rocket for its Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Federal Aviation Administration grounded Starship after its previous flight on January 16 ended with the upper stage disintegrating in a fiery cascade over the Turks and Caicos Islands, prompting clean-up efforts for fallen debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the upcoming flight, SpaceX says it has introduced numerous upgrades to the upper-stage spacecraft, enhancing its reliability and performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission, expected to last just over an hour, includes another attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower's "chopstick" arms – a feat SpaceX has successfully executed twice, including in the last flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the first commercial mission of Europe's new heavy-lift rocket Ariane 6 was called off minutes before it was scheduled to launch, due to an "anomaly" on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest of several postponements for the rocket as Europe seeks to secure independent access to space. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new round of negotiations for an international treaty on reducing global plastics pollution will be held in Geneva in August, the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A previous round of negotiations – tasked with hammering out a legally binding treaty – ended without agreement in South Korea last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trenches, and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on the Unep website of the new talks comes in the wake of a last-ditch Cop16 finance deal on biodiversity agreed in Rome last week by delegates from some 150 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unep said the new plastics talks will be held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva from August 5 to 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  December's South Korea talks broke down following opposition from a bloc of mainly oil-producing countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from nearly 200 nations debated for a week on how to stop millions of tonnes of plastic waste from entering the environment each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks were meant to end with the world's first accord on cutting plastics pollution after nearly two years of discussions, but concluded without an agreement – except to extend talks. (AFP)
