<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Malaysia will work together on trade, the economy and investment, President Xi Jinping and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in the Malaysian capital on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a bilateral meeting, Xi said he was willing to promote development of Chinese and Malaysian relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am willing to work with you to continue to promote the development of the China-Malaysia community with a shared future in a high-level strategic direction, create more benefits for the people of the two countries, make greater contributions to regional prosperity and stability, and make the friendship between China and Malaysia from generation to generation more prosperous," the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anwar for his part said the two nations will collaborate in fields including artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only [are you the] president of a great country, the People's Republic of China, but [you are] a true friend ...We will work together in various fields of endeavour, including the economy, trade, investments, and, of course, new technology, including the AI initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  At a separate event, Xi and Anwar were present as officials from the two countries exchanged memorandums of understanding in several areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi is in Malaysia as part of a three-nation Southeast Asian trip to consolidate ties with some of the nation's closest neighbours as trade tensions with the United States escalate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Xi met with Malaysia's king, Sultan Ibrahim, in a colourful ceremony at the golden-domed Istana palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster CCTV reported that during the meeting, Xi pointed out that the two countries are good neighbours, friends and partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have frequent exchanges and are as close as one family," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This visit at your invitation is not only to fulfill our appointment a year ago to meet in Kuala Lumpur, but also to jointly work with you to usher in a new 'Golden 50 Years' in China-Malaysia relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Malaysia is the second stop of Xi's five-day, three-nation Southeast Asian tour, which began with a two-day Vietnam state visit. His next stop is Cambodia. (Reuters/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German prosecutors said on Wednesday they charged a Berlin palliative care doctor with the murder of 15 patients, alleging he acted out of a "lust" for killing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 40-year-old suspect is accused of having killed 12 women and three men between September 2021 and July 2024 using a deadly cocktail of sedatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  German press reports identify the suspect as Johannes M, but prosecutors have not released a name.
  <br>
  <br>
  The doctor allegedly "administered an anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant to his patients... without their knowledge or consent", the Berlin prosecutor's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The relaxant "paralysed the respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory arrest and death within minutes".
  <br>
  <br>
  The victims, who were all receiving care at the time, were aged between 25 and 94 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  On five occasions, prosecutors alleged that the suspect had "set fire to their apartments to cover up these killings".
  <br>
  <br>
  The list of accusations against the suspect has grown in length and severity since his initial arrest in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect was originally held on suspicion of manslaughter in relation to four deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors subsequently said in November they were treating the alleged killings as murder cases, adding four more deaths to the list of accusations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The accused appears to have had no motive for killing the people other than the act of killing itself," prosecutors said at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect had nothing other than a "lust for murder", they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said they were seeking a "lifelong professional ban" and called for the suspect to be locked in "preventative detention".
  <br>
  <br>
  A special team of investigators had identified a total of 395 suspicious cases that needed to re-examined in light of the accusations against the doctor. (AFP)

<img alt="About 10 outlets follow the US president wherever he goes, whether it is a meeting in the Oval Office or trips at home or abroad.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wire services including Reuters and Bloomberg News will no longer hold a permanent slot in the small pool of reporters who cover US President Donald Trump, the White House has said, as it moves to exert greater control over who gets to ask him questions and report on his statements in real time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decision comes after the Trump administration last week lost a court challenge brought by another wire service, the Associated Press, over its earlier exclusion from the press pool.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pool typically consists of about 10 outlets that follow the US president wherever he goes, whether it is a meeting in the Oval Office where he makes statements or answers questions, or trips at home or abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the new policy, wire services will lose their customary spot in the pool and will instead be part of a larger rotation with about 30 other newspaper and print outlets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given their mission to deliver real-time information to other news organisations and readers, wire services tend to cover the US president and the White House more closely on a daily basis than most outlets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other media customers, particularly local news organisations that have no presence in Washington, rely on the wires for up-to-date reporting, video and audio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reuters news coverage reaches billions of people each day, mostly through the thousands of news organisations around the world that subscribe to Reuters services," a Reuters spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is essential to democracy that the public have access to independent, impartial and accurate news about their government. Any steps by the US government to limit access to the president threatens that principle, both for the public and the world’s media."
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters remains committed to covering the White House in an impartial, accurate and independent way, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  And AP said the administration's actions were a grave disservice to the American people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are deeply disappointed that the administration has chosen to restrict the access of all wire services, whose fast and accurate White House coverage informs billions of people every single day, rather than reinstate The Associated Press to the wire pool," spokesperson Lauren Easton said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until the current administration, the three wire services – AP, Bloomberg and Reuters – were all standard members of the pool. But the White House barred AP in February after it refused to refer to the body of water south of the United States as the "Gulf of America" as Trump had ordered it be called. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Kingdom's top court on Wednesday upheld an appeal by a campaign group on whether transgender women are legally women under equality legislation, ruling that the law referred to a "biological woman and biological sex".
 <br>
  <br>
  The Supreme Court's judgment related to whether a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate (GRC), a formal document which gives legal recognition of someone's new gender, is protected from discrimination as a woman under Britain's Equality Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  Campaign group For Women Scotland had argued those rights should only apply based on a person's biological sex, and had challenged guidance issued by the devolved Scottish government over a 2018 law that was designed to increase the proportion of women on public sector boards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scottish ministers' guidance on that law stated that a trans woman with a full GRC was legally a woman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The terms women and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex, but we counsel against reading this judgment as a triumph for one or more groups in our society at the expense of another – it is not," Patrick Hodge, deputy president of the Supreme Court. (Reuters)

<img alt="US Vice President JD Vance spoke of the potential of a big trade deal between the US and Britain.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday said that there was a good chance the United States and Britain could strike a "great agreement" on trade due to Donald Trump's love of the country and its royal family.
 <br>
  <br>
  Britain was spared the most punitive treatment in the US president's initial tariff announcement, due to the two sides enjoying a largely balanced trade relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's UK correspondent Peter Anderson said the fact that trade was more balanced between the two countries would help in the UK's favour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His [Vance's] comments also indicated that he felt it would be easier for the US to sign a trade deal with the UK than it would be to sign one with the European countries. And he used the phrase, 'a much more reciprocal relationship with the UK.' And most people perceive that as the fact that it's quite a balanced relationship."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Anderson said the US would still push the UK to make concessions on issues such as technology and food standards, even as it held out the prospect of a trade deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government here in the UK is seen by the United States as having punitive taxes on tech firms. The so-called digital services tax here in the UK, which has been a problem for companies such as Amazon and Meta," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think the US will be pushing for a wide range of issues, but I certainly think food standards and technical and science matters will be at the fore of that."

<img alt="China is the biggest supplier of rare metals in the world. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800595_1_20250416113435.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump has ordered a probe that may result in tariffs on critical minerals, rare-earth metals and associated products such as smartphones in an escalation of his dispute with global trade partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has upended markets in recent weeks with his sweeping on-off levies, and this investigation could see him impose further tariffs if it shows that imports of critical minerals and their derivatives endanger US national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  China dominates global supply chains for rare metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without naming any other countries, the order says that the United States is dependent on foreign sources that "are at risk of serious, sustained, and long-term supply chain shocks."
  <br>
  <br>
  It states that this dependence "raises the potential for risks to national security, defense readiness, price stability, and economic prosperity and resilience."
  <br>
  <br>
  The imports targeted include so-called critical minerals like cobalt, lithium and nickel, rare-earth elements, as well as products that partly require these resources, such as electric vehicles and batteries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order states that critical minerals and their derivatives are essential for US military and energy infrastructure, noting their use in jet engines, missile guidance systems and advanced computing, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Commerce will have up to 180 days to deliver its report to Trump, the order says, adding that any recommendations for action should consider the imposition of tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a similar "national security" investigation that Trump ordered on Monday into pharmaceutical imports, and another on semiconductors and chip-making equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The process is based on a 1962 law that was seldom used before Trump, during his first 2017-2021 term, called on it to justify imposing taxes on steel and aluminium imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president again resorted to this law, known as Section 232, to reintroduce in mid-March tariffs of 25 percent on steel, aluminium and on automobiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has slapped new tariffs on friend and foe since returning to the presidency this year in a wide-ranging but often chaotic attempt to reorder the world economy by using levies to force manufacturers to relocate to the United States. (AFP)

 Joe Biden, in his first major speech since leaving the White House, railed on Tuesday against his successor US President Donald Trump's frenetic government overhaul, claiming the "hatchet" effort put Americans' retirement benefits at risk.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Fewer than 100 days, this administration has done so much damage, and so much destruction - it's kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon," the former US president told a conference of disability advocates in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration, pushing 7,000 employees out the door," said Biden, referring to the national agency which pays out retirement and disability benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wearing a blue suit and tie, and standing in front of American flags, the 82-year-old Democrat spoke for around a half-hour, displaying at times the signs of ageing that prompted him to abandon his re-election campaign last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stumbled over some sentences as he read from a teleprompter and struggled to get through winding off-the-cuff anecdotes, cutting himself off with a favourite phrase, "anyways."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in a jab at Biden, posted a short video on social media of one of the rambling anecdotes, without comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden's choice of topic, social security, aimed to ramp up pressure on Trump over his rampaging government overhaul efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted staff reductions at the agency that Trump and his billionaire aide Elon Musk have pushed as part of their Department of Government Efficiency, saying the social security "website is crashing" and hindering retirees from getting their benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  The programme, which more than 65 million Americans rely on, is colloquially known in Washington as the "third rail of politics" for its sensitivity to voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many Americans "literally count on social security to buy food, just to get by," Biden said, and "many of these beneficiaries, it's their only income. If it were cut or taken away, it would be devastating, devastating for millions of people."
  <br>
  <br>
  He bashed Trump's commerce secretary, former hedge fund manager Howard Lutnick, over a recent remark in which he said "fraudsters" would complain about a missing cheque, but not his mother-in-law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden scoffed at that characterisation, saying "what about the 94-year-old mother living all by herself - who doesn't have a billionaire in the family?" (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Worldwide consumption of wine fell in 2024 to its lowest level in more than 60 years, the main trade body said on Tuesday, raising concerns about new risks from US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) said that 2024 sales fell 3.3 percent from the previous year to 214.2 million hectolitres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The OIV, whose report was based on government figures, said this would be the lowest sales figure since 1961, when sales were 213.6 million hl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Production is also at its lowest level in more than 60 years, having fallen 4.8 percent in 2024 to 225.8 million hl.
  <br>
  <br>
  OIV statistics chief Giorgio Delgrosso said the wine industry had been hit by a perfect storm with health concerns driving down consumption in many countries while economic factors had added to troubles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Beyond the short-term economic and geopolitical disruptions," said the IOV's annual report, "it is important to consider the structural, long-term factors also contributing to the observed decline in wine consumption."
  <br>
  <br>
  The OIV said that the consumer is now paying about 30 percent more for a bottle now than in 2019-2020 and overall consumption has fallen by 12 percent since then.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, the world's top wine market, saw consumption fall 5.8 percent to 33.3 million hl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delgrosso said that tariffs ordered by US President Donald Trump, even though temporarily suspended, could become "another bomb" for the wine industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales in China remain below pre-Covid-19 levels, despite a rebound since the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe, which accounts for nearly half of worldwide sales, saw consumption fall 2.8 percent last year. Even in France, one of the key global producers, 3.6 percent less wine was knocked back last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain and Portugal were among rare markets where consumption increased.
  <br>
  <br>
  The OIV said production had been hit environmental extremes such as above average rainfall in some key regions and droughts in others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy was the world's top producer with 44 million hl, while France's output fell 23 percent to 36.1 million hl, its lowest level since 1957.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy is also the biggest wine exporter and its trade increased because of the popularity of sparkling wines such as Prosecco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain produced 31 million hl, while US wine output fell 17.2 percent to 21.1 million hl, mainly because of extreme heat. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump believes it is up to China, not the United States, to come to the negotiating table on trade, the White House said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The ball is in China's court. China needs to make a deal with us. We don't have to make a deal with them," said a statement from Trump read out by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt at a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no difference between China and any other country except they are much larger," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has slapped new tariffs on friend and foe since returning to the presidency this year, but has reserved his heaviest blows for China - imposing additional 145 percent levies on many Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took aim at Beijing again on Tuesday, saying on Truth Social that China did not fulfil its commitments under an earlier trade deal. He appeared to be referencing a pact that marked a truce in both sides' escalating tariff war during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president said China bought only "a portion of what they agreed to buy," charging that Beijing had "zero respect" for his predecessor Joe Biden's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt maintained that Trump remained open to a deal with Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed, however, that it was China that needed to step forward first, pointing to the strength of the US consumer market as leverage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of the year, Trump has imposed steep duties on imports from China, alongside a 10 percent "baseline" tariff on many US trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  His administration recently widened exemptions from these tariffs, excluding certain tech products like smartphones and laptops from the global 10 percent tariff and latest 125 percent levy on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many Chinese imports still face the total 145 percent additional tariff, or at least an earlier 20 percent levy that Trump rolled out over China's alleged role in the fentanyl supply chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Beijing has introduced counter-tariffs targeting US agricultural goods, and it later retaliated with a sweeping 125 percent levy of its own on imported US products.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has denounced the US tariffs, calling them unilateral and protectionist. (AFP)

    Hamas raises fears for Israeli-American hostage

<img alt="Hamas said on Monday it had received a new truce offer from Israel that foresees the release of 10 living hostages, starting with soldier Edan Alexander.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said on Tuesday that after an Israeli airstrike it had "lost contact" with the captors of an Israeli-American hostage in Gaza, whose release takes centre stage in Israel's latest proposal for a renewed ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited northern Gaza on Tuesday, his office announced, as the military kept up the offensive it resumed on March 18, effectively ending a two-month ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We announce that we have lost contact with the group holding soldier Edan Alexander following a direct strike on their location. We are still trying to reach them at this moment," Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's military wing the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said on his Telegram channel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military wing later released a video addressed to the families of the remaining hostages, warning them that their loved ones were likely to return in coffins if Israel keeps up its bombardment of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over video images of masked militants carrying black coffins out of white vans in the darkness, the video carried a subtitled message in English, Arabic and Hebrew.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Be prepared. Soon, your children will return in black coffins with their bodies torn apart by shrapnel from your army's missiles," the message warns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's armed wing released a video on Saturday showing Alexander alive, in which he criticised the Israeli government for failing to secure his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander appeared to be speaking under duress in the footage, making frequent hand gestures as he criticised Netanyahu's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is unclear when the video was filmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander was serving in an elite infantry unit on the Gaza border when he was abducted by Palestinian militants during their October 2023 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The soldier, who turned 21 in captivity, was born in Tel Aviv and grew up in the US state of New Jersey, returning to Israel after high school to join the army.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas said on Monday it had received a new truce offer from Israel that foresees the release of 10 living hostages, starting with Alexander, in exchange for a 45-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hamas official said the Israeli proposal called for Alexander's release on the first day of the ceasefire as a "gesture of goodwill."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was delivered to the group's delegation in Cairo by Egyptian officials over the weekend and a senior Hamas official said the group would "most likely" respond within 48 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Out of 251 hostages taken during Hamas's October 2023 attack, a total of 58 remain in captivity, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. (AFP)

<img alt="Justice minister Gerald Darmanin says the attacks remind him of those carried out by gangsters to intimidate their rivals. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800530_1_20250416015453.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's justice minister on Tuesday said gun and arson attacks on at least six prisons around the country were acts of terrorism directed at security officials charged with guarding some of the nation's most hardened crime kingpins.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visiting Toulon prison in southern France, whose entrance was shot at with an AK-47 automatic rifle, Gerald Darmanin said he could not be sure if the attacks were linked to government efforts to clamp down on France's fast-growing drug trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said authorities were making life much harder for imprisoned gangsters, and the government would not shy away from tackling drug crime, which has boosted support for the far right.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Republic will not back down," he told reporters. "These are extremely serious crimes ... an attack on the public prison service, that is, a terrorist attack."
  <br>
  <br>
  Years of record South American cocaine imports to Europe have transformed local drug markets, sparking a wave of violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite record cocaine seizures in France, gangs are reaping windfalls as they expand from traditional power bases in cities such as Marseille into smaller towns unused to drug violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darmanin, who plans to create new high-security prisons to crack down on gangsters who run their empires from behind bars, said at least six prisons had been targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prison officers' union UFAP said vehicles were set on fire outside jails in Villepinte, Nanterre, Aix-Luynes, and Valence. In Nancy, a prison officer was threatened at home, while in Marseille, there was an attempted arson attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office (PNAT) said it had taken charge of the probe into the attacks, which also targeted the National School of Prison Administration. The PNAT said officers from France's domestic intelligence agency DGSI would assist in the investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darmanin said it was unusual for PNAT, rather than specialised organised crime prosecutors, to take charge of the investigation, but it was justified due to the national scale of attacks against symbols of the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  The letters "DDPF" – apparently an acronym for "French prisoners' rights" – were tagged on many of the attack sites, and police sources suggested it could be the work of a far-left militant group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darmanin said there had been "DDPF" groups on Telegram and Signal that had encouraged attacks against prisons, but "there hasn't been any claim of responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know who's behind this slogan, and I don't care because what I remember is not that a prison door was tagged, but that it was shot at by a Kalashnikov," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darmanin said the prison attacks reminded him of contracts given to gangsters to threaten, assault or kill rivals. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday he was satisfied with talks with arch-foe the United States but warned they could ultimately prove fruitless.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tehran and Washington are due to meet again in Muscat on Saturday, a week after top officials held the highest-level talks since the landmark 2015 nuclear accord collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, who pulled out of the deal during his first term, revived his "maximum pressure" sanctions campaign after returning to office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March, he sent a letter to Khamenei urging talks and warning of possible military action if Iran refused.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's talks were "well carried out in the first steps", Khamenei said, quoted by state television. "Of course, we are very pessimistic about the other side, but we are optimistic about our own capabilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added that "the negotiations may or may not yield results."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite having no diplomatic ties since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, both sides described the talks as "constructive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran insists discussions remain "indirect" and mediated by Oman.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Trump again threatened to strike Iran's nuclear facilities if no deal was reached, calling Iranian authorities "radicals" who should not possess nuclear weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran denies seeking an atomic bomb, saying its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, especially energy production. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday began a state visit to Malaysia.
 <br>
  <br>
  He expressed hope that his trip will yield fruitful outcomes, ushering in a new "Golden 50 Years" of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi was greeted by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim when he arrived in Kuala Lumpur.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written statement upon his arrival, the president said he expects the visit to open a new historic chapter of good-neighbourly friendship and mutual benefit between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a signed article titled "May the Ship of China-Malaysia Friendship Sail Toward an Even Brighter Future" published in local media ahead of his arrival, Xi said he looks forward to meeting with Malaysian friends to celebrate the friendship between the two countries and plan for future cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also urged Beijing and Kuala Lumpur to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and strengthen cooperation on industrial and supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides must uphold the multilateral trading system, keep global industrial and supply chains stable, and maintain an international environment of openness and cooperation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added that China will work with Malaysia and other  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) member states to combat unilateralism and protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his stay in Malaysia, Xi is expected to discuss a free trade agreement between China and Asean, with Malaysia being the chair of the association this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He'll meet with King Sultan Ibrahim on Wednesday morning and Anwar later in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asean Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn said the agreement will eliminate many tariffs between China and the bloc's members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will bring more tariffs down to zero in many cases, and then expand to all the areas,” he said in an interview with CGTN.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi is on a three-nation overseas trip. He earlier visited Vietnam during which Beijing and Hanoi signed dozens of cooperation agreements.

  The president will later visit Cambodia on the final leg of his trip. (Xinhua & agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 137th edition of the China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair, kicked off on Tuesday, with the number of export exhibitors exceeding 30,000 for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  This year's edition of the fair, which ends on May 5, has attracted around 31,000 participating firms, up by nearly 900 over last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200,000 overseas buyers from 215 countries and regions have preregistered, with the lineup featuring the likes of retail giants Walmart and Target from the United States, Carrefour from France, Tesco and Kingfisher from Britain, and Germany's Metro.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair is divided into three phases: advanced manufacturing, home furnishings and products that promote a better quality of life.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will involve 172 product zones, including, for the first time, a special zone for service robots focused on showcasing the latest achievements of China's AI development efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This Canton Fair is held in the year when China's '14th Five-Year Plan' nears completion – which is of great significance in promoting the innovative development of trade, thus ensuring stable foreign trade volume and improving foreign trade quality," said Zhang Sihong, deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the large gathering of global buyers at the fair underlined the trust of the international business community in made-in-China products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair has always been an important driver of global trade, said Andre Rocha, president of the Federation of Industries of the State of Goias, Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here, people can learn about the major global development trends and cutting-edge technologies, as well as solutions that can actually boost industrial development, he added. (Xinhua)

 President Xi Jinping has described his state visit to Vietnam as "fruitful albeit brief" as he wrapped up his two-day trip on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi urged China and Vietnam to jointly oppose power politics and unilateralism.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart Luong Cuong, Xi said trade wars will undermine the international trading system, stability of the global economic order and legitimate interests of all countries in the world, especially developing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added he has full confidence in the future of bilateral relations when he bid farewell to Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Hanoi signed dozens of cooperation agreements, including on supply chains, artificial intelligence, joint maritime patrols and railway development, during the president's visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to one of the cooperation documents, the two sides agreed that China will carry out feasibility studies for two planned rail links.
  <br>
  <br>
  One connects southern Guangxi region to the Vietnamese capital Hanoi; the other involves a new line linking Shenzhen and Haiphong.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump complained about the visit, saying it was aimed at hurting the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi next heads to Malaysia on the second leg of his three-nation tour, which will also take him to Cambodia. (Xinhua & agencies)

<img alt="The general election, to be held on May 3, will be a key test for Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800466_1_20250415153003.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Singaporeans vote on May 3 in an election that will test Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's leadership, as the wealthy city-state faces a turbulent global economy upended by US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  This will be the first electoral battle for the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) under Wong since he succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding premier Lee Kuan Yew, last year after decades of leadership by the Lees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament was dissolved on Tuesday, clearing the way for the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore has long been dominated by the PAP, which is expected to remain in power, but opposition gains are closely watched as a referendum on the government's popularity.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the upcoming elections come at a precarious time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The global trading system that supported tiny, trade-reliant Singapore's rapid ascent to prosperity is under severe strain since US President Donald Trump's return to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore, one of the world's biggest transhipment hubs, finds itself exposed after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, disrupting global supply chains and sparking fears of a full-blown trade war with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Singapore's trade ministry downgraded its economic growth forecast for 2025 to between zero and 2 percent from 1 to 3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a stark warning to parliament last week, Premier Wong declared that the "era of rules-based globalisation and free trade is over".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We risk being squeezed out, marginalised and left behind," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, 52, is seeking a firm mandate to steer the country through choppy waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will "strengthen his hand and that of his government in putting in place policies and measures to protect the economy and to negotiate with other countries", said Eugene Tan, associate professor of law at the Singapore Management University.
  <br>
  <br>
  PAP is one of the world's longest-running political parties having been in power since 1959.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the party's dominance is increasingly being challenged by a more vocal electorate, especially among younger voters who appear open to alternative political voices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming elections "may well be the toughest electoral battle for the ruling party", said Mustafa Izzuddin, a political analyst with Solaris Strategies Singapore, citing the "unpredictability of ground sentiments and the emergence of a better quality opposition".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tan of SMU said "millennial and Gen-Z voters are much more receptive... to a credible opposition in parliament".
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2020, the opposition Workers' Party (WP) made historic gains, winning 10 of the 93 seats at stake – a significant jump from its previously held four seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is hoping to build on that momentum and is expected to field candidates like Harvard-trained senior counsel Harpreet Singh, 59.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 97 seats are up for grabs in this election – four more than in 2020 – following a redrawing of electoral boundaries. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese engineers began on Tuesday a difficult operation to remove a second sample of radioactive debris from inside the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 880 tonnes of hazardous material are inside the site after a catastrophic tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake triggered one of history's worst nuclear accidents in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Removing the debris is seen as the most daunting challenge in a decades-long decommissioning project because of the dangerously high radiation levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At 10.03am [9.03am Hong Kong time], the second trial extraction operation was started," Fukushima operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second removal comes after Tepco completed the first trial removal operation using a specially developed extendible device in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sample weighing just below 0.7 grams – equivalent to about one raisin – was delivered to a research lab near Tokyo for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tepco needs more data to examine methods for full-scale debris extractions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said in December it was "upgrading" the telescopic device used for the first experiment by attaching a new camera to its tip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three of Fukushima's six reactors went into meltdown in 2011 after the huge tsunami swamped the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, robots began moving sandbags that were used to absorb radiation-contaminated water on underground floors of two buildings at the Fukushima site.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, Japan began releasing into the Pacific Ocean some of the 540 Olympic swimming pools' worth of treated wastewater in a move that has been endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  China banned Japanese seafood imports as a result, and Russia later followed suit.
  <br>
  <br>
  This month China said it found no abnormalities in seawater and marine life samples that it independently collected near Fukushima in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Beijing indicated that more tests would be needed before it lifts the ban. (AFP)

<img alt="Computer monitors that contain chips such as these made-in-China models being sold at a store in Washington, DC, may come under the US investigations.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trump administration has taken its next steps towards imposing more tariffs on key imports, launching investigations into imports of computer chips, chip-making equipment and pharmaceuticals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of Commerce posted notices about the probes late on Monday on the Federal Register, seeking public comment within three weeks. It had not formally announced them earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although US President Donald Trump paused most of his biggest tariff hikes last week for 90 days, apart from those for imports from China, he has said he still plans tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Department said it is investigating how imports of computer chips, equipment to make them and products that contain them – which include many daily necessities such as cars, refrigerators, smart phones and other items – affect national security. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 permits the president to order tariffs to for the sake of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe includes assessing the potential for US domestic production of computer chips to meet US demand and the role of foreign manufacturing and assembly, testing and packaging in meeting those needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other aspects of the entire computer chip supply chain, the government intends to also study the risks of having computer chip production concentrated in other places and the impact on US competitiveness from foreign government subsidies, “foreign unfair trade practices and state-sponsored overcapacity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump said electronics would not be included in what his administration calls “reciprocal tariffs" of up to 50 percent on some nations, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explained in an interview on ABC News that pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and autos will be handled with “sector specific” tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And those are not available for negotiation,” Lutnick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They are just going to be part of making sure we reshore the core national security items that need to be made in this country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make medicine in this country. We need to make semiconductors.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation into pharmaceutical imports includes ingredients used to make such drugs and touches on many of the same aspects of relying on imports to make them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about his plans for more tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Trump said on Monday, “Yeah, we're going to be doing that.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it would be in the “not too distant future.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re doing it because we want to make our own drugs,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States is a major producer of semiconductors, but only in some areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  It relies heavily on imports from Taiwan and South Korea for certain kinds of advanced chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, Taiwan dominates advanced logic chip production at 92 percent of all fabrication capacity according to the International Trade Administration, with South Korea making 8 percent. (AFP)

<img alt="The Trump administration has been moving quickly to deport migrants such as this group of Venezuelans back to their countries of origin or any place that accepts them.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge has blocked US President Donald Trump's administration from quickly revoking the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ruling by District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston on Monday is the latest order against Trump's rapid push to carry out mass deportations, particularly targeting Latin Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March, the administration said it was moving to revoke the legal status of some 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who came to the United States under a "parole" programme initially launched by former president Joe Biden in October 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The court grants emergency relief staying the Termination of Parole Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans," Talwani wrote in her order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parole programme allowed entry to the US for two years for up to 30,000 migrants per month from the four countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her order, Talwani said the Trump administration had acted on a flawed interpretation of immigration law, with expedited removal applicable to non-citizens entering the US illegally, but not those authorised to be in the country, such as through the parole programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Trump's revocation, the immigrants would have lost their legal protection effective April 24, just 30 days after the Department of Homeland Security published its order in the Federal Register.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has vowed to deport "millions" of undocumented migrants in his second term, after running an election campaign that focused on illegal immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other measures, he has invoked rare wartime legislation to fly hundreds of alleged members of a Venezuelan gang to El Salvador, which is imprisoning the migrants. (AFP)

 Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin launched his fiancee Lauren Sanchez into space on Monday with an all-female celebrity crew that included Katy Perry and Gayle King.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest wave in space tourism, where more of the rich and famous than ever before - or lucky and well-connected - can enter the zero-gravity realm traditionally dominated by professional astronauts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New Shepard rocket blasted off on the quick up-and-down trip from West Texas. The fringes of space beckoned 107 kilometres up and provided a few precious minutes of weightlessness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, invited the others along for the 10-minute, fully automated flight, packing on the star power with singer-songwriter Perry and “CBS Mornings” co-host King.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moved by the views of Earth below, Perry said she couldn't resist singing “What a Wonderful World" in space.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also sharing the ride were film producer Kerianne Flynn; Aisha Bowe, a former NASA engineer who started her own companies to promote science education; and Amanda Nguyen, a scientist who studied planets around other stars and now advocates for survivors of sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin declined to say how much the flight cost or who paid what. The trip came two months before Sanchez and Bezos marry in Venice.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the 11th human spaceflight for the Washington state-based company, founded by Bezos in 2000 after making a fortune with Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bezos strapped in for Blue Origin’s first space tourist flight in 2021 and accompanied the latest crew to the pad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The celebrity launch was the nation’s first spaceflight where women filled each seat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only other all-female crew in 64 years of human spaceflight was back in 1963 when Soviet astronaut Valentina Tereshkova launched by herself, becoming the first woman in space. Tereshkova spent three days off the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even after the latest launch, women represent barely 15 percent of the more than 700 people who have travelled into space. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Department of Education on Monday froze more than US$2 billion in federal funding for Harvard University, just hours after the school rejected US President Donald Trump's demands that it make deep policy changes on diversity.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Department of Education task force on combating anti-semitism said in a statement that it was freezing US$2.2 billion in multi-year grants and US$60 million in multi-year contract value to Harvard University.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move marks a new level of contentiousness between the Trump administration and American universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for numerous universities, pressing the institutions to make policy and other changes and citing what it says is a failure to fight anti-semitism on campus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deportation proceedings have begun against some detained foreign students who took part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, while visas for hundreds of other students have been cancelled. The crackdown has raised concerns about speech and academic freedoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard on Monday rejected Trump administration demands that to receive federal funding it end diversity efforts and take other steps that the university said would stifle intellectual freedoms of faculty and students. (Reuters)

<img alt="US authorities are investigating the national security effects of imports of pharmaceuticals and ingredients, as well as semiconductors and chip-making equipment.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has opened the door to potential tariffs targeting pharmaceuticals and semiconductor imports, according to government filings on Monday, shortly after US President Donald Trump warned recent tech exclusions would only be temporary.
 <br>
  <br>
  The commerce secretary has initiated a pair of investigations into the national security effects of imports of pharmaceuticals and ingredients, as well as semiconductors and chip-making equipment, according to filings to the Federal Register.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probes were launched under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, according to the filings, and this was the same legal mechanism that Trump previously used to impose other sector-specific duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has unleashed sweeping tariffs on US trading partners - hitting imports from China with especially stiff rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has also imposed a series of sector-specific levies, recently slapping tariffs on imports of steel, aluminium and autos.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Department's latest filings call for public comment on pharma and semiconductors imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  This includes the impact of current trade policies on domestic semiconductor production and capacity, and whether additional measures like tariffs or quotas might be "necessary to protect national security." (AFP)

<img alt="Vice-President of the European Commission Kaja Kallas (L) shakes hands with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa following their meeting in Ramallah. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800386_1_20250415074047.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union on Monday announced a new three-year financial support package for the Palestinians worth US$1.8 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fresh aid pledge came as EU foreign ministers met Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa in Luxembourg for the first meeting of "high-level dialogue" between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are stepping up our support to the Palestinian people. 1.6 billion euros until 2027 will help stabilise the West Bank and Gaza," EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU is looking to boost the Palestinian Authority as Israel has resumed its war in Gaza after a ceasefire largely put a halt to the fighting for two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will reinforce the authority's ability to meet the needs of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and prepare it to return to govern Gaza once conditions allow," Kallas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU foreign policy chief reiterated the bloc's condemnation over the "total blockade of aid into Gaza" and insistence that there was no military solution to the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mustafa said the international community faced a "moment of truth" over the situation in Gaza and the West Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We came to demand clarity from the international community," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels - the biggest international donor to the Palestinians - said the package would include 620 million euros in grants for the Palestinian Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The funds will be linked to reforms on "fiscal sustainability, democratic governance, private sector development and public infrastructure and services", the EU said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest will be made up of 576 million euros in grants for projects aimed at helping economic recovery in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
  <br>
  <br>
  A further 400 million euros in loans would come from the bloc's lending arm, the European Investment Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's new package follows on from the previous three-year support plan worth 1.36 billion euros from 2021 to 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite being a major provider of aid, the EU has struggled to exert influence in the crisis as its 27 countries clash frequently over their approach to the conflict. (AFP)

<img alt="US President Donald Trump meets with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office at the White House.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Monday hosted El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, who is now the US leader's key ally in a controversial push to deport illegal migrants to a notorious Salvadoran prison.
 <br>
  <br>
  The meeting comes as the White House faces pressure over the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a father who was mistakenly deported to the jail in the Central American country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A federal judge ordered the government to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, but Trump officials contend he is now solely in Salvadoran custody, leaving the man in legal limbo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukele addressed the issue in his meeting with Trump, saying he would not return Abrego Garcia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How can I return him to the United States? It's like, I smuggle him into the United States?...I don't have the power to return him to the United States," Bukele said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukele, known for his stylish dress sense and social media savvy, is broadly popular at home for clamping down on once rampant drug gangs that terrorised El Salvador.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 43-year-old Salvadoran leader is accused of overseeing mass human rights violations, epitomised by a huge, brutal prison known as CECOT.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after Trump's inauguration for a second term, Bukele made the extraordinary offer to take in prisoners from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took the Salvadoran leader up on his proposal, sending more than 250 migrants there after invoking a rarely used wartime law dating to 1798, which stripped the deportees of due process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slickly produced footage of their arrival - including chained and tattooed men having their heads shaved and being frog-marched by masked guards - was widely promoted by both the Salvadoran and US governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration contends that the migrants are members of criminal gangs designated by the United States as terrorist organisations, including El Salvador's MS-13 and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, relatives of several of the men contend they have no connection to organised crime and in some cases had been swept up simply because they had tattoos unrelated to any gang activity. (AFP)

<img alt="Abdullah Badawi was prime minister of Malaysia from 2003 to 2009.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Malaysian prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi died on Monday, aged 85, his family and medical authorities reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  Abdullah became Malaysia's fifth prime minister in 2003, following the resignation of veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad after 22 years at the helm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former premier died at 7.10pm at the National Heart Institute in the capital Kuala Lumpur, his son-in-law and former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin said in an Instagram post, without specifying a cause of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdullah was admitted to the National Heart Institute on Sunday after experiencing breathing difficulties and was immediately placed under intensive care, the institute said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite all medical efforts, he passed away peacefully, surrounded by his loved ones," the institute said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As premier of the Muslim-majority country, Abdullah embarked on an anti-corruption drive and espoused a moderate version of Islam that aimed for economic and technological progress over religious fundamentalism.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he came under public criticism for his review of fuel subsidies that saw a sharp spike in prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdullah stepped down in 2009, a year after an election that saw the then-ruling Barisan Nasional coalition lose its parliamentary supermajority for the first time in the country's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was succeeded by Najib Razak. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Vietnam on Monday signed dozens of cooperation agreements, strengthening ties between the two countries after President Xi Jinping warned that protectionism leads nowhere and that a trade war would have no winners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi is in Vietnam for the first leg of a Southeast Asia tour, as Beijing tries to present itself as a stable alternative to an erratic US President Donald Trump, who announced – and then mostly reversed – sweeping tariffs this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi was welcomed to Hanoi with a 21-cannon salute, a guard of honour and rows of flag-waving children at the presidential palace, before holding talks with Vietnam's top leaders including General Secretary To Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two neighbours signed 45 cooperation agreements, including on supply chains, AI, joint maritime patrols and railway development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit comes almost two weeks after the United States – manufacturing powerhouse Vietnam's biggest export market in the first three months of the year – slapped a 46 percent levy on Vietnamese goods as part of a global trade blitz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and most other countries have been paused, China still faces enormous levies and is seeking to tighten regional trade ties and offset their impact during Xi's first overseas trip of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will depart Vietnam on Tuesday, travelling onwards to Malaysia and Cambodia on a tour that "bears major importance" for the broader region, Beijing has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking during a meeting with Lam, Xi said Vietnam and China were "standing at the turning point of history... and should move forward with joint hands".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi earlier urged the two countries to "resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reiterated Beijing's line that a "trade war and tariff war will produce no winner, and protectionism will lead nowhere" in an article published on Monday in Vietnam's major state-run Nhan Dan newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vietnam's Lam said in an article posted on the government's news portal on Monday that his country "is always ready to join hands with China to make cooperation between the two countries more substantive, profound, balanced and sustainable". (AFP)

 Pop star Katy Perry will be the biggest name in an all-woman group set to touch the edge of space on Monday, roaring into the cosmos on one of billionaire Jeff Bezos' rockets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Firework" and "California Gurls" singer will be lofted more than 100 kilometers above the Earth's surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other women including Bezos' fiancee Lauren Sanchez will join the flight, slated to blast off from western Texas at around 9.30 pm Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their fully automated craft will rise vertically before the crew capsule detaches mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's mission is the first all-woman space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line, the internationally recognized boundary of space.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part "for my daughter Daisy," whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, "to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space'," Perry added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in a separate video posted to Instagram that she was shocked to discover during space training that the capsule she will travel in was named the "Tortoise" and decorated with a "feather" design -- the two nicknames her parents have for her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no coincidences and I'm just so grateful for these confirmations and so grateful that I feel like something bigger than me is steering the ship," Perry said in the video. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping arrived in Hanoi on Monday to start a state visit to Vietnam.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written statement upon his arrival at the Noi Bai International Airport, Xi said he was very pleased to start his fourth state visit to Vietnam at the invitation of General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee To Lam and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that this year marks the 95th anniversary of the founding of the CPV, the 80th anniversary of the founding of Vietnam and the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the South, Xi said the CPV has united and led the Vietnamese people in steadfast pursuit of realising the two goals set for the centenary of the party and the country respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added that the Chinese side is pleased to see that living standards in Vietnam have steadily improved, Vietnam's global and regional influence has continued to grow, and the country has made notable progress in advancing its socialist industrialisation and modernisation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi expressed his belief that under the strong leadership of the CPV Central Committee, Vietnam will surely pursue the socialist path suited to its national conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the Foreign Ministry said the president called for stronger cooperation with Vietnam in industrial and supply chains and wider collaboration in emerging fields.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also visit Malaysia and Cambodia on his current overseas trip. (Xinhua & agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World leaders condemned the latest Russian missile strike on Ukraine, one of the deadliest attacks in months, while US President Donald Trump called it a "horrible thing" and a "mistake".
 <br>
  <br>
  Two ballistic Iskander-M/KN-23 missiles hit the centre of the northeastern city of Sumy, close to the Russian border, on Sunday morning, killing at least 34 people and wounding more than 100 others, Ukrainian authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian attack damaged 20 buildings in total, including a university, five apartment buildings, cafes, shops and the district court, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike came two days after US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and push Trump's efforts to end the more than three-year war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it was terrible. And I was told they made a mistake. But I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing," US President Trump said on board Air Force One while headed back to Washington on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked to clarify what he meant by a "mistake", Trump said that "they made a mistake... you're gonna ask them" – without specifying who or what he was referring to.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the attack "horrifying" and a "tragic reminder of why President Trump and his administration are putting so much time and effort into trying to end this war and achieve durable peace".
  <br>
  <br>
  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was "deeply alarmed and shocked" by the strike, which highlighted a "devastating pattern of similar assaults on Ukrainian cities and towns in recent weeks", his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's President Emmanuel Macron said the strike showed Russia's "blatant disregard for human lives, international law and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump".
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was "appalled" by the attack, which Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni described as a "cowardly" act by Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany's chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz described it as "a serious war crime, deliberate and intended". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Incumbent President Daniel Noboa claimed a runaway victory in Ecuador's presidential election, after voters endorsed the young leader's "iron fist" approach to rampant cartel violence.
 <br>
  <br>
  With over 90 percent of the votes counted, the National Election Council said Noboa had an unassailable 12-point lead over his leftist rival Luisa Gonzalez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official results showed Noboa with 56 percent of the vote, against Gonzalez's 44 percent – a far bigger winning margin than expected after a virtual tie in the first round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to jubilant supporters in his hometown of Olon, the 37-year-old president claimed a "historic victory".
  <br>
  <br>
  "A huge hug to all those Ecuadorians who always believed in this young president!" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ecuadorians have spoken, from tomorrow morning we will go to work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gonzalez – seemingly shocked by her weak showing and perhaps the end of her dream of becoming Ecuador's first woman president – immediately questioned the results.
  <br>
  <br>
  She accused Noboa of "the most grotesque electoral fraud" and called for a recount of the ballots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I refuse to believe that the people prefer lies over the truth," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She did not immediately provide evidence for her claims of fraud. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Aviation Administration said the helicopter company involved in the Hudson River crash in New York City on Thursday that killed all six people on board including three children was shutting down operations immediately.
 <br>
  <br>
  The chopper run by New York Helicopter Tours also lacked flight recorders, the National Transportation Safety Board also said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No video or camera recorders have been recovered from the Bell 206 helicopter, the NTSB said, and none of the equipment on it had recorded information that would help the investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Divers from the NYPD were continuing to search for parts of the helicopter, including the main rotor, gearbox, tail rotor and the tail boom, the safety agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said it was "analyzing airplane/helicopter hotspots nationwide" and it would hold a helicopter safety panel meeting on April 22 to discuss the findings.
  <br>
  <br>
  New York Helicopter Tours said on its website it was referring all requests for comment to the FAA and NTSB.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aircraft, whose passengers included a senior executive of Siemens AG, his wife and three children, had its last major inspection done on March 1, and had completed seven tour flights before the crash, according to federal investigators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Divers recovered the victims' remains as well as the pilot from the submerged helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four people were declared dead at the scene, while the remaining two died later after they were transported to nearby hospitals. (Reuters)

    Nobel literature laureate Vargas Llosa passes away

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, who enchanted readers with his intellectual rigor and lyrical prose for five decades and came close to being president of his country, has died aged 89.
 <br>
  <br>
  He passed away in the country's capital Lima surrounded by his family and "at peace," his son Alvaro Vargas Llosa, a well-known political commentator, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A leading light in the 20th century Latin American literature boom, Vargas Llosa won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2010 for works like "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter," "Death in the Andes," and "The War of the End of the World."
  <br>
  <br>
  But early on he abandoned the socialist ideas that were embraced by many of his peers, and his dabbling in politics and conservative views annoyed much of Latin America's leftist intellectual class.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1990, he ran for president of Peru, saying he wanted to save his country from economic chaos and a Marxist insurgency.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lost in the run-off to Alberto Fujimori, a then-unknown agronomist and university professor who defeated the insurgents but was later jailed for human rights crimes and corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frustrated by his loss, the writer moved to Spain but remained influential in Latin America, where he harshly criticized a new wave of strident leftist leaders led by then-Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his dozens of novels, plays and essays, Vargas Llosa told stories from various viewpoints and experimented with form -moving back and forth in time and switching narrators.
  <br>
  <br>
  His work crossed genres and established him as a foundational figure in a generation of writers that led a resurgence in Latin American literature in the 1960s.
  <br>
  <br>
  His books often examined the unnerving relationships between leaders and their subjects. "The Feast of the Goat" (2000) details the brutal regime of Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo, while "The War of the End of the World" (1981) tells the true story of a fanatical preacher whose flock dies in a deadly war with Brazil's army in the 1890s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born to middle-class parents in Arequipa, Peru, on March 28, 1936, Vargas Llosa lived in Bolivia and the Peruvian capital Lima. He later made a home in Madrid, but retained influence in Peru, where he wrote for newspapers about current events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vargas Llosa frequently drew from personal experience and his family, at times inserting characters based on his own life into his tales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 1970s, Vargas Llosa, a one-time supporter of the Cuban revolution, denounced Fidel Castro, maddening many of his leftist literary colleagues like Colombian writer and fellow Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1976, the two had a famous argument, throwing punches outside a theater in Mexico City. A friend of Garcia Marquez said Vargas Llosa was upset that the Colombian had consoled his wife during an estrangement but Vargas Llosa refused to discuss it. (Reuters)

    Israel intensifies strikes across Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A wave of Israeli strikes across Gaza on Sunday hit a hospital and other sites, killing at least 21 people, including children, as Israel vowed to expand its security presence in the small coastal strip.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pre-dawn strike on Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was the latest of several attacks on northern Gaza's last major hospital providing critical health care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital director Dr Fadel Naim said the emergency room, pharmacy and surrounding buildings were severely damaged, affecting over 100 patients and dozens of staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  One patient, a girl, died during the evacuation following an Israeli warning because staff were unable to provide urgent care, Gaza's Health Ministry said. Israel said it struck a Hamas command and control centre at the hospital. Hamas denied the allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al-Ahli Hospital is run by the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which condemned the attack, saying in a statement it happened on “Palm Sunday, the start of the Holy Week, the most sacred week of the Christian year.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Palm Sunday commemorates Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem, and worshippers in Gaza City marked it in a church whose gilded trim and intact walls were a contrast to the widespread debris elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours later Sunday, a strike on a car in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed at least seven people including six brothers, according to staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. The youngest brother was 10.

 President Xi Jinping called for stronger cooperation with Vietnam in industrial and supply chains and wider collaboration in emerging fields, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi starts a three-nation tour of Southeast Asia this week, beginning his state visits with Vietnam from April 14 to 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also urged strengthening coordination and cooperation through regional initiatives such as the East Asia Cooperation and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, the ministry said, citing an article by the president published in Vietnam media.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called such efforts necessary to "inject more stability and positive energy into a chaotic and intertwined world".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism has no way out," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, maintain the stability of the global industrial and supply chains, and maintain the international environment for open cooperation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Xi said China welcomes more high-quality imports from Vietnam and encourages more Chinese enterprises to invest and start businesses in the Southeast Asian country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries should expand cooperation in emerging fields such as 5G, artificial intelligence and green development, the article said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit, planned for weeks, comes as Beijing faces 145 percent US duties, while Vietnam is negotiating a reduction of threatened US tariffs of 46 percent that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will visit Malaysia and Cambodia from April 15 to 18. He last visited Cambodia and Malaysia nine and 12 years ago, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's trip to Hanoi is his second in less than 18 months. The two are set to sign about 40 agreements in multiple sectors, Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Bui Thanh Son said on Saturday, noting Hanoi wanted to boost cooperation on railways, agricultural trade and the digital and green economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing is also seeking Vietnam's approval for its COMAC planes. (Agencies)

    Pennsylvania governor's residence set on fire

 A 38-year-old man was in custody and will face attempted homicide and aggravated arson charges after setting a fire overnight at Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence, state authorities said at a press conference at the governor's mansion in Harrisburg on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, identified as Cody Balmer from Harrisburg, whose motive is still unknown, slipped over a fence around the property carrying homemade incendiary devices and evaded state troopers long enough to enter the residence, set it on fire and leave, said Pennsylvania police officials. He was apprehended shortly before the press conference on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  State police banged on the bedroom doors of Shapiro and his family around 2 am to evacuate them as local firefighters extinguished the blaze. No one was injured, although burn marks could be seen on parts of the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shapiro, a Democrat seen as a potential candidate for his party's presidential nomination in 2028, said at the press conference that FBI Director Kash Patel had spoken to him a few hours earlier and promised "all the resources of the federal government" in investigating the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The residence was set on fire hours after Shapiro posted a picture of his family's "seder" table as they celebrated the first night of the Jewish holiday of Passover, which is about going "from slavery into freedom," according to Shapiro.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempts to put on me by attacking us as they did here last night," he said on Sunday, vowing to continue his work for Pennsylvania without fear. Shapiro added that his family still planned to hold a second seder on Sunday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether the attack could have been a hate-motivated crime, Shapiro said he would defer to the findings from federal authorities and Pennsylvania's district attorney.
  <br>
  <br>
  A "multifaceted review in terms of security measures and the exact timeline of how it happened" will be carried out, said Lieutenant Christopher Paris, commissioner of the Pennsylvania state police. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump is in "excellent health," a White House doctor's assessment said on Sunday, after he underwent his first annual medical checkup since returning to the US presidency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump, 78, has repeatedly boasted about his own vigour since starting a second term, while mocking his 82-year-old Democratic predecessor Joe Biden as decrepit and mentally unfit for office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State," read a physician's letter shared by the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted only a few abnormalities that included minor sun damage to Trump's skin, as well as scarring on his right ear from a gunshot wound after he was shot at in an assassination attempt last July.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire had told reporters on Friday he felt "in very good shape" after his exam earlier that day at the Walter Reed military hospital in the Washington suburbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has been accused of a lack of openness about his health despite huge interest in the well-being of America's commander-in-chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said previously that presidential physician Sean Barbabella would give a readout of the physical and that "of course" it would provide the full report. (AFP)

    Russian strike on Ukraine's Sumy kills at least 34

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Russian strike on Ukraine's northeastern city of Sumy killed at least 34 people, including two children, and wounded dozens on Sunday, Kyiv said, in the deadliest attack in months.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine said Russia launched ballistic missiles on Sumy's city centre on Palm Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came two days after US envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Russia to meet its leader, Vladimir Putin and despite US President Donald Trump urging Moscow to end the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sumy lies close to the Russian border and has come under increasing attack in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses reported seeing bodies covered in silver sheets strewn across the centre of the city, as well as a severely destroyed trolleybus, and rescuers working through the rubble of a building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers said the strike hit the city centre "right when there were many people on the street."
  <br>
  <br>
  They said people were wounded or killed "in the middle of the street, in cars, public transport, and in houses."
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the second Russian attack with a large civilian death toll this month as Trump voices some anger at Moscow for "bombing like crazy" in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky called on the world to put pressure on Russia to end the three-year war and called for a "strong response" from Europe and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Talking has never stopped ballistic missiles and bombs," Zelensky said, two days after Witkoff held hours-long talks with Putin in Saint Petersburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Enemy missiles hit an ordinary city street, an ordinary life: houses, educational institutions, cars on the street," he said on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has not yet commented on the strike. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States wants a nuclear agreement "as soon as possible", Iran said after rare talks on Saturday, as US President Donald Trump threatens military action if they fail to reach a deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who briefly spoke face-to-face with Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff during the indirect meeting in Oman, said the talks would resume next Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The American side also said that a positive agreement was one that can be reached as soon as possible but that will not be easy and will require a willingness on both sides," Araghchi told Iranian state television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At today's meeting, I think we came very close to a basis for negotiation... Neither we nor the other party want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions' sake, time wasting or talks that drag on for ever," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the White House said: "The discussions were very positive and constructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oman's foreign minister acted as intermediary in the talks in Muscat, Iran said. The Americans had called for the meetings to be face-to-face.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the negotiators also spoke directly for "a few minutes", Iran's foreign ministry said. It said the talks were held "in a constructive and mutually respectful atmosphere".
  <br>
  <br>
  The long-term adversaries, who have not had diplomatic relations for more than 40 years, are seeking a new nuclear deal after Trump pulled out of an earlier agreement during his first term in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Araghchi, a seasoned diplomat and key architect of the 2015 accord, and Witkoff, a real estate magnate, led the delegations in the highest-level Iran-US nuclear talks since the previous accord's collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two parties were in "separate halls" and "conveying their views and positions to each other through the Omani foreign minister", Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The process took place in a "friendly atmosphere", Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, weakened by Israel's pummelling of its allies Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, is seeking relief from wide-ranging sanctions hobbling its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran has agreed to the meetings despite baulking at Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign of ramping up sanctions and repeated military threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile the United States, hand-in-glove with Iran's arch-enemy Israel, wants to stop Tehran from ever getting close to developing a nuclear bomb.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no visible signs of the high-level meeting at a luxury hotel in Muscat, the same venue where the 2015 agreement was struck when Barack Obama was US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal earlier that the US position starts with demanding that Iran completely dismantle its nuclear programme -- a view held by hardliners around Trump that few expect Iran to accept.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries," Witkoff told the newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponisation of your nuclear capability," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks were revealed in a surprise announcement by Trump during a White House appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours before the talks began, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: "I want Iran to be a wonderful, great, happy country. But they can't have a nuclear weapon."
  <br>
  <br>
  Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's adviser Ali Shamkhani said Iran sought "a real and fair agreement".
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's meetings followed repeated threats of military action by both the United States and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it requires military, we're going to have military," Trump said Wednesday when asked what would happen if the talks fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2015 deal that Trump abandoned aimed to make it practically impossible for Iran to build an atomic weapon, while at the same time allowing it to pursue a civil nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, which insists its nuclear programme is only for civilian purposes, stepped up its activities after Trump withdrew from the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest International Atomic Energy Agency report said Iran had an estimated 274.8 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 percent, nearing the weapons grade of 90 percent. (AFP)

 The United States and Iran opened high-stakes talks on Tehran's nuclear programme on Saturday, with President Donald Trump threatening military action if they fail to produce a deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides entered "indirect" talks -- via an intermediary -- in the Omani capital Muscat, Iran's foreign ministry said. The Americans had called for the meetings to be face-to-face.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disagreement over the format indicated the task facing the long-term adversaries, who are seeking a new nuclear deal after Trump pulled out of an earlier agreement during his first term in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was leading the Iranian delegation while Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff headed the US team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our intention is to reach a fair and honourable agreement from an equal position," Araghchi said in a video posted by Iranian state TV.

 At least 69 people were killed this week in unusually intense thunderstorms across eastern India's Bihar state and in neighbouring Nepal, officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bihar disaster authorities said at least 61 people had died in strong thunder and lightning storms on Thursday and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight more people were killed in neighbouring Nepal, disaster officials said, blaming "lightning strikes" on Wednesday and Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy rain was forecast to hit Bihar again on Saturday, according to the local India Meteorological Department office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, experts warned that climate change was fuelling an alarming increase in deadly lightning strikes in India, killing nearly 1,900 people a year in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lightning caused 101,309 deaths between 1967 and 2020, with a sharp increase between 2010 and 2020, a team of researchers led by Fakir Mohan University in the eastern state of Odisha said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A man facing the death penalty for committing two murders was executed by firing squad on Friday, the second such execution in the US state of South Carolina this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikal Mahdi, 42, was executed for the 2004 murder of 56-year-old James Myers, an off-duty police officer, and the murder of a convenience store employee three days earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement from the prison, "the execution was performed by a three-person firing squad at 6:01 pm (2201 GMT)," with Mahdi pronounced dead four minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tonight, the state of South Carolina executed him by firing squad -- a horrifying act that belongs in the darkest chapters of history, not in a civilized society," defence lawyer David Weiss said in a statement. "Mikal died in full view of a system that failed him at every turn -- from childhood to his final breath."
  <br>
  <br>
  Myers found Mahdi hiding in a garden shed at his home before Mahdi killed him and set the body on fire. Mahdi also pleaded guilty to murdering a convenience store clerk three days before he killed Myers.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Carolina gives its death row inmates a choice between lethal injection, the electric chair and the firing squad. Mahdi chose the firing squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first execution by firing squad in the United States in 15 years was carried out in South Carolina on March 7, when a man convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend's parents was put to death.
  <br>
  <br>
  A three-person squad of Department of Corrections volunteers opens fire on the condemned man, who is restrained in a chair with a hood over his head 15 feet (five meters) away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi had requested clemency from Governor Henry McMaster but South Carolina's Republican chief executive did not grant it, or any previous clemency petitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi's lawyers had argued that he had suffered his entire life. He was four when his mother fled her abusive husband, leaving the boy to be raised by his volatile mentally ill father, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Between the ages of 14 and 21, Mikal spent over 80 percent of his life in prison and lived through 8,000 hours in solitary confinement," his lawyers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They described Mahdi as "deeply remorseful and a dramatically different person from the confused, angry and abused youth who committed the capital crimes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi's execution was the 12th in the United States this year. There were 25 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of US executions since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 have been performed using lethal injection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alabama has carried out four executions using nitrogen gas, a method that has been denounced by United Nations experts as cruel and inhumane.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while three others -- California, Oregon and Pennsylvania -- have moratoriums in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump is a proponent of capital punishment and on his first day in office called for an expansion of its use "for the vilest crimes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Attorney General Pam Bondi announced last week that federal prosecutors would seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, charged with the high-profile December 4 murder in New York of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. (AFP)

<img alt="Colonel Susannah Meyers was removed after reports she distanced herself from comments made by US Vice President JD Vance.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the US military base in Greenland, a Danish territory coveted by US President Donald Trump, has been fired for criticising Washington's agenda for the Arctic island.
 <br>
  <br>
  Colonel Susannah Meyers, who had served as commander of the Pituffik Space Base since July, was removed after reports she distanced herself and the base from US Vice President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark and its oversight of the territory during his visit two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties," the US Space Force said in a statement late Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement did not expand further, but US website Military.com said Meyers sent a March 31 email to all personnel at Pituffik "seemingly aimed at generating unity among the airmen and guardians, as well as the Canadians, Danes and Greenlanders who work there" following Vance's appearance."
  <br>
  <br>
  During his March 28 visit to the base, Vance told a press conference, "Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Nuuk and Copenhagen viewed the visit as a provocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on social media, "We are open to criticisms, but let me be completely honest, we do not appreciate the tone in which it's being delivered."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Greenland's new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a Facebook post that "the United States will not get Greenland. We don't belong to anyone else. We decide our own future."
  <br>
  <br>
  In her email, relayed to Military.com, Meyers wrote, "I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base."
  <br>
  <br>
  On X, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said, "Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meyers has been replaced by Colonel Shawn Lee, the US Space Force said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has insisted that Washington needs control of Greenland for national and international security and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it, causing tensions to soar between the United States and Denmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen traveled to Greenland last week, telling the United States that "you cannot annex another country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls show a vast majority of Greenland's 57,000 people want to become independent from Denmark but do not wish to become part of the United States. (AFP)

    Trump takes annual physical exam, says it went well

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump, who in January became the oldest person to assume the US presidency, underwent his first physical exam of his second term on Friday and said it went well, with results set to be released Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who turns 79 in June and likes fast food so much he staged a photo op at a McDonald's during his campaign last year, spent several hours being poked and prodded by the doctors at Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went, I think, well ... every test you can imagine, I was there for a long time, the yearly physical," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. "I think I did well. I think they're releasing the report on Sunday," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he took a cognitive exam and got all the answers right.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall I felt I was in very good shape. A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul and I took — I wanted to be a little different than Biden. I took a cognitive test and I don't know what to tell you other than I got every answer right," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The physical could offer the first clear look at Trump's condition since his ear was grazed by a bullet in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July.
  <br>
  <br>
  His campaign released a report by Ronny Jackson, Trump's former White House doctor and a Republican Congressman from Texas, saying the injuries were superficial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House typically determines what data will be released from a president's health exam and earlier in the day Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said results will be released as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is not compelled to release any information, and there is no template for the presidential exam. Trump released only limited information about his health during his presidential campaigns.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 2024 election, Trump drew sharp contrasts with his predecessor, Joe Biden, now 82, claiming he was younger and fitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House doctor in 2018, when Trump was serving his first term, said the president was in overall excellent health but needed to shed weight and start a daily exercise routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked on Friday if the medical team had suggested any changes to his habits, the president said that they had "a little bit", but did not elaborate further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump included a cognitive exam, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, as part of his physical during his first term, and his doctor later said he scored 30 out of 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden released detailed summaries of his physical exams while in office, but several books published in recent months have raised questions about his mental acuity in his final months in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mental ability and age of both Biden and Trump were in focus during last year's election campaign, especially after Biden's disastrous performance in a debate with Trump in June, and Trump's increasingly rambling speeches at rallies. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of Israeli air strikes on Gaza have killed "only women and children" after a ceasefire collapsed, the UN said, as an Israeli attack in the territory's south on Friday left a family of 10 dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  A UN rights office report also warned that expanding Israeli evacuation orders were resulting in the "forcible transfer" of people into ever-shrinking areas, raising "real concern as to the future viability of Palestinians as a group in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said it was looking into the attack that killed members of the same family in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, adding separately that it had struck about 40 "terror targets" across the territory over the past day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed its Gaza strikes on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, more than 1,500 people have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory to which Israel cut off aid more than a month ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten people, including seven children, were brought to the hospital as martyrs following an Israeli air strike that targeted the Farra family home in central Khan Yunis," civil defence spokesperson Mahmud Bassal said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced Israel, saying: "If this is not barbarism, I ask you, what is it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  And the UN decried the impact of the ongoing Israeli strikes, finding that "a large percentage of fatalities are children and women". (AFP)

 A subway tunnel under construction near Seoul collapsed on Friday, likely leaving two workers trapped at the site, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Fire Agency said authorities were mobilising 55 rescue workers and 18 vehicles to rescue possible victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The collapse happened at Gwangmyeong, a city just south of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's officials said authorities earlier withdrew workers from the construction site and stopped traffic around the area after receiving reports that a ventilation shaft at the site was at a risk of collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officials said it wasn't immediately known whether any workers re-entered the site. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top EU officials and Chinese leaders are due to hold their next summit marking 50 years of ties in China in July, a spokesperson for the European Council said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The European Union had announced plans for a summit in January, before US President Donald Trump took office and unleashed swingeing tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are coordinating with China to set a date for the meeting, which is expected to take place in China in the second half of July," said the official at the council, the body representing the EU's 27 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bloc faces a delicate balancing act, seeking to negotiate with an unpredictable ally in Washington to avoid tariffs and the need to diversify trading partners, with its bid to hold the line on its own trade concerns regarding China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Friday, President Xi Jinping urged the EU to join hands with Beijing in resisting "unilateral bullying", referring to sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heads of the EU's two main institutions – the council and the European Commission – have held regular summits with China's leadership. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol returned to his private home on Friday from the official residence after his removal from office, with crowds of supporters turning out to greet his motorcade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court upheld Yoon's impeachment last Friday, capping four months of unprecedented constitutional turmoil after his short-lived attempt to impose martial law in December sent shockwaves through Asia's fourth-largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea will now hold a snap election on June 3, and questions remain over whether Yoon might still play a role given how his impeachment appears to have deepened polarisation in society and stirred up his conservative supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds had gathered outside the gates of the official residence, where Yoon briefly stopped to hug and shake hands with supporters, some of whom were crying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ousted president has not been seen in public since he was released from prison on March 8 when a court cancelled his detention warrant in the criminal case against him. He did not attend the impeachment ruling by the Constitutional Court on April 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of his ruling party members and supporters have been seen visiting the official residence where Yoon reportedly discussed the upcoming election.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he left the official residence, Yoon donned a red baseball cap saying "Make Korea Great Again" given to him by a supporter, video footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now I will go back to being one of the people... and find a new way for the country and the people," Yoon said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his wife were driven in a motorcade from the official presidential residence to their private apartment in a 37-storey building in Seoul. The pet-loving couple will also take back more than 10 dogs and cats they own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 280 police were deployed around his private home on Friday ahead of the move, and Yoon is to be accompanied by a security detail of about 50 people, media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president still faces trial on a criminal charge of leading an insurrection, which is punishable by death or a life sentence if he is convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race to replace Yoon kicked off this week with nearly 20 hopefuls expected to contest for the candidacy of the conservative People Power Party that is in a fight to retain the presidency against a populist liberal who leads in the polls. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping urged the European Union on Friday to join hands with China in resisting "unilateral bullying", in reference to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  As he met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday, Xi stressed the need for cooperation between the bloc and Beijing in weathering Trump's continual escalations in the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China and Europe should fulfil their international responsibilities... and jointly resist unilateral bullying practices," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This, he stressed, would not only "safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests, but also... safeguard international fairness and justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added there is no winner in a tariff war, and going against the world will only result in self-isolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said for more than 70 years, China has achieved development through self-reliance and does not fear unreasonable suppression.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added that no matter how the external world changes, China will remain confident and focused on running its own affairs well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez, in turn, said following the meeting in Beijing that tensions over trade should not impede cooperation between China and the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Spain and Europe have a significant trade deficit with China that we must work to rectify," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sanchez also said "we must not let trade tensions stand in the way of the potential growth of the relationship between China and Spain and between China and the EU".
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain buys about 45 billion euros of goods every year from China, its fourth-largest trading partner, but sells around 7.4 billion euros' worth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez's trip comes as the EU rethinks its global trading relationships in the face of turmoil caused by the US import duties announced last week that have sent world markets into a tailspin.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China blasted US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Friday as a "numbers game" that "will become a joke", as Beijing raised levies on US imports to 125 percent and said it would go no further.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement followed the US move to raise the "reciprocal tariffs" on Chinese imports to 125 percent, bringing the total to 145 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council's Customs Tariff Commission said the US imposition of excessively high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, goes against basic economic laws and common sense, and is nothing but unilateral bullying and coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission said even if Washington is to raise tariffs further, it would no longer make economic sense and ultimately go down as a joke in world economic history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given that it's already impossible for the Chinese market to accept US imports at the current tariff level, if the United States imposes further tariffs on Chinese products, China will ignore it," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's duties on Chinese products have "become a numbers game with no practical significance in economics", a spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 125 percent tariffs on US goods are up from 84 percent, and will take effect from Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry also said China has filed a lawsuit against the US with the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism following the latest American tariff hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The countermeasure by Beijing came after US President Donald Trump's latest escalation in a tit-for-tat trade war that he started by singling China out even as he hit a pause on additional tariffs for other countries. (Xinhua/AP)

    Trump levy looms larger for senders of small parcels

<img alt="People sending small parcels to the US will have to pay US$100 per item from May 2 and US$200 from June 1. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799912_1_20250411115603.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is continuing to see fallout from the trade war started by US President Donald Trump who raised the duty on small goods parcels from the SAR to 120 percent from the 90 percent that he had set just a day before that, and the 30 percent in his opening salvo on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the amendment in an executive order that went public on Thursday Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tariffs on parcels will go up from US$75 to US$100 from May 2 and from US$150 to US$200 from June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in tariffs closes a trade exemption rule known de minimis that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to enter the United States free of duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  It means people wanting to send small parcels worth up to US$800, which are currently exempt from any duties, to the US from the mainland, Hong Kong or Macau will now have to pay US$100 per item posted between May 2 and before June 1 and US$200 for goods sent after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The skyrocketing increase in duties comes as the number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of these packages now enter under the de minimis rule, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in duties on small goods parcels has been framed by Trump as a solution to the national emergency arising from the US trade deficits and in his starting a tit-for-tat trade war that has seen him levy a punitive 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has said no one wins in a trade war and described the tariffs as protectionist.

 Recovery efforts wrapped up in the capital of the Dominican Republic after a roof collapse at a nightclub during a concert killed at least 221 people, authorities said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As families continue to mourn their loved ones, the cause of the catastrophe and the exact number of people who attended the fateful event have not yet been determined by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sudden collapse at the Jet Set club in Santo Domingo after midnight on Tuesday marred a concert by merengue singer Rubby Perez where politicians, athletes and other prominent local figures had gathered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today the search, rescue and recovery of victims ended," presidential spokesperson Homero Figueroa said in a video the government posted on social media. "Now it is time to move on to another phase, that of understanding and explaining what happened."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dominican government has approved creating a team of national and international experts to clarify the causes of the roof collapse at the popular venue, Figueroa said in the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency teams, that were on site until Thursday morning, pulled nearly 200 survivors from the building in the hours following the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Manuel Mendez, head of the country's emergency operations center (COE), said, "This is the hardest task I've had in my 20 years of leading the COE," breaking down in tears.
  <br>
  <br>
  After recovery efforts ended, the families of those missing left the area surrounding the nightclub, where they had stood for days embracing each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez, the singer, was among those killed in the crush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominican President Luis Abinader attended his funeral on Thursday, with a public memorial service for him set to follow later in the day. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's defence minister on Thursday urged his counterparts from around 30 countries to press ahead with plans to deploy troops to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia, as questions remained over whether the United States would provide backup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairing the first defence ministers' meeting of the Coalition of the Willing, UK Defence Secretary John Healey said its members must ensure "that we’re fully prepared for the moment a peace agreement is reached.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must be ready for when that peace comes. That’s why the work of this coalition is so vital," Healey said at Nato headquarters in Brussels. He added that 200 military planners have been developing plans to deepen European involvement in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on social media, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said that “Ukraine is ready for peace - one that is just and backed by strength.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian government officials and military analysts have said that Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in Ukraine in the coming weeks to maximise pressure on Kyiv and strengthen the Kremlin’s negotiating position in ceasefire talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As usual with coalition gatherings, the United States did not take part. The success of the coalition’s operation hinges on US backup with airpower or other military assistance, but the Trump administration has made no public commitment to provide support.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland underlined the “crucial” role of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, representatives from around 50 nations will gather at Nato to drum up military support for Ukraine. That meeting will be chaired by Britain and Germany. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to join the meeting via video from Washington. (AP)

 Six people, including three children, were killed after a sightseeing helicopter crashed into the Hudson River in New York on Thursday, sparking a major water rescue operation, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The crash killed all those onboard the aircraft: the pilot and a family from Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the victims were initially taken to a hospital, but later succumbed to their injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this time, all six victims have been removed from the water. And sadly, all six victims have been pronounced deceased," Mayor Eric Adams told a briefing, after earlier calling it a "heartbreaking and tragic crash."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chopper's landing skids were seen protruding from the river beside a tunnel vent as several boats clustered around the impact site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police from both New York and New Jersey, which is on the opposite side of the river from Manhattan, responded to the scene along with fire department vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBC4 channel reported that its own helicopter was unable to take off because of weather conditions, with the weather in New York on Thursday gusty under thick cloud cover.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses told the outlet that a rotor blade had come loose from the aircraft, while footage on social media showed pieces of the aircraft breaking off and the helicopter plunging into the waterway.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A Bell 206 helicopter crashed and is submerged in the Hudson River in New York City," the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate."
  <br>
  <br>
  New York City Police commissioner Jessica Tisch said the helicopter took off around 3 pm, flying south before heading up the Manhattan shoreline to the George Washington Bridge turning back towards the downtown Manhattan heliport, losing control and hitting the water near a Hoboken pier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police commissioner said the aircraft was operated by New York Helicopter which did not respond to a request for comment but lists the Bell 206 among its fleet. (AFP)

<img alt="Donald Trump is said to have posted a few minutes after Wall Street opened that 'IT'S TIME TO BUY', hours before he announced a 90-day suspension of additional tariffs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several American senators have called for an investigation into whether US President Donald Trump engaged in insider trading or market manipulation by encouraging people to buy stocks just before his dramatic reversal on global tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Who in the administration knew about Trump's latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public's expense?" California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff posted on X on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm writing to the White House – the public has a right to know," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee wrote on X that "the President of the United States is literally engaging in the world's biggest market manipulation scheme."
  <br>
  <br>
  The accusations came as Trump posted a few minutes after Wall Street opened that "IT'S TIME TO BUY".
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours later, he announced a 90-day suspension of additional tariffs against dozens of countries, with the exception of China, triggering a historic stock market rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  After several days of collapse, the Dow Jones index ended Wednesday up 7.87 percent, its biggest gain since 2008, and the Nasdaq up 12.16 percent, the most since 2001.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also signed his post on Truth Social with the letters "DJT" – both his initials and the stock market abbreviation for his media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The company's shares closed the day up 21.67 percent. (AFP)

    Trump wants to 'make showers great again'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order lifting water-pressure restrictions on showerheads, a move the White House said would "make America's showers great again".
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long complained about inadequate water pressure in American bathrooms, which he blames on federal water-conservation regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In my case I like to take a nice shower, to take care of my beautiful hair," Trump said as he signed the order in the Oval Office on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to stand under the shower for 15 minutes till it gets wet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It comes out drip, drip, drip. It's ridiculous."
  <br>
  <br>
  The order directs the Energy Department to roll back "radical green" regulations limiting the flow of showerheads to 9.5 litres of water per minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the order "frees Americans from excessive regulations that turned a basic household item into a bureaucratic nightmare" and ends the "Obama-Biden war on showers".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has targeted water-pressure standards for showerheads, toilets, dishwashers and other household appliances, since his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My hair, I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect, perfect," he said outside the White House in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I take a shower, I want that beautiful head of hair to be just lathered," Trump said in Detroit in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I get this best stuff you can buy and I dump it all over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then I turn on the water and the damn water drips out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't get the stuff out of my hair. It's a horrible thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  But according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, "shower head standards save consumers money on their water and energy bills and help the environment".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Testing has repeatedly shown that today's models can provide an excellent shower," the NGO said in a 2024 report. (AFP)

<img alt="Data centres' global electricity consumption has increased by 12 percent annually over the past five years. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799751_1_20250410130449.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Electricity consumption by data centres will more than double by 2030, driven by artificial intelligence applications that will create new challenges for energy security and CO2 emission goals, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, AI can unlock opportunities to produce and consume electricity more efficiently, the agency said in its first report on the energy implications of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data centres represented about 1.5 percent of global electricity consumption in 2024, but that has increased by 12 percent annually over the past five years. Generative AI requires colossal computing power to process information accumulated in gigantic databases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together, the United States, Europe, and China currently account for about 85 percent of data centre consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big tech companies increasingly recognise their growing need for power. Google last year signed a deal to get electricity from small nuclear reactors to help power its part in the artificial intelligence race.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the current rate, data centres will consume about three percent of global energy by 2030, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the IEA, data centre electricity consumption will reach about 945 terawatt hours by 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is slightly more than Japan's total electricity consumption today. AI is the most important driver of this growth, alongside growing demand for other digital services," said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  One 100 megawatt data centre can use as much power as 100,000 households, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it highlighted that new data centres, already under construction, could use as much as two million households. (AFP)

    S Korean opposition leader opens presidential bid

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, widely seen as the frontrunner in a presidential by-election triggered by the removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol last week, officially announced a presidential bid on Thursday, vowing to heal a starkly divided nation through economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, led the liberal Democratic Party’s campaign to oust the former president over his December declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee recently stepped down as the party’s chairman to focus on campaigning for the June 3 election. He is considered the clear frontrunner in party's primary. Kim Dong-yeon, the Democratic governor of Gyeonggi province and a longtime financial policymaker, also told reporters on Wednesday that he intends to run for president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s downfall has left the conservative People Power Party in disarray, with roughly 10 politicians expected to seek the nomination, reflecting a split between Yoon loyalists, who still control the party’s leadership, and reformists calling for a fresh start.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video message, Lee said that Yoon’s martial law saga exposed the country’s deep divisions and social conflicts, and argued that the root cause was a widening rich-poor gap. He promised aggressive government spending to jolt economic growth and ease income polarisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have more than we did in the past, but wealth is too concentrated in certain areas,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With economic growth rates declining worldwide, it has become difficult to maintain and develop an economy solely on the strength of the private sector. However, with government-led talent development and extensive investments in technological research and development, we can revive the economy.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said it was crucial to maintain a robust alliance with the United States and to pursue three-way cooperation with Japan, but he stressed that South Korea’s national interest should come first in “every decision”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who has served as a lawmaker, provincial governor and city mayor, is adored by supporters for his outspoken style and has long positioned himself as an anti-elitist.
  <br>
  <br>
  His critics view him as a populist who stokes division and demonises conservative opponents, while failing to offer realistic funding plans to achieve his ambitious goals. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dominican Republic rescue workers ended the search for survivors of a nightclub roof collapse as the death toll surpassed 180 in the Caribbean nation's worst disaster in decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel late on Wednesday reported 60 more deaths compared to the morning's count, with the total confirmed tally reaching 184.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official statement had earlier said that "all reasonable possibilities of finding more survivors" had been exhausted, and the focus of the operation will turn to recovering bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we will complete the rescue effort," said Jose Luis Frometa Herasme, head of the fire service in the Dominican capital Santo Domingo, where the tragedy ocurred at the Jet Set nightclub in the early hours of Tuesday, sending shockwaves through the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives of missing people were still waiting desperately for news on Wednesday of their loved ones outside the ruined club, at hospitals and at the local morgue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 300 rescue workers, aided by sniffer dogs, had spent two days combing through mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets, supported by firefighters from Puerto Rico and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial images of the site showed a scene resembling the aftermath of an earthquake, with a gaping hole where the roof of the club – a fixture of Santo Domingo's nightlife for half a century – had been.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 500 people were also injured when the roof caved in while renowned merengue singer Rubby Perez was performing for a crowd of hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez and two former Major League Baseball players were among the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Luis Abinader has declared three days of national mourning. (AFP)

<img alt="Mark Carney and his wife Diana Fox are targeted because of a photograph showing them with Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799735_1_20250410115043.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is leaning into his banking background as his country fights a trade war with the United States, but his financial ties have also made him a target for conspiracy theories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Incorporating tropes familiar to followers of the far-right QAnon movement, conspiratorial social media posts about the Liberal leader have surged ahead of the country's April 28 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Posts range from false claims he recited a "satanic chant" at a campaign event to AI-generated images of him in a pool with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the ideal person to be targeted here, for sure, due to his background, as well as his financial work," said Ahmed Al-Rawi, an associate professor of communications at Canada's Simon Fraser University.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before serving as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, Carney had a lucrative career as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mentioning a candidate's affiliation with the global financial elite, and particularly the World Economic Forum, has become a dog whistle for the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Conservatives have leapt to highlight Carney's connections to the annual gathering in Davos, with party leader Pierre Poilievre in January describing him as "the voice for the billionaire globalist elite that have been impoverishing the working class around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-establishment sentiment is present on the left, but Al-Rawi noted people trying to associate Carney with a supposed circle of nefarious elites were "mostly far-right players and provocateurs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many posts have zeroed in on a picture from a festival in Britain showing Carney and his wife standing next to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  This 2013 photo is authentic, but it precipitated the spread of several AI-generated images shared to emphasize a supposed link between Carney and Epstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian Digital Media Research Network found a small number of bot accounts pushed the association by replying to posts from Canadian political figures. Once larger accounts began to engage with the claims, millions of views rolled in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al-Rawi said for conspiracy theorists, a grain of truth mixed with fabricated evidence is enough for a claim to truly take hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman with the Carney campaign said the claims being spread were "false and disinformation" and said any insinuated connection with Maxwell was incorrect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She went to high school with Mark Carney's wife's sister," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although they may have bumped into each other in public settings, they are not friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts said engagement with the claims appears to be somewhat contained to groups already critical of Carney's Liberal Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carmen Celestini, an assistant professor in religious studies at the University of Waterloo, said the push appears to be building on attacks that were successful in hitting Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just sort of makes sense to move those conspiracy theories towards Carney," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls indicate that Carney's replacement of Trudeau coincided with a surge in Liberal support. (AFP)
