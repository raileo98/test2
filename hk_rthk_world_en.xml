    US defends decision to supply landmines to Ukraine

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US decision to send anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine – in a major policy shift – was triggered by a change in Russian battlefield tactics favouring infantry over mechanised units, US Defence Secretary Loyd Austin said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "They don't lead with their mechanised forces any more," Austin told reporters while on a visit to Laos. "They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanised forces."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainians "have a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Joe Biden's reversal of his previous curbs on US landmines comes just days after Washington gave Ukraine the green light to use US-made long-range missiles on targets within Russia, as the outgoing administration aims to give Kyiv the upper hand before President-elect Donald Trump enters office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden in 2022 said the United States would mostly ban its use of landmines, at the time specifically drawing a contrast with Russia's use of the weapons in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reversal comes amid concerns about the incoming Trump administration's lack of support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is entering office having repeatedly criticised US assistance for Ukraine, claiming he could secure a ceasefire within hours – comments that have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about Ukraine's ability to withstand the Russian attacks without American support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Russia and the United States – neither of which are signatories to the UN Mine Ban Treaty – have been criticised for their past use of anti-personnel mines in the past. Ukraine is a signatory of the treaty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Austin said the US-supplied mines would be so-called "nonpersistent" mines that can self-destruct or render themselves inactive after losing battery charge – in theory limiting the risk to civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Moscow and Kyiv are jockeying to secure battlefield advantage before Trump assumes office next January.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week, Kyiv fired US-supplied ATACMS missiles at Russian territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree lowering the threshold for when Russia could use nuclear weapons. (AFP)

    President Xi Jinping begins state visit to Brazil

<img alt="Xi Jinping and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva showed their deepening bilateral ties by signing cooperation accords on trade, technology and environmental protection. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780168_2_20241121072551.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called for "more voices" to end the Ukraine war and a ceasefire in Gaza, as he conducted a state visit to Brazil's capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said Xi wanted to see "more voices committed to peace to pave the way for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis" and "a ceasefire and an end to the war at an early date" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the appeal during a state visit to Brasilia, where he was hosted by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Brasilia have advanced a joint roadmap for peace in Ukraine that has been endorsed by Moscow but rejected by Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a world plagued by armed conflicts and political strife, China and Brazil put peace, diplomacy and dialogue first," Lula said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's appeal for a halt to fighting in Gaza - where Israel is pressing an offensive against Hamas - echoed one he and the other G20 leaders made during a summit held Monday and Tuesday in Rio.
  <br>
  <br>
  That summit's joint statement called for a "comprehensive" ceasefire in both Gaza and Lebanon, where Israel is also waging an offensive against the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's state visit to Brasilia showcased closer relations between the biggest economies in Asia and Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders signed 35 cooperation accords on areas including agriculture, trade, technology and environmental protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China-Brazil relations "are at their best in history" and the two countries are now "reliable friends," according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula said he looked forward to welcoming Xi to Brazil again next July for a Brics summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit to Brazil's capital comes fresh off his attendance at a G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, and an Apec summit last week in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese leader figured prominently at both summits, in contrast with outgoing US President Joe Biden, who cut a spectral figure as fellow leaders looked past him, politically, to the coming presidency of Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  That difference also spoke to China's ascendant role as a trade partner and investor in Latin America, and expectations that America under Trump will erect trade and migration barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula welcomed Xi with full honours, greeting him on the red carpet as horse-mounted guards rode past, a military brass band played their national anthems, and lines of children waved Chinese and Brazilian flags. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis on Wednesday said he will canonise Carlo Acutis next April, setting the eagerly awaited date for the late teenager to become the Catholic Church’s first millennial and digital-era saint.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis made the announcement at the end of his weekly general audience on Wednesday, saying he would proclaim the church's youngest contemporary saint during the Jubilee of Adolescents at the Vatican on April 25-27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials later confirmed the canonisation Mass would occur on April 27 at the Vatican.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acutis, who was born to Italian parents in London, was a web designer who died of leukaemia in Italy in 2006 at the age of 15. Francis beatified him in 2020 in Assisi, where his tomb draws a steady stream of pilgrims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touted as the “patron saint of the internet,” Acutis used his natural tech talent to create a website to catalog miracles and took care of websites for some local Catholic organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis announced in May that he had approved a second miracle attributed to Acutis’ intercession, paving the way for Wednesday’s announcement. (AP)

    Ukraine criticises Western allies for embassy closures

Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780170_1_20241121075353.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Wednesday called on its Western allies not to fuel tensions inside the country, after a string of embassies in Kyiv announced they would close, citing the threat of a "massive air attack" on the capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  The warnings of fresh strikes come as Moscow looks to retaliate against Ukraine for firing US-supplied long-range missiles at Russian territory for the first time and with the Kremlin accusing outgoing US President Joe Biden of dragging out the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has already ramped up a wave of deadly missile strikes in recent days, targeting residential areas and Ukraine's energy grid. Air alerts blare out across the country daily.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States led the wave of closures, saying it was shutting its Kyiv office to the public after having received "specific information of a potential significant air attack" on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not provide further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece, Hungary, Italy and Spain – all Nato members – followed suit, announcing the closures of their diplomatic premises in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian officials criticised the rare move and called on its allies not to spread yet more fear among Ukrainian society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv said the "information" the US was referring to looked to be a "psychological operation" launched by Moscow in a bid to destabilise the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remind you that the threat of strikes by the aggressor state has unfortunately been a daily reality for Ukrainians for over 1,000 days," Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nerves are already frayed in Kyiv after almost three years of war, and Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has injected fresh uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has repeatedly criticised US support for Ukraine and claimed he could broker a ceasefire within hours – comments that have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about Ukraine's ability to withstand the Russian attacks without American support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Ukraine and Russia are jockeying for the upper hand on the battlefield before he re-enters the White House in January. (AFP)

<img alt='US Director Joel Souza - author of the "Rust" movie, talks during an AFP interview at Camerimage film festival in Torun, Poland.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Western "Rust" will get its world premiere on Wednesday at a Polish film festival, three years after its cinematographer was killed in a tragic on-set shooting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hollywood star Alec Baldwin was accused of violating basic gun safety rules in the 2021 death of Halyna Hutchins, but his involuntary manslaughter trial collapsed earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hutchins's mother refused to attend the premiere "when there is still no justice for my daughter".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologise to me and take responsibility for her death," Olga Solovey said Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, will introduce the movie at the Camerimage film festival -- known for celebrating cinematography -- in Torun, northern Poland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the "massive devastation" of the shooting left him an emotional wreck.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Rust' just became this sort of insane hurricane," he told AFP. "You're just left to sort of pick up the pieces."
  <br>
  <br>
  The filmmaker admitted that he agonised over whether to complete the movie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely on the fence... There was a time when I thought I just didn't want to make movies anymore," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said what convinced him to finish it was learning that Hutchins's husband wanted her final work to be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Camerimage said it was also Hutchins's "dream" to have her work shown at the festival, but that "Baldwin will not be there".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Emmy-winning actor was holding a revolver during a rehearsal on set in New Mexico when a live round was fired, fatally wounding 42-year-old Hutchins.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a tragic irony, the film centres on an accidental killing -- a parallel that Souza called "unsettling".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a strange one to unpack. When people hear about it, they generally fall silent for a few moments because they can't believe" it, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Souza and Baldwin developed the script from research Souza was doing on the youngest person ever to be hanged in the Old West.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rust" tells the story of an outlaw who rides to rescue his 13-year-old grandson from execution for an accident being treated as murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter for accidentally loading Baldwin's prop gun with a live round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baldwin's own trial spectacularly collapsed in July when it emerged that prosecutors had not turned over a batch of bullets that detectives had found during their investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Filming was halted by the fatal incident, but completed last year on location in Montana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hutchins, a former journalist who grew up in Ukraine, had been named as one of the industry's rising stars in 2019 by American Cinematographer magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the tragedy prompted some calls for banning firearms from sets altogether, new Hollywood guidelines now specify that only an armourer can hand a weapon to an actor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said Baldwin was handed the gun on set by the film's first assistant director, who later pleaded guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Souza said "the safety bulletin doesn't go quite far enough. I think they should mandate that no real weapons be used."
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Rust" premiere is not the only controversy at the festival, whosejury is presided over this year by Oscar winner Cate Blanchett.
  <br>
  <br>
  French director Coralie Fargeat pulled her movie starring Demi Moore, "The Substance" -- which won best screenplay at Cannes -- "after discovering the highly misogynistic and offensive words" of festival founder Marek Zydowicz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zydowicz was forced to apologise after appearing to suggest that including more women cinematographers might lead to "mediocre film production" in the line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remarks, for which Zydowicz later apologised, also led Oscar-winning director British director Steve McQueen, a double Oscar winner for "12 Years A Slave", to also stay away in protest at what he called the "deeply offensive words". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Thai woman was sentenced to death on Wednesday for poisoning a friend with cyanide, in the first of her 14 murder trials.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sararat Rangsiwuthaporn, 36, an online gambling addict, is accused of swindling thousands of dollars from her victims before killing them with the chemical.
  <br>
  <br>
  A court in Bangkok convicted her on Wednesday for fatally poisoning her friend Siriporn Kanwong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two met up near Bangkok in April last year to release fish into the Mae Klong river as part of a Buddhist ritual.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siriporn collapsed and died shortly afterwards and investigators found traces of cyanide in her body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were then able to link Sararat to previously unsolved cyanide poisonings going back as far as 2015, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The court's decision is just," Siriporn's mother, Tongpin Kiatchanasiri, told reporters following the verdict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to tell my daughter that I miss her deeply, and justice has been done for her today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said Sararat funded her gambling addiction by borrowing money from her victims -- in one case as much as 300,000 baht (nearly US$9,000) -- before killing them and stealing their jewellery and mobile phones.
  <br>
  <br>
  She lured 15 people -- one of whom survived -- to take poisoned "herb capsules", they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sararat faces 13 more separate murder trials, and has been charged with around 80 offences in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her ex-husband -- a police lieutenant-colonel -- was given 16 months in prison and her former lawyer two years for complicity in Siriporn's killing, the lawyer for the victim's family said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand has been the scene of several sordid and high-profile criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this year, six foreigners were found dead in a luxury Bangkok hotel after a cyanide poisoning believed to be connected to debts worth millions of baht. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean super producer behind the chart-topping girl band NewJeans resigned from her label Wednesday, following a protracted legal battle with BTS's agency HYBE that has rocked the country's K-pop industry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Min Hee-jin announced her departure in a statement following what she called a "hellish dispute with HYBE" and vowed legal action against the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The saga began in April, when HYBE launched an audit of subsidiary ADOR -- NewJeans' label -- and attempted to push Min out, accusing her of breach of trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move sparked a sprawling legal and PR battle, with Min accusing HYBE of copying her star-making formula for a competing girl band, which has seen the boardroom workings of K-pop hashed out in South Korean courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Min slammed HYBE's action against her as a "witch hunt" in a statement Wednesday, saying she would take "necessary legal actions" against the company and individuals over the dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she would embark on "new K-pop journey" in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Min, who joined the industry in the early 2000s, is widely regarded as one of the most successful producers in K-pop, having worked with stars such as Girls' Generation, EXO and SHINee.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans, a K-pop phenomenon that made its debut in 2022 and whose members are all under 20, is among HYBE's most successful K-pop groups along with BTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has topped global charts, including the Billboard 200, and broke the Guinness World Record last year for "Fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify".
  <br>
  <br>
  The members of NewJeans have publicly shown full support for Min and demanded that she be reinstated as ADOR's CEO at a livestream in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The girl group also sent a formal legal notice to HYBE last week, demanding six specific actions, including reinstating Min, and warning that failure to meet them could lead to the termination of their exclusive contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  ADOR said in a statement Wednesday that it was "regrettable that Min unilaterally notified us of her resignation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "ADOR will continue to provide our fullest support to NewJeans to help them grow and thrive even further," it said. (AFP)

<img alt="Family members of drug trafficking inmate Mary Jane Veloso hold placards pleading for help. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780123_2_20241120193418.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Wednesday that a deal has been reached for Indonesia to send home a Filipino death-row drug convict who was nearly executed by firing squad but got a reprieve due to years of pleadings from Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  Marcos thanked Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and his government for granting a longstanding Philippine request for Mary Jane Veloso to be brought back home to serve her sentence in her country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Mary Jane Veloso is coming home,” Marcos said in a statement. “Arrested in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death, Mary Jane’s case has been a long and difficult journey.”
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear when Veloso would be flown back to the Philippines, but Marcos said he looked forward to welcoming her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Law, Human Rights and Immigration, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, confirmed that Subianto has given his approval for Veloso's return to the Philippines. That may happen in December, as long as conditions were met, including her continued detention in her country as part of the Indonesian court's sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines should also shoulder the costs of her repatriation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said at a news conference in Manila that Filipino authorities would discuss the legal terms of Veloso's transfer with their Indonesian counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indonesian government has asked the Department of Justice in Manila to formally request Veloso's transfer back to the Philippines, Justice Department spokesperson Mico Clavano said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision, Marcos said, “is a reflection of the depth our nation’s partnership with Indonesia — united in a shared commitment to justice and compassion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso's transfer would remove the possibility of her facing an execution because the Philippines, Asia’s largest Roman Catholic nation, has long abolished the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2015, Indonesian authorities moved Veloso to an island prison where she and eight other drug convicts were scheduled to be executed by firing squad despite objections from the convicts' home countries, including Australia, Brazil, France, Ghana and Nigeria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia executed the eight other convicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso’s case has caused a public outcry in the Philippines, where her family and supporters contend she is innocent and was unaware that 2.6 kilograms of heroin was concealed in her suitcase. The drugs were discovered when she entered Indonesia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso travelled to Indonesia in 2010 where her godsister reportedly told her a job as a domestic worker awaited her. Her godsister also allegedly provided the suitcase where the prohibited drugs were found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine authorities had filed criminal complaints, including for human trafficking, against illegal Filipino recruiters who arranged for Veloso to work in Indonesia, Clavano said. She added that she would serve as a crucial witness in the trial of the suspects when she returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  That Philippine case helped convince Indonesian authorities to delay Veloso's execution and eventually consider her transfer back to her country, Clavano said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos said Veloso’s story resonated with many in the Philippines, as “a mother trapped by the grip of poverty, who made one desperate choice that altered the course of her life."
  <br>
  <br>
  “While she was held accountable under Indonesian law, she remains a victim of her circumstances," Marcos said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines has been a global source of manual labour, including many impoverished women who abandon their families for higher-paying jobs and better opportunities abroad. Alarming abuse, especially of Filipina house helpers, has prompted Philippine authorities to impose restrictions and safeguards but many continue to be exploited.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 59 Filipinos around the world face the death penalty mostly for drug and murder convictions, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said. (AP)

<img alt="Former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, Linda McMahon, will be tasked with leading the US Department of Education under the new Trump administration. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780049_1_20241120123007.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump nominated Linda McMahon, former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, on Tuesday to lead the Department of Education, which he has pledged to abolish.
 <br>
  <br>
  He described McMahon as a "fierce advocate for Parents' Rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  McMahon is a co-chair of Trump's transition team ahead of his return to the White House in January. It is tasked with filling some 4,000 positions in the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding McMahon's experience in education, Trump cited her two-year stint on the Connecticut Board of Education and 16 years on the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University, a private Catholic school.
  <br>
  <br>
  McMahon left WWE in 2009 to run for a seat in the US Senate, and has been a major donor to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2021, she has chaired the Centre For The American Worker at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the election campaign Trump promised to do away with the federal education department when he returns to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I say it all the time. I'm dying to get back to do this. We will ultimately eliminate the federal Department of Education," he said in September during a rally in Wisconsin.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Republican convention in Milwaukee, McMahon said she was "privileged to call Donald Trump a colleague and a boss," as well as "a friend."
  <br>
  <br>
  Her ties with Trump go back to her years in the professional wrestling industry -- she said she first met him as chief executive at WWE.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2017, she was confirmed as the head of the Small Business Administration, which is responsible for supporting America's millions of small businesses, which employ around half the country's private-sector workforce.
  <br>
  <br>
  In nominating her, Trump pointed to her experience in business, helping to grow the WWE.
  <br>
  <br>
  After leaving the administration, she served as chair of the pro-Trump America First Action SuperPAC, or political action committee. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Internet Conference officially got underway in Wuzhen of Zhejiang province on Wednesday, with President Xi Jinping calling for faster innovative and secure development of cyberspace to create a better digital future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit — the country's biggest internet forum — focuses on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking via a video link, Xi said the new technology had brought both opportunities and unpredictable challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  “New technologies, like AI, are flourishing. This has greatly enhanced humanity's capacity to understand and shape the world we live in, and at the same time presented us with a series of unpredictable risks and challenges,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China would work with other countries in information revolution and development to harness the internet’s potential for greater global benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China stands ready to work with all countries to seize the historical initiative in information revolution and development, and build a community with a shared future in cyberspace, so that together we can enable the internet to deliver greater benefits to the people and to the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang said the country's cutting-edge technologies had delivered fruitful outcomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So far, China has put in place the world's largest network infrastructure with advanced technology and the internet has been available to 78 percent of the population.” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding proposed four points for building a shared future in cyberspace, including improving global governance, strengthening tech collaboration, promoting fairness and universal benefits in internet use, and upholding laws and regulations for cybersecurity protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concluding his speech, the vice premier and Politburo Standing Committee member expressed hopes for active dialogue during the summit to build a shared future in cyberspace.

    AI plays big role in peacekeeping: Unesco

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Artificial intelligence is playing a bigger role in peacekeeping with real-time AI translation making it easier for nations to communicate, says Unesco’s chair in AI and data science for society.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lampros Stergioulas, who is attending the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, says he hopes this year’s summit can address both the benefits and risks of using AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect to see some agreements about cross-border data exchanges and at least some agreements in principle on data exchange standards that can be used for AI training,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Also] agreement on exchange of information because it's important to have open exchange of these developments, otherwise we will go into very dangerous territory as a planet.”
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit - the country's biggest annual internet forum - focuses on AI and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  On its impact on diplomacy, Stergioulas said AI translation applications can ensure, “diplomatic affairs and dialogue between nations happen in a more immediate and constructive manner.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hague University of Applied Sciences scholar added that AI-powered tools, such as drones and robots, could help support humanitarian missions in conflict and disaster zones.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Drones can be also used to deliver aid and relief and resources to people that need it very quickly. The same with robots in the ground or dangerous zones, for example. We need to build a lot more infrastructure on that and not just focus on the military use," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Stergioulas admitted that the new technology was a double-edged sword, stressing the need for AI ethics and regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example drones used in warfare... there's a lot of development of autonomous weapons and some concerns there really from almost every country and almost every army in the world, so there are some great challenges we need to be aware of,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, Unesco pioneered a globally-accepted AI ethics framework which aims to keep AI safe and secure and under human control.

    SpaceX fails to repeat Starship booster catch

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Donald Trump attended the launch as a guest of Elon Musk. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779999_1_20241120073943.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX's Starship mega-rocket blasted off on its latest test flight on Tuesday, with US President-elect Donald Trump joining Elon Musk to witness the spectacle firsthand in the latest sign of their ever-closer ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican leader was deprived of the chance to see the booster stage caught in the launch tower's "chopstick" arms, an engineering marvel demonstrated by the company last month and one he personally lauded during his election victory speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, the colossal Super Heavy first stage made a more subdued splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Company representatives cited unmet technical criteria, dampening the triumph of an event attended by a bevvy of Trump-world figures, including Donald Trump Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Trump greeted Musk warmly on Tuesday afternoon, sporting a red Maga hat as the pair headed off to watch from the control tower of the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, where the rocket blasted off at 4pm local time (2200 GMT) on the sixth test flight for Starship.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX founder and CEO Musk has been a constant presence at Trump's side since the incoming president's election victory, joining him at a meeting with Argentina's President Javier Milei and even at a UFC bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's decision to travel to Musk's home turf was the latest sign of the growing alliance between the billionaire duo, which has raised questions over possible conflicts of interests given SpaceX's lucrative contracts with Nasa and the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's launch marked the quickest turnaround between test flights for the world's most powerful rocket, a gleaming, 121-metre-tall stainless steel colossus central to Musk's ambition of colonising Mars and making humanity a multiplanetary species.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk aims to launch the first uncrewed missions to the Red Planet as early as 2026, coinciding with the next "Mars transfer window" – a period when the journey between Earth and Mars is at its shortest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa is also counting on a specialised version of Starship to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface later this decade under its Artemis program.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flight six of Starship was seen as a test of whether SpaceX's first booster catch was pure precision or relied on a stroke of luck after Musk – perhaps inadvertently – disclosed how close the last flight came to disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a clip posted to X showcasing his gaming chops in "Diablo IV," sharp-eared fans caught an employee briefing him that the Super Heavy booster was "one second away" from a system failure that could have spelt catastrophe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starship's upper stage will make a partial orbit of Earth, re-enter the atmosphere and splash down in the Indian Ocean a little over an hour later, but this time in the daylight, providing clearer visuals for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key milestones include reigniting Starship's Raptor engines for the first time in space and trialling new heat shield materials. The flight also carries Starship's first ever payload – a stuffed banana – and serves as a swan song for the current generation of Starship prototypes.
  <br>
  <br>
  With twice the thrust of the Saturn V rockets that powered Apollo missions, Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built. Musk has already teased that its successor, Starship V3, will be "3X more powerful" and could take flight within a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight comes as Musk is riding high on Trump's November 5 White House win, having campaigned extensively for the returning Republican leader, as well as donating staggering sums from his own fortune to the cause.
  <br>
  <br>
  His loyalty has paid off. Musk has been tapped to co-lead a new "Department of Government Efficiency" – or Doge, a cheeky nod to the meme-based cryptocurrency Musk loves to promote.
  <br>
  <br>
  That in turn has led to concerns Musk could engage in "self-dealing" as the CEO is poised to straddle the line between government insider and corporate titan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics worry he could sway regulatory decisions to benefit his six companies, including SpaceX and its marquee Starship programme, which has faced launch delays linked to an environmental review the company called "superfluous." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine fired six US-made ATACMS missiles at Russia’s Bryansk region, Russia’s defence ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine claimed it hit a military weapons depot in Bryansk in the middle of the night, though it didn't specify what weapons it used. The Ukrainian General Staff said that multiple explosions and detonation were heard in the targeted area.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, the Russian defence ministry said the military shot down five Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, and damaged one more.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British farmers massed in London on Tuesday, calling on the Labour government to scrap plans to change inheritance tax rules for land ownership, which they say threatens the agriculture sector and food production.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tractors with banners calling the move "the final straw" for the beleaguered sector drove around Parliament Square, while farmers lobbied lawmakers and others called for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's administration to think again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've brought thousands of farmers to London to explain to the government that farmers are food producers, and this ludicrous budget is going to put us all out of business," farmer Olly Harrison told AFP from the protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Farmers just simply will pack up... it's just too much for us -- we've just had enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Although on a smaller scale, the demonstrations are reminiscent of protests when an earlier Labour government incensed rural communities in the early 2000s with a plan to ban foxhunting with dogs in England and Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2002, countryside campaigners estimated that 400,000 people marched through London to oppose the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Farmers Union president Tom Bradshaw, said the latest protests would continue for as long as it takes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They (the government) cannot have a policy in place which has such disastrous human impacts and think we're going to go quiet," he told Sky News television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bradshaw met Environment Secretary Steve Reed on Monday and said afterwards he had shown a "level of understanding".
  <br>
  <br>
  But both sides appear to be digging in, as the new Labour government tries to claw back what it says is a £22-billion (US$28-billion) blackhole in public finances left by the last Conservative administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  In France and other European countries farmers have also been protesting over increased pressure on their revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Central to the row in Britain, where farmers have been struggling due to lack of funding and post-Brexit labour shortages, is how farms could be taxed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farming businesses previously qualified for 100-percent relief on inheritance tax on agricultural and business property, reducing the amounts that farmers and landowners pay when farmland is passed on after a death.
  <br>
  <br>
  From April 6, 2026, however, total exemption from death duties will only apply to the first £1 million (US$1.27 million) of combined agricultural and business property.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any estate valued above that will have to pay a 20-percent tax rate -- half the standard applied to other land and property -- over 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government maintains the actual threshold before paying inheritance tax could be as much as £3 million (US$3.8 million), once exemptions for each partner in a couple and for the farm property are taken into account.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said Monday "the vast majority of farms" will not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the NFU insists that more farms may have to pay the tax when land, property and equipment are taken into account. It points to environment ministry figures that show that 66 percent of farm businesses in England have a net value of more than £1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our numbers suggest that 75 percent of commercial farms, those farms producing this country's food, are caught in the eye of this storm," said Bradshaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farmers fear the financial burden will force farms to be broken up and sold as result of the policy, hitting food production and supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 1,800 farmers lobbied MPs in London on Tuesday, winning support from the opposition Conservative party. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch claimed Labour "clearly doesn't understand or care about rural communities".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tim Farron, environment spokesman for the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats, said direct agricultural subsidies had fallen by 20 percent in real terms since 2015, and 8,100 farms were lost across the country in 2023. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Major EU countries are ready to provide defence and financial aid to Ukraine if the United States reduces support, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking on the 1,000th day of the Russian invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, as foreign ministers from six major European countries held talks in Warsaw dominated by the war and Donald Trump's return to power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top diplomats from France, Germany, Italy and Poland joined the meeting, while Britain's David Lammy and Spain's Jose Manuel Albares took part by video.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I note with appreciation the readiness of the largest European Union countries to assume the burden of military and financial support for Ukraine in the context of a possible reduction in US involvement," Sikorski told reporters after the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warsaw gathering followed a meeting of all EU foreign ministers in Brussels and comes as Trump's return to the White House threatens a drastic change in US policy nearly three years into the Russian attack on Ukraine. (AFP)

    Rape victim Gisele Pelicot condemns machoism

<img alt="Gisele Pelicot arrives at the courthouse for the trial of her former partner Dominique Pelicot. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779937_1_20241119194127.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gisele Pelicot, the French woman drugged by her ex-husband so she could be raped and sexually abused by him and dozens of strangers, said on Tuesday that it was time for a "macho" society to change its attitude on rape.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It's time that the macho, patriarchal society that trivialises rape changes," said Gisele Pelicot in her closing statement at the trial of her ex-husband and dozens of other men on rape charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's time we changed the way we look at rape," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since early September her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot has been in the dock in the southern city of Avignon along with 49 other men. Another defendant is still at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele Pelicot has become a feminist icon by refusing to be ashamed and demanding the trial be open to the public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele, 71, said the marathon hearings marked a trial of "cowardice" on the part of the men who took part in the rapes organised by her husband.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen people take the stand who deny rape, and some who admit it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to say to these men: at what point did Mrs Pelicot give you her consent when you entered the room? At what point do you become aware of this inert body? At what point do you not report it to the police?"
  <br>
  <br>
  None of her abusers alerted the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can hear this gentleman saying 'a finger is not rape'," Gisele Pelicot added, in reference to testimony from another defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have counted around 200 instances of rape, most of them by her husband and more than 90 by strangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele said her former husband "had a lot of fantasies that I couldn't fulfil".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But why did it come to this? I think what he wanted was Mrs Pelicot and not someone else," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As I didn't want to go to a swingers' club, he thought he'd found the solution by putting me to sleep."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've lost 10 years of my life that I'll never make up for," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This scar will never heal."
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial enters its final stages this week. Dominique Pelicot was also set to address the court before the civil parties' deliver their closing arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are then scheduled to give their closing arguments and make their sentencing demands for the defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the couple's three children spoke in court of their heartbreak and grief, with the daughter insisting she has been "forgotten" despite being also abused.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele's daughter, who uses the pen name Caroline Darian, believes she was also assaulted by her father.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case of 71-year-old Dominique Pelicot has sparked horror, protests and a debate about male violence in French society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominique Pelicot has confessed to being a rapist. If convicted, he would emerge from the historic trial with a record as one of France's worst sex offenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the co-defendants, only 14 have admitted the charges of aggravated rape, for which most of them face up to 20 years imprisonment if convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35 others deny having raped Gisele Pelicot and maintain that they thought they were taking part in sex games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele's life was shattered in 2020 when she discovered that her partner of five decades had for years been secretly administering her large doses of tranquilisers to rape her and invite dozens of strangers to join him in their home in the village of Mazan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele Pelicot has said that for years she had strange memory lapses and other health problems and thought she might have had Alzheimer's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many hope that the trial will help victims of sexual violence to finally be listened to and believed, and lead France to inscribe the notion of consent into the definition of rape in French law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One for all," French daily Liberation said on Tuesday, putting a picture of Gisele on its front page and calling the trial "historic."
  <br>
  <br>
  The verdict is expected to be delivered by December 20 at the latest. (AFP)

 The 2024 World Internet Conference, also known as the Wuzhen summit, takes place from November 19 to 22 in Zhejiang province in eastern China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech companies and government officials from around the world gather annually in one of the nation's famous historic water towns - Wuzhen - known for its rivers and canals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched in 2014, China's biggest internet forum brings together global stakeholders to discuss issues, such as tech trends, internet governance and the responsible use of technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a congratulatory note sent to the first Wuzhen Summit, President Xi Jinping said he hoped internet specialists could "improve cooperation and build a safe network", and "reach agreements on global network governance".

    This year's edition will feature 24 sub-forums on topics such as cybersecurity, digital economy, data governance and the Global Development Initiative.
    <br>
    <br>
    The summit will see the establishment of a special committee on AI, a think tank cooperation programme, and an international digital training institute.

     <br>
     Chiu told RTHK that the SAR could contribute in many ways with ongoing AI projects in universities and startups.
     <br>
     <br>
     "There are many projects ongoing and in universities, we see there are many teams
     <br>
     working on different application of AI, especially in some vertical sectors, like financial markets and on medical," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "The use of AI for enhancing the research result is also on display in many startup teams in Hong Kong."
     <br>
     <br>
     He added that the city's unique position allows it to bridge global and mainland data guidelines, potentially becoming a leader in cross-border data convergence.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We can do some trials [to test] how to deal with these data safely and usefully and comply to global standards, regulations, laws, and also fit with the mainland law. That will become a very important breakthrough in terms of doing these cross-border data examples," Chiu said.

    Thousands march in NZ Maori rights protest

<div class="itemFullText">
 Booming Indigenous Maori "haka" chants rang out across New Zealand's capital on Tuesday, as tens of thousands rallied against a conservative push to redefine the nation's founding treaty.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 35,000 demonstrators poured into the city of Wellington, police said, shutting down busy streets as their spirited procession inched its way towards parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bare-chested men draped in traditional feather cloaks were joined by horse riders waving the red, white and black Maori flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children marched alongside adults bearing distinctive full-face Maori "moko" tattoos and clutching ceremonial wooden weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The vibe is beautiful. People of all walks are here to support. It is peaceful and respectful," participant Nick Stewart told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests have been swelling throughout New Zealand after a minor party in the conservative coalition government drafted a bill to redefine the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the bill has almost no chance of passing, its mere introduction has triggered one of New Zealand's largest protests in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many critics -- including some of New Zealand's most respected lawyers -- see it as an attempt to strip long-agreed rights from the country's 900,000 strong Maori population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stand here gathered in our tens of thousands on the steps of parliament to protest this bill for our mokopuna," said Stewart, using a Maori word for future generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds gathered on the lawns outside New Zealand's beehive-shaped parliament building, playing reggae music and giving speeches that urged the government to come out and face them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not the best way to have a conversation. We will not accept unilateral change to a treaty that involves two parties," said Ngira Simmonds, a key advisor to New Zealand's Maori queen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many demonstrators arrived in Wellington after a nine-day "hikoi" -- or protest march -- that began hundreds of kilometres away at New Zealand's northern tip. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leaders from the Group of 20 major economies on Monday issued a joint statement highlighting the suffering caused by conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, while calling for cooperation on climate change, poverty reduction and tax policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  G20 leaders meeting at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum for a two-day summit tackled an agenda that reflected a shifting global order, trying to shore up multilateral consensus before US President-elect Donald Trump returns to power in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their discussions of trade, climate change and international security will run up against the sharp US policy changes that Trump vows upon taking office, from tariffs to the promise of a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, leaders at the summit were able to reach a narrow consensus on the escalating Ukraine war, focused succinctly on "human suffering" and the economic fallout of the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders' statement also expressed "deep concern about the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip," and called urgently for more aid and protection for civilians along with a comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin did not attend the summit, and Moscow was represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took marathon negotiations over the weekend for diplomats to finalise the joint statement, with debate over climate policy stretching into the dawn hours of Sunday, according to people involved in the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In their statement, leaders agreed the world needs to reach a deal by the end of the United Nations Cop29 climate change summit in Azerbaijan on a new financial goal for how much money rich nations must provide to poorer developing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cop29 officials had called on the G20 leaders for a strong signal to help breach the impasse on climate finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the joint statement said nations need to resolve the issue, they did not indicate what should be the solution at the UN summit set to end on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As host of this year's G20 meetings, Brazil expanded the group's focus on extreme poverty and hunger, while introducing debate on cooperation to fairly tax the world's wealthiest – topics also highlighted in the leaders' joint statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva opened the summit on Monday with the launch of a global alliance to combat poverty and hunger, with backing from more than 80 countries, along with multilateral banks and major philanthropies.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping also took the occasion to announce a raft of measures designed to support the developing economies of the "Global South," from scientific cooperation with Brazil and African nations to lowering trade barriers for least developed countries. (Reuters)

<img alt="President Xi Jinping says Group of 20 leaders should act to help cool the Ukraine crisis. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779796_3_20241119101708.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping urged G20 leaders on Monday to support efforts to de-escalate the war in Ukraine and reach a "political solution," state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The G20 should support the United Nations and its Security Council in playing a greater role, and support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises," Xi said, according to broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for leaders to avoid "spillovers" from battlefields and escalation of fighting, and to help "cool the Ukraine crisis and seek a political solution."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's remarks at the G20 summit in Brazil come shortly after Ukraine reportedly received a US green light to launch long-range missiles provided by Washington against targets inside Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Russia's Foreign Ministry said any use of these missiles by Ukraine to attack Russian territory would mark a radical escalation of the conflict, fundamentally alter the nature of the war and trigger "an adequate and tangible" response from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Xi also called for efforts to shore up multilateral trade systems and warned against politicising economic issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for more international governance and cooperation on AI, saying this should not become "a game of rich countries and the wealthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, the president touted China's support for the developing world and pledged more aid initiatives, including proposing an initiative with three other G20 members to help the Global South gain better access to scientific and technological innovations.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a session on the reform of global governance institutions, Xi warned against protectionism in the name of green and low-carbon development, referring to tariffs on Chinese products like electric vehicles and biodiesel imposed by G20 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve global trade governance and build a world economy characterised by openness," Xi was quoted as saying by Xinhua. (Agencies)

    Thai police station comes under siege - from monkeys

<img alt="Lopburi authorities have tried quelling instances of human-macaque clashes with sterilisation and relocation programs. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779750_1_20241118213246.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in central Thailand said they barricaded themselves into their own station over the weekend, after a menacing mob of 200 escaped monkeys ran riot.
 <br>
  <br>
  The human inhabitants of Lopburi have long suffered from a growing and aggressive monkey population and authorities have built special enclosures to contain groups of the unruly residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Saturday around 200 of the primates broke out and rampaged through town, with one posse descending on a local police station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've had to make sure doors and windows are closed to prevent them from entering the building for food," police captain Somchai Seedee said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was concerned the marauders could destroy property including police documents, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic cops and officers on guard duty were called in to fend off the visitors, the Lopburi police said on Facebook on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around a dozen of the intruders were still perched on the roof of the police station on Monday, photos from local media showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down in the streets, police and local authorities were working to round up individuals, luring them away from residential areas with food.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Thailand is an overwhelmingly Buddhist nation, it has long assimilated Hindu traditions and lore from its pre-Buddhist era.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, monkeys are afforded a special place in Thai hearts thanks to the heroic Hindu monkey god Hanuman, who helped Rama rescue his beloved wife Sita from the clutches of an evil demon king.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of the primates rule the streets around the Pra Prang Sam Yod temple in the centre of Lopburi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The town has been laying on an annual feast of fruit for its population of macaques since the late 1980s, part religious tradition and part tourist attraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their growing numbers, property damage and fights have made for an uneasy coexistence with their human neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopburi authorities have tried quelling instances of human-macaque clashes with sterilisation and relocation programs. (AFP)

<img alt="Alan Jones has been charged with a total of 26 offences against nine alleged victims. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779755_1_20241118221129.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Controversial Australian broadcaster and former Wallabies coach Alan Jones has been hit with two additional charges, after being arrested on Monday for a string of alleged historical sex crimes.
 <br>
  <br>
  A police spokesman said the veteran broadcaster was charged with an additional two counts of indecent assault relating to a ninth victim, bringing the total to 26 charges, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault against people that had been employed by Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 83-year-old is a household name across Australia and for years held immense sway through his top-rating radio talk show.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a colourful career, he also coached the national men's rugby team, was a speechwriter for an Australian prime minister, and taught at one of the country's most prestigious schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detectives from a dedicated child abuse squad arrested Jones on Monday while executing a search warrant at his luxury Sydney Harbour apartment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was later released on bail ahead of a court appearance in Sydney.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones has strenuously denied prior allegations of indecent assault which surfaced in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper late last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will allege that the accused knew some of them personally. Some of them professionally," state crime commander Michael Fitzgerald told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest victim was 17 years old at the time of the alleged offending, Fitzgerald said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wish to commend the victims and their bravery in coming forward. They are fully aware, as are the investigators, that the hard work is just beginning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Whether as a sports coach, aspiring politician or radio heavyweight, Jones has spent decades in the public eye.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rose to fame while coaching the Australian rugby side in the 1980s, leading the Wallabies to a rare "grand slam" over England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland.
  <br>
  <br>
  His feats as a coach and administrator earned him a place in Australia's sports hall of fame, where he was inducted in 1989. (Agencies)

    Kremlin warns against use of US long-range missiles

<img alt="Ukraine has long sought authorisation from Washington to use Army Tactical Missile System to hit military installations and airfields inside Russia. File photo: AFP/John Hamilton/US Department of Defence" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779746_1_20241118205717.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday accused US President Joe Biden of escalating the war in Ukraine over reports that he has allowed Kyiv to use long-range missiles supplied by Washington to strike targets inside Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments from Moscow came as Ukraine said a fresh Russian strike on the Black Sea port city of Odesa had killed at least eight people and wounded 18, following a massive weekend attack on the country's creaking energy infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has long sought authorisation from Washington to use the powerful Army Tactical Missile System, known by its initials as ATACMS, to hit military installations – and in particular airfields – inside Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine says it is mainly seeking to use the weapons to prevent Russian aerial bombardments that have levelled entire districts and towns near the front line and decimated energy facilities across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US official spoke about the policy shift on condition of anonymity on Sunday, saying the decision had come in response to Russia's deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to aid its war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps in order to continue fuelling the fire and provoke a further escalation of tensions," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If such a decision was really formulated and announced to the Kyiv regime, then of course it's a qualitatively new spiral of tensions and a qualitatively new situation from the point of view of the US's engagement in the conflict," Peskov added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said President Vladimir Putin had expressed Russia's position clearly in September when the leader said that such a move would put Nato "at war" with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said in September that if Ukraine were to attack Russia with the long-range missiles then Moscow would "take the appropriate decisions based on the threats". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies began arriving on Monday at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum for their annual summit, bracing for a shift in the global order with the return to power of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among them is President Xi Jinping, who arrived in Rio on Sunday for the summit and a state visit to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received the heads of government on a red carpet at the museum where they will meet through Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their discussions of trade, climate change and international security will run up against the sharp US policy changes that Trump vows upon taking office in January, from tariffs to the promise of a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security has been strengthened with troops reinforcing police for the duration of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi has also been meeting with G20 leaders on the sidelines of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the president said Beijing and London "should adopt a rational and objective perspective on each other's development," according to Xinhua News Agency, adding that the two countries should deepen political mutual trust to ensure the steady development of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible, and strengthened dialogue should provide stronger understanding," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first meeting between the leaders of China and the UK since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said "there is no fundamental conflict of interests between China and Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese said there had been "encouraging progress in the stabilisation of our relationship". (Reuters/Xinhua)

<img alt="Sweden took part in Nato's Steadfast Defender exercises in March 2024. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779741_1_20241118201551.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sweden on Monday began sending some five million pamphlets to residents urging them to prepare for the possibility of war, as neighbouring Finland launched a new preparedness website.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both Sweden and Finland dropped decades of military non-alignment to join the US-led military alliance Nato in the wake of Russia's 2022 assault on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of the war, Stockholm has repeatedly urged Swedes to prepare both mentally and logistically for the possibility of war, citing the serious security situation in its vicinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The booklet "If Crisis or War Comes", sent by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), contains information about how to prepare for emergencies such as war, natural disasters, or cyber-attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is an updated version of a pamphlet that Sweden has issued five times since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous version sent out in 2018 made headlines, as it was the first time it had been sent to Swedes since 1961 at the height of the Cold War.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The security situation is serious and we all need to strengthen our resilience to face various crises and ultimately war," MSB director Mikael Frisell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-page document outlines with simple illustrations the threats facing the Nordic nation, including military conflict, natural disasters, and cyber and terror attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It includes tips for preparedness, such as keeping non-perishable food in stock and storing water.
  <br>
  <br>
  MSB said the updated 2024 version had a stronger focus on preparation for war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the next two weeks 5.2 million copies will be sent to Swedish households.
  <br>
  <br>
  The brochure is available in print in both Swedish and English and digital versions are available in several other languages – including Arabic, Farsi, Ukrainian, Polish, Somali and Finnish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweden's former army chief Micael Byden alarmed many of his compatriots in January when he urged them to consider their own preparedness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Swedes have to mentally prepare for war," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Monday, the government in Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometre border with Russia, launched a website gathering information on preparedness for different crises. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least eight people were killed as super typhoon Man-yi hit the Philippine archipelago over the weekend, unleashing fierce winds and strong rains that triggered landslides and storm surges, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi, the sixth storm to hit the country in a span of one month, made landfall in the eastern province of Catanduanes on Saturday, but weakened as it moved across the main Luzon island and was later downgraded to a typhoon as it exited the landmass on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A family of seven, including an eight-year-old girl, died after a landslide in a northern provincial town in Nueva Vizcaya buried their home, the disaster office in the area said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Daet town in Camarines Norte province, a 72-year-old man was killed in a vehicular accident caused by hanging cables due to the storm's strong winds, the provincial disaster office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One casualty is one casualty too many. So, that is unfortunate," President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told reporters, referring to the death in Camarines Norte. "We will now carry on with the rescue of those isolated areas and the continuing relief for those who have been displaced."
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is approaching Vietnam with maximum sustained winds of 110km per hour and gustiness of up to 135kph.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rice-producing Nueva Ecija province in northern Luzon, farmlands and villages were flooded, worrying farmers such as Danilo Dagdagan due to the impact on crops and livelihood.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The floodwater from the typhoon and the surrounding provinces gushed here because the elevation of the land here is lower," Dagdagan said inside the living room of his flooded home. "It makes our lives difficult, it's hard for us especially for those without sufficient food."
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid has poured in to assist the Philippines in its relief operations, including from the US. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden became the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon rainforest on Sunday, flagging the dangers of global warming often dismissed by President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to scrap measures to fight climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden flew from Lima, Peru, to Manaus, Brazil, the largest city in the Amazon, to meet with local leaders working to preserve the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dressed casually in a blue shirt and pants, the 81-year-old chatted on the tarmac with local dignitaries before boarding a helicopter to fly over the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the helicopter tour, Biden saw severe erosion, ships grounded in one of the Amazon River’s main tributaries and fire damage. He also passed over a wildlife refuge for endangered species of monkeys and birds and the expansive waters where the Negro River tributary flows into the Amazon. He was joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and expert on how climate change is harming the Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden met indigenous leaders - introducing his daughter and granddaughter - and visited a museum at the gateway to the Amazon where indigenous women shook maracas as part of a welcoming ceremony. He then signed a US proclamation designating November 17 as International Conservation Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Amazon is home to indigenous communities and 10 per cent of Earth’s biodiversity. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil. Scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  During brief remarks from the forest, Biden sought to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. He said the US was on track to reach US$11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a six-fold increase from when he started his term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The fight to protect our planet is literally a fight for humanity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with President Xi Jinping. (Agencies)

    Israel hits Gaza and Lebanon in deadly strikes

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Strikes by the Israeli military killed dozens in Gaza on Sunday, the civil defence said, while also hitting a Hezbollah stronghold near Beirut's international airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel has been fighting on two fronts since September, intensifying attacks on Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah after nearly a year of cross-border clashes alongside its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  A year after the Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attacks on its south, Israel vowed to stop the Islamist militants from regrouping in the north of the Palestinian territory, launching a major assault there.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest violence in the besieged Palestinian territory, the civil defence agency said Israeli air raids killed at least 46 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadliest strike, in the middle of the night in Beit Lahia in the north, killed 26 people, including women and children, and left at least 59 others buried under the rubble, said civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strike killed 10 people in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, where a separate strike on a house claimed the life of a woman, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli drone strike killed five people in the southern city of Rafah, Bassal said, adding another strike killed three women and a child in the Nuseirat camp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry on Sunday said the overall death toll in more than 13 months of war had reached 43,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the dead are civilians, according to ministry figures, which the United Nations considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Israel's second front in the north, TV footage showed several strikes hit Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, shortly after the Israeli military warned people to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Columns of smoke were seen rising over the capital's southern suburbs, where Lebanon's only international airport is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further south, overnight Israeli air strikes and shelling hit the flashpoint town of Khiam, the Lebanese state-run National News Agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the bombardment, the Israeli army said about 20 projectiles were seen crossing from Lebanon into Israel, and that some of them were intercepted. Emergency services did not immediately report any casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has escalated its bombing of Lebanon since September 23 and has since sent in ground troops, following almost a year of limited, cross-border exchanges of fire begun by Hezbollah militants in support of Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its military on Saturday said Hezbollah had already "paid a big price," but vowed to keep fighting until tens of thousands of Israelis displaced from the north can return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces also shelled the southern area of Lebanon along the Litani River, the NNA said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news agency had earlier reported strikes on the southern city of Tyre, including in a neighbourhood near Unesco-listed ancient ruins. Israel's military said late on Saturday it had hit Hezbollah sites in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Lebanon's east, the health ministry said an Israeli strike in the Bekaa Valley killed six people including three children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hezbollah said it fired a guided missile that set an Israeli tank ablaze in the southwestern Lebanese village of Chamaa.
  <br>
  <br>
  In eastern Lebanon, funerals were held for 14 civil defence staff killed in an Israeli strike on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They weren't involved with any (armed) party... they were just waiting to answer calls for help," said Ali al-Zein, a relative of one of the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese authorities say more than 3,452 people have been killed since October last year, with most casualties recorded since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced the death of a soldier in southern Lebanon, bringing to 48 the number killed fighting Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN-backed assessment on November 9 warned famine was imminent in northern Gaza, amid the increased hostilities and a near-halt in food aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has pushed back against a Human Rights Watch report this week alleging that its mass displacement of Gazans amounts to a "crime against humanity," as well as findings from a UN Special Committee pointing to warfare practices "consistent with the characteristics of genocide."
  <br>
  <br>
  A foreign ministry spokesman dismissed the HRW report as "completely false", while the United States – Israel's main military supplier – said accusations of genocide "are certainly unfounded."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, police said they arrested three suspects after flares shot near the home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the central city of Caesarea, south of Haifa, while he was away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators in Tel Aviv on Saturday reiterated demands that the government reach a deal to free dozens of hostages still held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protest came a week after mediator Qatar suspended its role until Hamas and Israel show "seriousness" in truce and hostage-release talks. (AFP)

    Russia pounds Ukraine with 'massive' attack

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday pummelled Ukraine with a "massive" aerial barrage of missiles and drones, killing at least nine people across the country in the largest attack in months that Kyiv called "hellish."
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow launched 120 missiles and almost 100 drones, targeting Kyiv as well as southern, central and far-western corners of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civilians were killed in the Mykolaiv, Lviv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A hellish night," the spokesman for Ukraine's airforce Yuriy Ignat said on social media, saying Kyiv downed "144 targets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes caused massive power cuts across the country, with fears of a precarious winter to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Kyiv called it one of the biggest attacks in the almost three-year-long Russian assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A massive attack on our country," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past week, the aggressor used nearly 140 missiles of various types, more than 900 guided aerial bombs, and over 600 strike drones," he said, accusing Moscow of trying to "intimidate us with cold and blackouts."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came just two days after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the first time in almost two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is war criminal Putin's true response to all those who called and visited him recently," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said after the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need peace through strength, not appeasement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv had slammed Scholz for calling Putin, as have many in Germany itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Sunday, Scholz reaffirmed his country's support for Ukraine, saying that no decision on ending the war would be taken without Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine can count on us" and "no decision will be taken behind Ukraine's back," the chancellor said at Berlin airport before flying off to a G20 meeting in Rio de Janeiro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has been on the back foot militarily in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow's forces have made steady advances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The election of Donald Trump in the US has raised questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican blazingly critical of US aid to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses heard explosions in the early morning in Kyiv and lose to Sloviansk in the Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow, meanwhile, said it had hit all its targets, claiming it had targeted an "essential energy infrastructure supporting the Ukrainian military-industrial complex."
  <br>
  <br>
  But civilian deaths were reported across Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Kherson said a 51-year-old woman was killed by a drone.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the southern Mykolaiv region, local leader Vitaliy Kim said two women were killed in a night attack and that seven people – including two children – were wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll included two employees of the state railway company Ukrzaliznytsia in the city of Nikopol, who were killed when a depot was hit, the Dnipropetrovsk region's governor Sergiy Lysak and the operator said. Three more people were wounded in the bombing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people were also killed in the Odesa region, where a teenager was wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian drones also made their way to Zakarpattia – a mountainous region rarely hit – with officials saying fragments fell in the village of Pavshyno, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytsky, said a 66-year-old woman was killed in her car in the village of Sheptytsky – some 20 kilometres from the Polish border.
  <br>
  <br>
  That prompted Nato-member Poland to scramble fighter jets and mobilise all available forces on Sunday in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warsaw puts its armed forces on alert whenever attacks against its neighbouring country are deemed likely to create a danger for its own territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia, meanwhile, said a man was killed by a Ukrainian drone in its border Belgorod region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's energy operator DTEK on Sunday announced emergency power cuts in the Kyiv region and two regions in the east.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's relentless aerial bombardment has destroyed half of Ukraine's energy production capacity, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said on Telegram that Russian forces were "attacking electricity generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the harsh Ukrainian winter fast approaching, the country is already suffering from major energy shortfalls, while its outmanned and outgunned forces have been steadily ceding ground to the Kremlin's troops for weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv has implored its Western allies for help to rebuild its energy grid – a hugely expensive undertaking – and to supply its outgunned forces with more aerial defence weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But many in Ukraine fear that Western help will not be as freely given following the imminent return of Trump to the White House in January. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 31st edition of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Week has wrapped up with host nation Peru saying it has furthered three objectives, including fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders also issued a joint declaration, calling for a concerted effort in tackling issues such as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to local and international press at the end of the week-long Apec meeting, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte said she was honoured to have hosted the leaders of the bloc’s 20 other economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also praised the professional work of her colleagues for the past year, saying it has reaped immense rewards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those included the signing of a free trade agreement with Hong Kong, and updating the existing one with China, its biggest trading partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boluarte also reiterated three thematic priorities - trade and investment for inclusive and interconnected growth; innovation and digitalisation to promote transition to a formal economy; and sustainable growth for resilient development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before making her concluding remarks, the Peruvian leader and her counterparts got together one final time for the family photo, a longstanding tradition for the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session offers a chance for the host nation to showcase their traditional attire, but Peru decided to use the occasion to promote their textile products made of alpaca fibre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each leader was given a vicuna wool scarf from a local luxury brand. The price tag? US$1,415.
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours after the summit concluded, the customary Leaders’ Declaration was released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goals were similar to those in past years, including tackling climate change, reforming the World Trade Organisation, and achieving food and energy security.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A drunk man on Sunday was killed by French police outside Paris after threatening officers and shouting "Allahu akbar," an Arabic expression often shouted by Islamist attackers.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to preliminary information, the man brandished what turned out to be a dummy gun, a source close to the case said. He was "very drunk," the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At around 6.00 am (0500 GMT), police were called to an incident which saw an armed man bang on a door in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, one of the police sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man threatened the police "by pointing a handgun and shouting 'Allahu akbar'," a Muslim expression of faith meaning "God is greatest," the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police officer then drew his weapon and shot the man, who died despite the intervention of the emergency services, the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to another police source, the officer fired his weapon three times, and the man was hit once. The entire incident was captured by the police body camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, aged 30, committed an "apology for terrorism" in 2019, according to police sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case has been referred to the police's IGPN internal affairs department, which is a standard procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police officer who shot the man tested negative for drugs and alcohol. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Super Typhoon Man-yi slammed into the Philippines' most populous island on Sunday, with the national weather service warning of flooding, landslides and huge waves as the storm sweeps across the archipelago nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi was still packing maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour after making its first landfall late on Saturday on lightly populated Catanduanes island.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1.2 million people fled their homes ahead of Man-yi as the weather forecaster warned of a "life-threatening" impact from the powerful storm, which follows an unusual streak of violent weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi uprooted trees, brought down power lines and smashed flimsy houses to pieces after hitting Catanduanes in the typhoon-prone Bicol region.
  <br>
  <br>
  No deaths have been reported, but there was "extensive" damage to structures on Catanduanes, civil defence chief Ariel Nepomuceno said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi remained a super typhoon as it hit heavily populated Luzon – the country's economic engine – forecasters said, warning of a "potentially dangerous" situation in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significant weakening" was expected as it traversed the mountainous island, the weather service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it said severe flooding and landslides were expected as Man-yi dumped "intense to torrential" rain over provinces in its path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters also warned storm surges of up to more than three metres could swamp vulnerable coastal communities, including in Manila.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panganiban municipality in the northeast of Catanduanes took a direct hit from Man-yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photos and a drone video shared on the Facebook page of Mayor Cesar Robles showed fallen power lines, damaged and destroyed buildings, and trees and corrugated iron sheets strewn on the roads.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pepito was so strong, I have never experienced a typhoon this strong," Robles said in a post, using the local name for Man-yi, as clean-up efforts got underway and people returned home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is still a bit unsafe, there are still bursts of wind and there is much debris."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mother-of-three Marissa Cueva Alejandro, 36, who grew up in Catanduanes and sheltered with a relative during Man-yi, said typhoons were getting stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before, we would only experience (typhoon) signal number three to four, but now typhoons are getting as strong as signal number five," she said, referring to the weather service's five-tiered wind warning system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is the sixth storm in the past month to batter the archipelago nation. At least 163 people died in the previous storms, that also left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather forecaster has hoisted its highest and second-highest typhoon signals over a wide band of provinces stretching from Luzon's east coast, where Man-yi made its second landfall, across to the western side of the island where it will exit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,000 people were in emergency evacuation shelters in Dipaculao municipality in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others have stayed home to protect their property and livestock, or because they were sceptical of the warnings, said Geofry Parrocha, communications officer of Dipaculao disaster agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of our countrymen are really hard-headed. They do not believe us until the typhoon arrives," Parrocha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists emptied out of coastal resorts ahead of the typhoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our facilities are deserted," said Irene Padeo, reservation officer of the L'Sirene Boutique Resort in Baler town in Aurora, as Man-yi neared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our outdoor items have all been packed and taken indoors. We tied down all the rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  On its current trajectory, Man-yi will cross north of Manila and sweep over the South China Sea on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season – most cyclones develop between July and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency said was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951. (AFP)

    Iran 'categorically' denies envoy's meeting with Musk

<img alt="The New York Times has reported that Elon Musk met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779495_1_20241116195555.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's foreign ministry spokesman on Saturday "categorically" denied The New York Times report on Tehran's ambassador to the United Nations meeting with US tech billionaire Elon Musk, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with state news agency IRNA, spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was reported as "categorically denying such a meeting" and expressing "surprise at the coverage of the American media in this regard."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Times reported on Friday that Musk, who is a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani.
  <br>
  <br>
  It cited anonymous Iranian sources describing the encounter as "positive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian newspapers, particularly those aligned with the reformist party that supports President Masoud Pezeshkian, largely described the meeting in positive terms before Baghaei's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the weeks leading up to Trump's re-election, Iranian officials have signalled a willingness to resolve issues with the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the US-backed shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, both countries have communicated through the Swiss embassy in Tehran and the Sultanate of Oman. (AFP)

<img alt="Protesters burned tyres, set cars ablaze and blocked roads in Manipur's capital city of Imphal on Saturday. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779506_1_20241116213403.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian state riven by months of ethnic tensions imposed an internet shutdown and curfew on Saturday after angry protests over the recovery of six bodies of people believed to have been kidnapped by insurgents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manipur in India's northeast has been rocked by periodic clashes for more than 18 months between the predominantly Hindu Meitei majority and the mainly Christian Kuki community, dividing the state into ethnic enclaves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies were suspected to be of those belonging to the Meitei community who went missing in Jiribam district after a gunfight between Kuki insurgents and Manipur police last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three bodies were pulled from a river in Jiribam on Friday while three more were found on Saturday, local media reports said.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the discovery provoked incensed mobs to attack the homes of seven local politicians, but only minor damage had been recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters also burned tyres and blocked roads in the capital city of Imphal on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Manipur government announced a curfew was in effect in part of the city due to the "developing law and order situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The state's home ministry also ordered all internet and mobile data services in Manipur to be shut off for two days in order to bring the latest unrest under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anti-social elements might use social media extensively for transmission of images, hate speech and hate video messages inciting the passions of the public which might have serious repercussions for the law and order situation," a notice said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Internet services were shut down for months in Manipur last year during an outbreak of violence which displaced around 60,000 people from their homes, according to government figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of the state's residents are living in emergency shelters, still unable to return home due to ongoing tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long-standing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities revolve around competition for land and public jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights activists have accused local leaders of exacerbating ethnic divisions for political gain. (AFP)

 The guitar described by Noel Gallagher as "the best in the world," which he played on the third Oasis album "Be Here Now," sold at auction on Saturday for £226,800 (US$286,000).
 <br>
  <br>
  The custom Silver Sparkle Gibson Les Paul Florentine guitar that starred on the 1997 album was one of Gallagher's primary guitars during the height of Oasis's fame.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was made for him at Gibson's custom shop and appeared in performances on The David Letterman Show and Saturday Night Live.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not one of the best guitars. It's the best guitar," Gallagher said of the instrument in a 1997 interview with Spin magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guitar was sold in a sale of entertainment memorabilia by online auction group Propstore. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Militants stormed a paramilitary checkpoint in southwestern Pakistan on Saturday, killing seven troops, the latest in a string of attacks by separatist insurgents, police said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The early-morning attack in the mountainous Kalat district, some 150 km south of Quetta, capital of the southwestern Balochistan province, continued for several hours, said police officer Habib-ur-Rehman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 18 wounded paramilitary soldiers, some in critical condition, were admitted to local hospitals, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed that its fighters had attacked the checkpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has stepped up its operations recently, claiming a suicide bombing last week that targeted Pakistani army troops at a railway station minutes before they were due to board a train to return home for vacations. It killed 27, including 19 soldiers, who were in civilian clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BLA and several other militant groups have been fighting for decades for a separate homeland to gain a greater share of the mineral and resource-rich Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he would like to end the war with Russia next year through "diplomatic means."
 <br>
  <br>
  He spoke a day after saying he expected the conflict to end sooner than it would otherwise have done, once Donald Trump takes office in the United States next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For our part, we must do everything we can to ensure that this war ends next year. We have to end it by diplomatic means," Zelensky said in an interview with Ukrainian radio. "And this, I think, is very important."
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been no meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine, but a Trump presidency raises questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican repeatedly saying he would end the war swiftly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to understand what the Russians want," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referring to Ukraine, he said: "You are at war with a state that does not value its people, that has a lot of equipment, that does not care how many people die."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will only accept talks with Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders Ukrainian territory that Moscow occupies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said he repeated that demand in a phone conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has rejected Putin's conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has made steady advances in eastern Ukraine since this summer, inching closer to key hubs such as Pokrovsk and Kurakhove.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said on Saturday that Russian forces were suffering heavy losses and that the adance had "slowed down" in some areas. (AFP)

    Trump pick Hegseth accused of 2017 sexual assault

<img alt="Donald Trump's choice for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, was not charged over the allegation. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779487_1_20241116182956.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Donald Trump's most controversial cabinet picks just became even more so: Pete Hegseth, tapped for defence secretary earlier this week, was accused of sexual assault in 2017, according to police.
 <br>
  <br>
  No charges were filed in the case, but shocked Trump transition team officials are nonetheless reportedly weighing the next steps for the Fox News host, whose nomination took many in Washington by surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Trump nominated the 44-year-old National Guard veteran on Tuesday to run the world's most powerful military, despite having never managed a large organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in Monterey, California confirmed on Thursday that they had investigated "an alleged sexual assault" at a hotel involving Hegseth that included bruising to the victim's right thigh, in early October 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the woman's accusations caught the Trump team off guard, according to Vanity Fair, which first reported the story.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's lawyer Timothy Parlatore told the publication that the allegation "was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said that Hegseth "has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defence so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's hearing in the Senate is likely to be among the more fraught, not only due to his lack of experience but also other controversies, such as his lobbying of Trump during his first term to pardon service members accused of war crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014 and now co-hosts "Fox and Friends Weekend" and serves as a host for "Fox Nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  He additionally served as an infantry officer in the National Guard, deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accusations against Hegseth come as Trump's pick for attorney general, far-right former congressman Matt Gaetz, stunned many following his lengthy embroilment in sexual misconduct allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump himself was convicted of financial wrongdoing for covering up payments to a former porn star and found liable for defaming and sexually abusing an author.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth has been married three times, divorcing his first wife in 2009 following an "irretrievable breakdown" and "infidelity," according to the Washington Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  His second wife filed for divorce in September 2017, one month after he had a baby with a Fox News producer whom he subsequently married, according to US media. (AFP)

 The UN's climate chief urged G20 nations on Saturday to push COP29 negotiations towards a deal to raise money for developing nations, warning there was a "long way to go."
 <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators worked through the night to narrow their differences at the UN talks in Baku before ministers arrive next week for the final days of the summit, but major differences remain.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN climate chief Simon Stiell appealed for leaders of the Group of 20 nations, which includes the world's biggest economies and top polluters, to weigh in when they meet in Brazil on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As G20 Leaders head to Rio de Janeiro, the world is watching and expecting strong signals that climate action is core business for the world's biggest economies," Stiell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some developing countries, which are least responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions, want an annual commitment of US$1.3 trillion to help them adapt to climate impact and transition to clean energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is over 10 times what donors including the United States, the European Union and Japan currently pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the negotiations are stuck over a final figure, the type of financing and who should pay, with developed countries wanting China and wealthy Gulf states to join the list of donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest draft deal was 25 pages long, and still contained a raft of options.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here in Baku negotiators are working around the clock on a new climate finance goal," Stiell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a long way to go, but everyone is very aware of the stakes, at the halfway point in the COP," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Climate finance progress outside of our process is equally crucial, and the G20's role is mission-critical." (AFP)

    Philippines braces for impact of Super Typhoon Man-yi

<img alt="Man-yi will be the sixth major storm to batter the Philippines in the past month. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779477_1_20241116162508.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A super typhoon sweeping towards the Philippines on Saturday was intensifying and could have a "potentially catastrophic" impact, the state weather forecaster warned, with millions of people at risk from storm surges.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 650,000 people have fled their homes ahead of Super Typhoon Man-yi, which is expected to make landfall later on Saturday or early on Sunday, becoming the sixth major storm to pummel the archipelago nation in the past month.
  <br>
  <br>
  With wind gusts of up to 240 kilometres per hour, Man-yi was on track to slam into the sparsely populated island province of Catanduanes as a super typhoon or "near peak intensity", the weather service warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially catastrophic and life-threatening situation looms for northeastern Bicol region as Super Typhoon 'Pepito' further intensifies," the forecaster said in its latest update, using the local name for the storm and referring to the southern part of the main island of Luzon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to 14-metre high seas were expected around Catanduanes, while more than 7.6 million people were at risk from storm surges of one to three metres, the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 163 people died in the five storms that pounded the Philippines in recent weeks that also left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government urged people on Saturday to heed warnings to flee to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If preemptive evacuation is required, let us do so and not wait for the hour of peril before evacuating or seeking help, because if we did that we would be putting in danger not only our lives but also those of our rescuers," Interior Undersecretary Marlo Iringan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Albay province, Legazpi City grocer Myrna Perea was sheltering with her fruit vendor husband and their three children in a school classroom with nine other families after they were ordered to leave their shanty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conditions were hot and cramped – the family spent Friday night sleeping together on a mat under the classroom's single ceiling fan – but Perea said it was better to be safe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think our house will be wrecked when we get back because it's made of light materials – just two gusts are required to knock it down," said Perea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why we evacuated. Even if the house is destroyed, the important thing is we do not lose a family member."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists have warned climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuation centres were filling up on Catanduanes island in the typhoon-prone Bicol region, with the weather forecaster warning of "widespread incidents of severe flooding and landslides."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 400 people were squeezed into the provincial government building in the capital Virac, with new arrivals being sent to a gymnasium, said provincial disaster officer Roberto Monterola.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monterola said he had dispatched soldiers to force about 100 households in two coastal villages near Virac to move inland due to fears storm surges could swamp their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regardless of the exact landfall point, heavy rainfall, severe winds, and storm surges may occur in areas outside the predicted landfall zone," the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Naga city in Camarines Sur province imposed a curfew from midday on Saturday in a bid to force residents indoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Northern Samar province, disaster officer Rei Josiah Echano lamented that damage caused by typhoons was the root cause of poverty in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whenever there's a typhoon like this, it brings us back to the mediaeval era, we go (back) to square one," Echano said, as the province prepared for the onslaught of Man-yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  All vessels – from fishing boats to oil tankers – have been ordered to stay in port or return to shore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 4,000 people were stranded after the coast guard shut 55 ports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcanology agency also warned heavy rain dumped by Man-yi could trigger flows of volcanic sediment, or lahars, from three volcanos, including Taal, south of Manila.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi will hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season – most cyclones develop between July and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency said on Saturday was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951. (AFP)

    10 newborns killed, 16 critical in India hospital fire

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire at the neonatal unit of an Indian hospital killed 10 newborns, authorities said on Saturday, with another 16 clinging to life after a blaze blamed on a faulty oxygen machine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Building fires are common in India due to shoddy construction and a routine disregard for safety regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday night's fire broke out at about 10:30 pm (1700 GMT) at the Maharani Lakshmibai Medical College in Jhansi, around 450 kilometres south of the capital New Delhi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage from the scene showed charred beds and walls inside the ward as a crowd of anguished families waited outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Babies rescued from the fire, all only days old, were laid side by side on a bed elsewhere in the hospital as staff hooked up their arms to intravenous drips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten infants have sadly died," Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seven bodies have been identified. Three bodies haven't been identified as yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 16 infants were in critical condition after the blaze, news outlet Times Now reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pathak said a safety audit of the hospital was carried out in February followed by a fire drill three months later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of the fire will be probed," he added. "If any lapses are found, strict action will be taken against those responsible and no one will be spared."
  <br>
  <br>
  District official Avinash Kumar said the fire had been caused by an electrical short circuit in the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are providing medical care to the critically injured," he was quoted as saying by the Hindustan Times newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reports quoted other officials who said the fire started in a piece of machinery used to enrich the level of oxygen in the atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The high concentration of the combustible gas in the unit helped the fire spread quickly and suddenly, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster NDTV reported that 54 infants in total were in the neonatal intensive care unit when the fire broke out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the deaths "heart-wrenching" in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My deepest condolences to those who have lost their innocent children in this. I pray to God to give them the strength to bear this immense loss," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced compensation of 500,000 rupees (US$5,900) to bereaved families.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The district administration and concerned officials have been instructed to carry out relief and rescue operations on a war footing," Adityanath wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I pray to Lord Shri Ram to provide salvation to the departed souls and speedy recovery to the injured."
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's fire comes six months after a similar blaze at a children's hospital in New Delhi that killed six newborns. (AFP)

 Chief Executive John Lee had his most hectic day yet in his week-long visit of Peru, signing a free trade agreement with the nation and meeting with the leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also attended an informal dialogue on Friday, Lima time, briefing regional leaders on the SAR’s strengths as well as its role in China’s Belt and Road initiative and Apec development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong leader then met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for the first time since July last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked Anwar for supporting the SAR’s plan to establish an Economic and Trade Office in Kuala Lumpur, the fourth in the region known as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also congratulated Malaysia for taking the chairmanship of Asean next year, and hoped the nation will continue to support Hong Kong's early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or Rcep.
  <br>
  <br>
  After attending another Apec dialogue where he exchanged views Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Lee had two more bilateral meeting with Vietnamese President Luong Cuong and Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries are key trading partners of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader’s day culminated in the signing of the FTA between Hong Kong and Peru, and he got to relax by watching cultural performances at an Apec gala dinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Lima time, Lee will attend the Apec Economic Leaders' meeting retreat and meet with Peruvian business sector representatives.

<img alt='President Xi Jinping has told his Japanese counterpart, Shigeru Ishiba, Beijing is ready to work with Tokyo  "in accordance with the principles and directions set out in the four political documents" between the two countries. Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779446_1_20241116120529.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping told Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in their first meeting that China hoped Japan would "properly handle" major issues such as history and Taiwan, according to state media on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi called for the two Asian neighbours to safeguard the global free trade system, as well as stable and unimpeded production and supply chains, as they met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum summit in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that China is ready to work with Japan "in accordance with the principles and directions set out in the four political documents" between the two countries, and adhere to the important consensus that they are "cooperative partners rather than threats to each other", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Japan are close neighbours and important countries in Asia and the world, Xi said, adding that bilateral relations bears significance beyond bilateral dimension.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba told Xi that Japan's position on the Taiwan question, based on the Japan-China joint communique in 1972, remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese prime minister also said he wanted to build a "constructive and stable" relationship, and that Tokyo has no intention of decoupling from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a summit for the first time in two years on the sidelines of Apec.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi told Yoon that "the international and regional situations have undergone many changes" over the past two years, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how the situation changes, China and South Korea should stick to the original intention in establishing diplomatic ties, firmly adhere to the direction of good-neighbourliness and friendship, and remain committed to the goal of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon told his Chinese counterpart that their two countries should cooperate for peace in the face of North Korea and Russia's military cooperation, according to the South Korean President's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon expressed his hope that "South Korea and China will cooperate in promoting stability and peace in the region in response to North Korea's successive provocations, the war in Ukraine, and Russia-North Korea military cooperation", his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also called for the two countries to further strengthen cooperation in the economic sector, which he called "the central axis of bilateral relations over the past 30 years", Yoon's office said. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has warned that the world is entering an era of harmful "protectionism", in remarks to an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of what will be his final official face-to-face with outgoing US President Joe Biden, Xi raised concern about "spreading unilateralism and protectionism", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also quoted Xi as cautioning against "fragmentation of the world economy" in a written speech prepared for a meeting of CEOs on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi and Biden are in the Peruvian capital for a two-day meeting of heads of state of the 21-member Apec grouping.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the sitting leaders of the world's two largest economies will have their final official encounter before Trump takes office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his prepared remarks reported by Xinhua, Xi said the world had "entered a new period of turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said attempts to use pretexts to block economic cooperation and to break up the interdependence of the world were nothing but back-pedalling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should see to it that economic globalisation generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the principles of "plan together, build together and benefit together" should be followed, the representation and voice of the Global South should be enhanced continuously, and all countries should be ensured of equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules in conducting international economic cooperation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Hamas official said on Friday that the group is "ready for a ceasefire" in Gaza and urged US President-elect Donald Trump to pressure Israel to end the war.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas is ready to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip if a ceasefire proposal is presented and on the condition that it is respected" by Israel, said Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We call on the US administration and Trump to pressure the Israeli government to end the aggression.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas informed the mediators that it is in favour of any proposal submitted to it that would lead to a definitive ceasefire and military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, allowing the return of displaced people, a serious deal for a prisoner exchange, the entry of humanitarian aid and reconstruction," Naim added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demands are the same ones Hamas has made in successive rounds of ceasefire negotiations since the start of the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign trail, Trump promised peace in the Middle East and has vowed to give freer rein to Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naim's comments come after Qatar said on Saturday that it had suspended its role as a key mediator for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal until Hamas and Israel show "seriousness" in talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gulf emirate, which has hosted Hamas's political leadership since 2012 with US blessing, has been involved in months of protracted diplomacy aimed at ending the war triggered by the Palestinian group's attack on Israel on October 7 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,764 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

    Spanish regional leader admits 'mistakes' over floods

<img alt="Carlos Mazon admits he was having lunch on the afternoon of the disaster. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779377_1_20241115203421.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Spain's eastern Valencia region admitted on Friday to "mistakes" in handling the country's deadliest floods in decades that killed 216 people there and apologised.
 <br>
  <br>
  The October 29 disaster claimed 224 lives nationwide. The floods wrecked infrastructure, gutted buildings and submerged fields.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final bill is expected to soar to tens of billions of euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to deny mistakes," Carlos Mazon told Valencia's regional parliament, adding he was "not going to shirk any responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  As the head of the regional government "I would like to apologise" to those who "felt" that "the aid did not arrive or was not enough," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he spoke, dozens of protesters gathered outside the building, jeering and chanting slogans demanding his resignation and calling him a liar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost half the people killed in Valencia were 70 years old or older and 26 were foreigners, including two Britons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outrage at the authorities for their perceived mismanagement before and after the floods triggered mass protests on Saturday, the largest in Valencia city which drew 130,000 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several carried placards that read: "Our hands are stained with mud, theirs with blood."
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics have questioned the efficiency of the Valencia region's alert system. In some cases, residents were only contacted by telephone when floodwater was already gushing through towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergency alert was only sent after 8 pm, nearly 13 hours after the state weather agency warned of the risk of "very intense" rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of Valencia's emergency department admitted she did not learn it was possible to send such warnings until the evening of the first day of the floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Spain's decentralised system of government, regional governments lead disaster response.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's Socialist-led central government has said Mazon's administration, run by the conservative Popular Party (PP), bore responsibility for not issuing the alert earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mazon has also come under fire for having been missing for several critical hours on the afternoon of the disaster when it was already raining heavily.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to repeated questions for explanations for his absence, he finally admitted he had been having lunch with a journalist to offer her the directorship of the regional television station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many residents have complained they were left without food and water for days and had to rely on aid provided by volunteers instead of the government. (AFP)

    COP29 summit denounced as 'no longer fit for purpose'

<img alt="A coalition of NGOs says more than 1,700 people linked to fossil fuel interests are attending COP29. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779379_1_20241115205149.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oil executives and lobbyists descended on COP29 in Baku for "energy day" on Friday, as environmental groups denounced the presence of the fossil fuel industry at the UN climate talks.
 <br>
  <br>
  While negotiators haggled over the key goal of an increase in climate funding, a former UN chief denounced the talks as "no longer fit for purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of France's TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, said the sector is "part of the problem," but insisted it was making "continuous progress" on transition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Kick the Big Polluters Out" (KBPO) coalition of NGOs analysed accreditations at the annual climate confab, calculating that more than 1,700 people linked to fossil fuel interests are in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fossil fuel industry is creating havoc in people's lives, the fossil fuel industry is responsible for destruction," said Makoma Lekalakala, a South African environmental campaigner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The presence of oil, gas and coal interests at the climate talks has long been a source of controversy, and the appointment of UAE state oil firm head Sultan Al Jaber to head last year's negotiations in Dubai stoked criticism.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's host is energy-rich Azerbaijan, whose President Ilham Aliyev on Tuesday repeated his insistence that oil and gas are a "gift of God."
  <br>
  <br>
  Former US vice president and climate activist Al Gore warned on Thursday that "the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Dubai summit produced a global agreement on "transitioning away" from fossil fuels, the follow-up commitment "has been very weak" and the issue "is hardly even mentioned" at COP29, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to think that one of the reasons for that is that the petrostates have too much control over the process."
  <br>
  <br>
  A group of leading climate activists and scientists including former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned on Friday that the COP process was "no longer fit for purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  They urged smaller, more frequent meetings, strict criteria for host countries and rules to ensure companies showed clear climate commitments before being allowed to send lobbyists to the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michai Robertson, lead negotiator on climate change for the Alliance of Small Island States, said the talks remained crucial for vulnerable nations shut out of forums like the G20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is the only time that our voice can be clearly heard," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  KBPO said Japan brought employees of coal giant Sumitomo as part of its delegation, Canada included oil producers Suncor and Tourmaline and Italy brought employees of energy giants Eni and Enel.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, some of those on the NGO list work for companies that are not primarily fossil fuel-related, including Danish offshore wind champion Orsted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top priority at the talks is a new figure for climate finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change and transition their economies away from fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rich nations are reluctant to spend much more than the US$100 billion a year already committed, conscious of domestic publics angry about inflation and stuttering economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But developing countries warn they need at least US$1 trillion to defend against the ravages of climate change and meet commitments to reach net-zero emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators are struggling to agree on a workable draft text before ministers arrive next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must be honest, we believe that the pace of their work is currently too slow," warned COP29 lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev on Friday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hanging over proceedings is the question of what role the United States will play on climate action and funding after Donald Trump returns to the White House in January, given his pledge to again withdraw from the landmark Paris agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  American officials at the talks have insisted Trump will struggle to undo the climate action already in motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When history is written, he will be looked at as a speed bump on the tremendous growth of this clean energy transition," the Democratic governor of Washington state, Jay Inslee, told an event on Friday. (AFP)

<img alt="Punjab's environment minister has urged residents to " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779387_1_20241115215108.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan's most populated province of Punjab on Friday extended school closures in smog-hit major cities by a week, as the country battles record air pollution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The schools will remain closed for another week due to the hazardous air quality. Institutes including universities would switch to online classes to ensure the safety of students," Marriyum Aurangzeb, Punjab's environment minister, told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Air quality in Lahore was deemed "hazardous," according to data from IQAir, with the concentration of deadly PM2.5 pollutants – fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health – around 30 times the level deemed acceptable by the World Health Organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 35,000 patients have been reported in the hospitals of Lahore due to smog-related health issues in almost a month," Aurangzeb added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also urged residents to "stop roaming around on bikes and in cars and to wear masks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The province, home to more than half of Pakistan's 240 million people, had previously closed all schools until November 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  A mix of low-grade fuel emissions from factories and vehicles, exacerbated by agricultural burning, blanket the city each winter, trapped by cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN's food agency says transport is the main cause of air pollution in Pakistan, followed by industry and agriculture.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children are often hardest hit, with Unicef noting that "prior to these record-breaking levels of air pollution, about 12 percent of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were due to air pollution." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A collection of guitars and other musical equipment owned by influential rock guitarist Jeff Beck will go on sale in London in January, Christie's auctioneers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the 130 guitars, amps and "tools of the trade" used by Beck during his decades-spanning career are expected to fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds (dollars) when they go under the hammer on January 22, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include the rock legend's 1954 "Oxblood" Gibson Les Paul, famously depicted on the cover of his seminal 1975 solo instrumental album "Blow By Blow" and used on several tracks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is estimated to fetch up to £500,000 (US$634,000).
  <br>
  <br>
  Beck, who rose to stardom with 1960s supergroup The Yardbirds and later enjoyed a prolific solo career, died in January last year aged 78.
  <br>
  <br>
  His widow, Sandra Beck, said it was "a massive wrench" to part with the instruments but that they needed to be "shared, played and loved again."
  <br>
  <br>
  "These guitars were his great love and after almost two years of his passing, it's time to part with them as Jeff wished," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the future guitarists who acquire these items are able to move closer to the genius who played them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The collection includes another Gibson Les Paul from 1958, dubbed the original "Yardburst" as it was bought in 1966 while Beck was in the seminal British rock group. It is valued at up to £60,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Fender Telecaster and Gibson hybrid crafted by world-renowned guitar designer Seymour Duncan specifically for Beck in 1973 is predicted to sell for as much as £150,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Highlights from the guitar haul will be on public view in Los Angeles on December 4-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The full collection will go on show for a week at Christie's London headquarters before the January 22 sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie's Amelia Walker said the auctioneers were "honoured to have been entrusted" with the sale of instruments belonging to a "rock pioneer whose influence on his peers was unmatched."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added Beck's guitars had "shared his emotion and voice" with the world and the auction would "pay tribute to his enduring legacy." (AFP)

    Landslide win for Sri Lanka president's coalition

<img alt="Anura Kumara Dissanayake's leftist coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779382_1_20241115211555.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake thanked voters on Friday for delivering his leftist coalition a landslide victory in snap parliamentary elections that repudiated establishment parties blamed for triggering an economic crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake, a self-avowed Marxist, swept September presidential elections on a promise to combat graft and recover stolen assets, two years after a slow-motion financial crash imposed widespread hardships on the island nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  His decision to immediately call polls and secure parliamentary backing for his agenda was vindicated on Friday, with his National People's Power (NPP) coalition taking at least 159 seats in the 225-member assembly – exceeding a two-thirds majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to all who voted for a renaissance," Dissanayake said in a brief statement on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coalition had a monumental 61.5 percent of the vote while opposition leader Sajith Premadasa's party was well behind with only 17.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People voted to get rid of corruption and a corrupt system," said IT professional Chanaka Rajapaksha, who supported the NPP in the polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a sign of the magnitude of support for Dissanayake, his party won the most votes in the northern district of Jaffna, dominated by the island's minority Tamil community, for the first time since independence from Britain in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voter turnout was estimated at under 70 percent, less than the 80 percent of eligible voters who cast a ballot in September's presidential polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake, the 55-year-old son of a labourer, had been an MP for nearly 25 years and was briefly an agriculture minister but his NPP coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stormed to the presidency after successfully distancing himself from successive leaders blamed for steering the country to its 2022 economic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial crash was the worst in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka's history as an independent nation, sparking months-long shortages of food, fuel and essential medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The resulting public anger culminated in the storming of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's compound, prompting his resignation and temporary exile.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake's pledge to change a "corrupt" political culture has resonated with millions of Sri Lankans struggling to make ends meet following tax hikes and other austerity measures imposed to repair the nation's finances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very happy about this victory," said voter Nilusha Nilmini after the scale of the win became clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All this time, the country was governed by thieves, robbers and corrupt people. I am very happy that the crooks are out and a clean government has been established."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake's JVP party, the main constituent in the NPP coalition, led two insurrections in 1971 and 1987 that resulted in at least 80,000 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he was sworn in after presidential polls described as one of the island nation's most peaceful elections. (AFP)

 US President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday that he had selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist who has spread misinformation on vaccines, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the top health agency in the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a post on X, Kennedy vowed to work to end chronic diseases, clean up corruption and provide Americans with the data they needed to make informed decisions, vowing to Trump that he would work to "Make America Healthy Again”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy ran for president in this year's election as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump, in exchange for a role in the Republican's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country," Trump said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appointment, which had been seen as a possibility for weeks, raised concern among some public health advocates who said Kennedy could have a negative role in Americans' health given his power over public health agencies. The Democratic Party decried the decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some politicians and business groups supported the nomination, such as the National Community Pharmacists Association, which said it was encouraged by his willingness to take on corporations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among Kennedy's suggestions is that he would gut the 18,000-employee Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – which ensures the safety of food, drugs and medical devices – and replace hundreds of employees at the National Institutes of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "FDA's war on public health is about to end," he wrote on X in late October, adding that includes its "aggressive suppression" of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, sunshine and other items.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1. Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of vaccine makers, including Pfizer and Moderna, fell after news of Kennedy's appointment and were down in after-hours trading by as much as two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy has been criticised for making false medical claims, including that vaccines are linked to autism. He opposed state and federal restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic and was accused of spreading misinformation about the virus.
  <br>
  <br>
  He disputes the anti-vaccine tag, saying he instead wants more rigorous testing of vaccines. However, he chaired the Children's Health Defense, a non-profit organisation that focuses on anti-vaccine messaging. (Reuters)

    President Xi inaugurates new Peru megaport

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday inaugurated Latin America's first Beijing-funded port in Chancay, Peru -- a symbol of China's growing influence on the continent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$3.5-billion complex, about 80 kilometres north of Lima, is meant to serve as a hub for Chinese trade as the country prepares for the threat of major tariff hikes once Donald Trump re-enters the White House for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The port was officially opened in a ceremony overseen virtually by Xi and Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte from Lima, where they will attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Friday and Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China plays a major role in the growth of our economy," Boluarte said at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi, for his part, said the port would help "promote connectivity" between South America and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are witnessing... the birth of a new land-sea channel between Asia and Latin America in the new era," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru -- one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies over the past decade -- is China's fourth-largest Latin American trading partner, with bilateral flows of nearly US$36 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States as they trade with Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay is the latest addition to infrastructure projects built under the Belt and Road Initiative to stimulate trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed Cosco Shipping Ports, which owns 60 percent of the port, has a 30-year concession to operate the terminal and has forecast it will handle up to a million containers in its first year of operation. (AFP)

    High security as Israel draw with France in Paris

<img alt="The Israeli team on the pitch after the match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779241_1_20241115080700.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel and France played out a goalless draw in a Nations League football match in Paris on Thursday surrounded by a huge security operation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 4,000 police and members of the security forces patrolled inside and outside the Stade de France to prevent a repetition of the attacks on fans of Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A further 1,600 civilian security personnel were also on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards had to intervene at one point to stop fans of both nations from clashing in the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos taken by spectators and posted on the X social media platform showed fans, some with Israeli flags, running along the rows of seats at the stadium while other supporters whistled and booed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the stadium security team moved between the two groups to separate them and the incident was over within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tension surrounding the fixture caused many fans to stay away with just 16,611 in a stadium that holds up to 80,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 Israeli fans attended the match despite calls from Israeli authorities to avoid the fixture. Around 600 members of the Jewish community in France travelled to the stadium in buses with a police escort.
  <br>
  <br>
  French authorities mounted a huge security operation after the government defied calls from some French lawmakers to postpone the match or move it to another city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not give in to anti-Semitism anywhere, and violence – including in the French Republic – will never prevail, nor will intimidation," President Emmanuel Macron, who attended the game, told BFMTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the game to assure him that French authorities had taken the necessary security measures for the match to pass off smoothly, the president's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An elite police unit guarded the Israeli team from the moment they arrived on French soil. Israel coach Ran Ben Simon said the security had been "extraordinary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to thank the security people for protecting us," he said in a post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incidents in the Netherlands took place with anti-Israeli sentiment and reported anti-Semitic acts across the world soaring as Israel wages wars against Iran-backed Islamist militants in Lebanon and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The violence in Amsterdam flared after Maccabi fans in the city for a match against Ajax set fire to a Palestinian flag and vandalised a taxi 24 hours earlier, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the match, Maccabi fans were chased by men on scooters and beaten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amsterdam's mayor Femke Halsema called it a "poisonous cocktail of anti-Semitism and hooliganism".
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutch far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders blamed the violence on "Muslims". (AFP)

    World's largest coral found near Solomon Islands

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing on Thursday a major discovery "pulsing with life and colour".
 <br>
  <br>
  The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they had stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and colour," marine ecologist Enric Sala said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The standalone structure had been growing for some 300 years, the researchers said, formed from a "complex network" of tiny coral polyps.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was distinct from a coral reef, which is made from many distinct coral colonies, they explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measuring 34 metres wide and 32 metres long, the team said the "mega coral" was three times bigger than the previous record holder – a coral dubbed "Big Momma" in American Samoa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor," said lead scientist Molly Timmers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was longer than a blue whale and was thought to be "so colossal" that it could "be seen from space".
  <br>
  <br>
  The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands in an area known as the Three Sisters.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope," said coral scientist Eric Brown. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has arrived in Lima, kicking off a week-long diplomatic visit of South America during which he will attend the Apec Leaders’ meeting and the G20 summit in Brazil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peru pulled out all the stops at the airport, rolling out the red carpet while soldiers performed a guard of honour as Xi’s chartered jet landed just after noon, Lima time.
  <br>
  <br>
  First to greet the Chinese leader was Gustavo Adrianzen, the Peruvian Prime minister who stood in for President Dina Boluarte while she was occupied by other Apec engagements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who arrived the previous night, also greeted Xi on the tarmac, alongside Beijing’s top diplomat in Peru, Song Yang.
  <br>
  <br>
  After shaking hands, Xi and Lee had a brief conversation as dozens of officials, bodyguards, and media representatives watched on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president then headed to Government Palace for a state reception by his counterpart Boluarte.
  <br>
  <br>
  On top of their agenda was the inauguration of the Chancay megaport, which is jointly funded and owned by Chinese shipping giant Cosco.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders were also expected to sign bilateral agreements covering trade and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will also meet US President Joe Biden during his time in Lima, before moving on to Rio de Janeiro next week for the G20 summit.

    India's toxic smog hides landmarks, delays flights

<img alt="Dense fog wreathed worshippers at the Golden Temple in Punjab. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779185_1_20241114203648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Toxic smog obscured India's famed monument to love, the Taj Mahal, as well as Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, becoming too thick to see through in several places.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city of Lahore in neighbouring Pakistan ranked as the world's most polluted in winter's annual scourge across the region, worsened by dust, emissions, and smoke from fires burnt illegally in India's farming states of Punjab and Haryana.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the city of Agra, the Taj Mahal was barely visible from the gardens in front of the 17th-century monument, while dense fog wreathed worshippers at the Golden Temple in Punjab, television images showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi flights also faced delays, with tracking website Flightradar24 showing 88 percent of departures and 54 percent of arrivals were delayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials blamed high pollution, combined with humidity, becalmed winds and a drop in temperature for the smog, which cut visibility to 300 metres at the city's international airport, which diverted flights in zero visibility on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  More patients flocked to hospitals, particularly children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There has been a sudden increase in children with allergies, cough and cold ... and a rise in acute asthma attacks," Sahab Ram, a paediatrician in Punjab's Fazilka region, told news agency ANI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi's minimum temperature fell to 16.1 degrees Celsius on Thursday from 17 degrees Celsius the previous day, weather officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its pollution ranked in the 'severe' category for the second consecutive day, with a score of 430 on an index of air quality maintained by the top pollution panel that rates a score of zero to 50 as 'good'.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pollution in New Delhi is likely to stay in the 'severe' category on Friday, the earth sciences ministry said, before improving to 'very poor', or an index score of 300 to 400.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of farm fires to clear fields in northern India has risen steadily this week to almost 2,300 on Wednesday from 1,200 on Monday, the ministry's website showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, was rated the world's most polluted city on Thursday, in live rankings kept by Swiss group IQAir. Authorities there have also battled hazardous air this month. (Reuters)

    Philippines braces for more storms ahead

<img alt="Rescuers fetch residents during a forced evacuation operation in Buguey town, Cagayan province, north of Manila, ahead of Super Typhoon Usagi's landfall. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779129_1_20241114154252.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philippines raised its highest storm alert and evacuated thousands of people on Thursday, as Super Typhoon Usagi barrelled towards its already disaster-ravaged north.
 <br>
  <br>
  Packing sustained winds of up to 185 kilometres an hour, Usagi is set to hit the main island of Luzon later on Thurday -- the fifth storm to threaten the country in just three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The brutal wave of weather disturbances has already killed 159 people and prompted the United Nations to request US$32.9 million in aid for the worst-affected regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national weather agency said the winds could cause "almost total damage to structures of light materials, especially in highly exposed coastal areas", and "heavy damage" to buildings otherwise considered "low-risk".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense to torrential rain" and potentially "life-threatening" coastal waves of up to three metres were also forecast over two days, with the storm warning raised to the highest signal on a five-step scale.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Cagayan province, where the storm is expected to make landfall, officials worked in driving rain to remove residents along the coasts and on the banks of already swollen rivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday it was preemptive evacuations. Now we're doing forced evacuations," local disaster official Edward Gaspar said, adding 1,404 residents were sheltering at a municipal gym.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many more evacuees in nearby villages but we haven't had time to visit and count them," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cagayan's civil defence chief Rueli Rapsing said he expects local governments to take 40,000 people to shelters, roughly the same number that were preemptively evacuated ahead of Typhoon Yinxing, which struck Cagayan's north coast earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 5,000 Cagayan residents were still in shelters following the previous storms because the Cagayan River, the country's largest, remained swollen from heavy rain that fell in several provinces upstream.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Usagi, Tropical Storm Man-yi is also forecast to strike the Philippines' population heartland around the capital Manila this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Typhoons are overlapping. As soon as communities attempt to recover from the shock, the next tropical storm is already hitting them again," UN Philippines Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Gustavo Gonzalez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this context, the response capacity gets exhausted and budgets depleted."
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people and keeping millions in enduring poverty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A recent study showed that storms in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change. (AFP)

 Several airlines resumed flights to Bali on Thursday, after cancelling trips to and from the Indonesian resort island due to huge eruptions at a nearby volcano.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eighty-three international routes were cancelled on Wednesday, the general manager of Bali's international airport said in a statement, after Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki spewed a nine-kilometre tower of ash into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcano has erupted more than a dozen times over the last two weeks, killing at least nine people and forcing the evacuation of thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qantas and Jetstar resumed their services to Bali, Australia's Qantas Group said in a statement on Thursday, noting "improved" conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to monitor the changing conditions and volcanic activity," it said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of Thursday morning, Bali's airport had recorded another 32 international flight cancellations while 180 international flights were scheduled, the airport's general manager Ahmad Syaugi Shahab said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that volcanic ash from Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki had been heading away from the airport since Wednesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope affected airline passengers can resume their travel on Thursday," Ahmad said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewotobi erupted again overnight into Thursday morning, and a thick ash column and lava flows could be seen pouring from its crater, according to authorities. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Samantha Harvey won the 2024 Booker Prize for her novel 'Orbital', a story about a single day aboard the International Space Station that ponders the beauty and fragility of Earth.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Orbital" tracks astronauts from Japan, Russia, the United States, Britain and Italy as they observe and reflect on their home planet, touching on themes of mourning, desire and the climate crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the 49-year-old Harvey's fifth novel, and was the top selling book on the shortlist of six finalists, having sold more copies than the past three Booker Prize winners combined.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judges of the prize, which is now in its 55th year, praised her writing for the "intensity of attention to the precious and precarious world".
  <br>
  <br>
  Past winners of the prestigious Booker, which is open to works of fiction written in English, include Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie, Yann Martel, Hilary Mantel, Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes and Kazuo Ishiguro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvey said she wrote the novel while stuck at home during the pandemic watching the space station's live camera. She likened the experience of her six characters "trapped in a tin can" to that of lockdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Set over 24 hours, the astronauts and cosmonauts of her story witness sixteen sunrises and sixteen sunsets as they circle the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  “To look at the Earth from space is like a child looking into a mirror and realizing for the first time that the person in the mirror is herself," said Harvey. "What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the novel “is not exactly about climate change, but implied in the view of the Earth is the fact of human-made climate change”.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her acceptance speech, Harvey dedicated the prize to "everybody who does speak for and not against the Earth; for and not against the dignity of other humans, other life; and all the humans who speak for and call for and work for peace".
  <br>
  <br>
  Writer and artist Edmund de Waal, who chaired the five-member judging panel, praised the “crystalline” writing and “capaciousness” of Harvey’s succinct novel - at 136 pages in its UK paperback edition, one of the shortest-ever Booker winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is a book that repays slow reading,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the judges spent a full day picking their winner and came to a unanimous conclusion. Harvey beat five other finalists from Canada, the United States, Australia and the Netherlands, chosen from among 156 novels submitted by publishers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvey walks away with a 50,000 pound prize which she said she would disburse “some of it on tax. I want to buy a new bike. And then the rest, I want to go to Japan”. (Agencies)

    China hawk Rubio gets Trump nod for secretary of state

<img alt="Marco Rubio, Trump's pick as secretary of state, has been sanctioned twice by China. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779000_1_20241114045203.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has announced that he is nominating Republican Senator and noted China hawk Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, as he quickly fills out his cabinet ahead of his January 20 inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who clashed bitterly with Rubio for the presidential nomination in 2016, said in a statement nominating him: "Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said in a statement that he will work with Trump "every day to carry out his foreign policy agenda."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the leadership of President Trump, we will deliver peace through strength and always put the interests of Americans and America above all else," Rubio said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants to Miami and vociferous opponent of Latin American communists, China and Iran, would be the first Hispanic as the top US diplomat.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 to sanction SAR and central government officials, and has in turn been sanctioned by Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio was among a flurry of new nominations announced by Trump. He also tabbed Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, and former Democratic representative Tulsi Gabbard as his director of national intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength," Trump said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also extolled Gaetz, a staunch ally who has defended Trump in his legal battles and impeachment fights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System," Trump posted on social media. "Matt will end Weaponized Government... and restore Americans' badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department."
  <br>
  <br>
  As attorney general, Gaetz would drive all aspects of the work of the US Justice Department, which for years has carried out an investigation into sex trafficking and obstruction of justice allegations involving him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaetz, who denies all wrongdoing, was told last year that there would be no charges against him, but he remains the subject of a House ethics investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican and Democratic senators immediately voiced doubts that Gaetz's nomination would survive the confirmation process, which can involve intense questioning during difficult, fraught hearings. (Agencies)
