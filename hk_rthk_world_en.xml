<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's former football federation chief Luis Rubiales gives his highly-anticipated version of events on Tuesday in the trial over his forced kiss on Jenni Hermoso that sparked global outrage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case has riveted the country since opening on February 3 and has turned Hermoso into an icon of the fight against macho culture and sexism in sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales was forced to resign in disgrace in 2023 after kissing Hermoso on the lips following Spain's triumph at that year's Women's World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are seeking two-and-a-half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales, 47, has called the kiss a "peck between friends celebrating" and denied any coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to now he has attended hearings without intervening as a slew of witnesses testified at the National Court near Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hermoso told the opening day of the trial she felt "disrespected" after a non-consensual kiss that "should not happen in any social or work setting".
  <br>
  <br>
  Her teammates have described how she cried and felt "overwhelmed" following the incident, while her brother Rafael Hermoso has said she came under pressure to downplay the incident to save Rubiales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former women's team manager Jorge Vilda and two ex-federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque, are also due to take the stand on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales minimised the importance of the kiss on Hermoso at the time and defied calls for his resignation at an emergency federation meeting in August 2023, railing against "false feminism".
  <br>
  <br>
  He resigned in September that year after Fifa suspended him and Spanish prosecutors opened an investigation into alleged sexual assault. (AFP)

    Corruption charges dropped against New York mayor

<img alt="The US Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791145_1_20250211115242.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Justice Department on Monday ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, arguing in a departure from long-standing norms the case was interfering with the mayor’s ability to aid the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told prosecutors in New York they were “directed to dismiss” the bribery charges against Adams immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bove said the order was not based on the strength of evidence in the case, but rather because it had been brought too close to Adams re-election campaign and was distracting from the mayor’s efforts to assist in the Trump administration’s law-and-order priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime,” Bove wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo also ordered prosecutors in New York not to take “additional investigative steps” against the Democrat until after November's mayoral election, though it left open the possibility that charges could be refiled after that following a review.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intervention and reasoning — that a powerful defendant could be too occupied with official duties to face accountability for alleged crimes — marks a striking deviation from long-standing justice department norms.
  <br>
  <br>
  An attorney for Adams, Alex Spiro, said the justice department’s order had vindicated the mayor’s claim of innocence.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Now, thankfully, the mayor and New York can put this unfortunate and misguided prosecution behind them," said Spiro, who has also represented Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case against Adams was brought under the previous US attorney for the district, Damien Williams, who stepped down before Trump became president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo follows months of speculation that Trump would take steps to end the case against Adams, who was charged in September with accepting bribes of free or discounted travel and illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals seeking to buy his influence. (AP)

    Google complies with orders to rename 'Gulf of Mexico'

<img alt='Google Maps users in the United States will see the "Gulf Mexico" renamed as "Gulf of America" in compliance with White House executive orders. File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791142_1_20250211113431.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Google on Monday changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to "Gulf of America" for those using its Maps platform inside the United States, complying with an executive order by President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tech giant wrote in a blog post that users outside the United States will continue to see both the original and new name for the Gulf of Mexico, as is the case for other disputed locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People using Maps in the US will see 'Gulf of America,' and people in Mexico will see 'Gulf of Mexico.' Everyone else will see both names," Google wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google said the change aligns with its policy of following official US government geographic designations through the Geographic Names Information System.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon taking office, Trump signed executive orders not only changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico but also reverting the name of Denali, America's highest peak, to its former moniker Mt. McKinley.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2015, then-president Barack Obama officially recognised the Alaska mountain as Denali, the name used by Alaska Natives for centuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's renamings sparked criticism from indigenous groups in Alaska, who have long advocated for maintaining the Denali name, and raised diplomatic concerns with Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has cheekily suggested calling the United States "Mexican America," pointing to a map from before one-third of her country was seized by the United States in 1848. (AFP)

    Trump declares paper straws 'don't work'

<img alt='US President Donald Trump said that paper straws favoured by environmentalists "explode" in a "matter of minutes". Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791118_1_20250211093009.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump is moving to reverse a federal push away from plastic straws, declaring that paper straws don't last very long.
 <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,” Trump said on Monday as he signed an executive order to review federal purchasing policies that restrict plastic straws.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move by Trump - whose 2019 re-election campaign sold Trump-branded re-usable plastic straws - targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump declared President Joe Biden’s policy “DEAD!” in a social media post over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said he thinks "it's okay” to continue using them.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think that plastic is going to affect the sharks very much as they’re... munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also complained that paper straws "don't work".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode. If something's hot, they don't last very long, like a matter of minutes, sometimes a matter of seconds." Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Straws are just the beginning,” Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. "Back to Plastic is a movement we should all get behind.”
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.
  <br>
  <br>
  Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tonnes of new plastic. About 40 per cent of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea last year but didn’t reach an agreement. (Agencies)

    US slaps 25 percent tariffs on steel, aluminum

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump substantially raised tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Monday to a flat 25 percent "without exceptions or exemptions", although he agreed to consider an exemption on Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a telephone call with Australia’s prime minister on Tuesday that took place before the tariff rise, Trump said the US trade surplus with Australia was one of the reasons he was considering an exemption.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We actually have a surplus," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about trade with Australia. “It’s one of the only countries which we do. And I told (Albanese) that that’s something that we’ll give great consideration to.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia had an exemption from such tariffs during Trump’s first administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed proclamations raising the US tariff rate on aluminium to 25 percent from his previous 10 percent rate and eliminating country exceptions and quota deals as well as hundreds of thousands of product-specific tariff exclusions for both metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminium to be "smelted and cast" within the region to curb US imports of minimally-processed metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he signed the order at the White House, Trump said he would follow Monday's action with announcements about reciprocal tariffs on all countries that impose duties on US goods over the next two days, and said he was also looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about threats of retaliation by other countries against his new tariffs, Trump said: "I don't mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's tariffs almost immediately drew criticism from Canada, the largest source of steel imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, called Trump a destabilising force in the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the proclamations, shares in US steel and aluminium makers jumped, while shares in European and Asian steelmakers fell. The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and industry data. (Agencies)

    Trump pauses work at US consumer protection agency

<img alt="Elon Musk (right) and Republicans have long accused the independent agency of overreach. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791097_1_20250211035951.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration has informed staff at the country's consumer protection agency that it is temporarily shuttering its headquarters and pausing all work, according to an email shared on Monday with AFP.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was set up in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis and is tasked with protecting American consumers from corporate misconduct.
  <br>
  <br>
  It serves as a watchdog over a variety of consumer issues ranging from mortgages to credit cards to debt collection, and has long been a target of Republican lawmakers and industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the message to staff, acting CFPB director Russell Vought said the agency's Washington office would be closed this week, and told employees not to show up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Please do not perform any work tasks," said Vought, Trump's new director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and a key architect of the conservative plan known as Project 2025 to reform the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vought added that staff would need to seek written permission from him before doing any urgent work going forward, and should otherwise "stand down from performing any work task."
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans have long accused the independent agency of overreach, with some of Trump's most ardent supporters, including the tech billionaire Elon Musk, calling for its closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union representing CFPB employees filed two lawsuits against Vought on Sunday, accusing him of trying to shut down the agency -- which was created by Congress, and of giving the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to employees' personal information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vought's actions reflected "an unlawful attempt to thwart Congress's decision to create the CFPB to protect American consumers," the National Treasury Employees Union argued in one of the lawsuits.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFPB "has long functioned as another woke, weaponized arm of the bureaucracy that leverages its power against certain industries and individuals disfavored by so-called 'elites,'" the White House said in a statement published on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the administration of President Donald J. Trump, the weaponization ends right now," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to pause all work at CFPB and close down its offices appears to be an attempt to curtail its oversight powers without shuttering it entirely, something that would require congressional approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress built the CFPB, and no one other than Congress, not the president, not Musk, not Vought, can shut it down," Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who helped create the agency, said in a video message.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement, Democrats including Warren announced plans for a protest outside the CFPB's Washington offices for Monday, to "sound the alarm" against Musk and Vought's "attempt to kill" the agency. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian group Hamas said it will delay the release of more Israeli hostages planned for Saturday until further notice, according to a statement by the group’s spokesperson on Telegram.
 <br>
  <br>
  Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Qassam Brigades, said, “During the past three weeks, the resistance leadership has monitored the enemy’s violations and failure to abide by the terms of the agreement, including delaying the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, and targeting them with shelling and gunfire.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We affirm our commitment to the terms of the agreement as long as the occupation commits to them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday they completed their fifth hostage-prisoner exchange, with three Israeli hostages and 183 Palestinian prisoners released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz called the announcement by Hamas a "complete violation" of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said Palestinians would have no right of return to Gaza under his US takeover plan, describing his proposal in excerpts of an interview released on Monday as a "real estate development for the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told Fox News Channel's Bret Baier that "I would own it" and that there could be as many as six different sites for Palestinians to live outside Gaza under the plan, which the Arab world and others in the international community have rejected. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Political and tech industry leaders descended on Paris on Monday for a two-day summit on artificial intelligence, hoping to find common ground on the revolutionary technology set to remake business and society across the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the summit aims to lay the groundwork for governing the nascent sector, as global powers race to play leading roles in the fast-developing technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's meeting of around 1,500 guests in the French capital's opulent Grand Palais will feature lectures and panel discussions outlining the promises of and challenges posed by AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Political leaders, including US Vice President JD Vance and Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, are set to rub shoulders with the likes of OpenAI boss Sam Altman and Google chief Sundar Pichai.
  <br>
  <br>
  A largely suit-wearing crowd of men and women speaking languages from all over the world gathered under the glass-and-steel dome of the great hall, built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selected companies, academics and non-profit groups were showing off their work with AI at stands around the cavernous space decked out with screens and geodesic domes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two years on from the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, able to respond to all kinds of natural-language prompts, "artificial intelligence fuels both immense hopes and, at times, exaggerated fear," Macron's AI envoy Anne Bouverot told guests as she opened the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  She promised a "turning point" that would bring more countries on board with AI development that until now has been restricted to a few advanced economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on the agenda is "sustainable development" of the resource- and energy-hungry technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know that AI can help mitigate climate change, but we also know that its current trajectory is unsustainable," Bouverot said. (AFP)

<img alt="Leftist candidate Luisa Gonzalez will compete in the run-off in April to try to unseat the incumbent Daniel Noboa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791001_1_20250210125151.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ecuador will choose its next president in a presidential run-off election after conservative incumbent Daniel Noboa and leftist lawyer Luisa González garnered enough votes on Sunday to beat 14 other candidates.
 <br>
  <br>
  The contest will be a repeat of the October 2023 snap election that earned Noboa a 16-month presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runoff election is set for April 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing supporters in Quito, Gonzalez hailed her stronger-than-expected showing against the conservative incumbent as a "victory" for the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures released by Ecuador’s National Electoral Council after 66 percent of ballots were tallied showed Noboa received more than 3.09 million votes, or 44.7 percent, while González earned over 3.02 million votes, or 43.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of Sunday's candidates promised voters to reduce the widespread crime that has plagued the country in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighbouring Colombia and Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  So many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses were a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years can turn Ecuador around or if Noboa deserves more time in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ecuador’s National Electoral Council reported that more than 83 percent of the roughly 13.7 million eligible voters cast ballots. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador. (Agencies)

    Trump at Super Bowl in first for sitting US president
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790989_1_20250210120317.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Bowl extravaganza was watched by a star-studded 65,719 crowd bristling with celebrities and VIPs headed by Donald Trump, who became the first sitting US president to attend the event after jetting into New Orleans from Florida on Air Force One earlier in the day following a round of golf with Tiger Woods.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has had an uneasy relationship with the NFL over the years, triggering uproar in 2017 after attacking players for kneeling in protest against racial injustice during renditions of the US national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the US leader was given a broadly positive reception at the Superdome after arriving at the venue shortly before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after arriving, Trump met with first responders and family members of victims of the January 1 attack in New Orleans that left 14 people dead and dozens wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, loud cheering could be heard among the crowd when the Superdome's giant screen showed Trump saluting during the national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  That warm applause was in stark contrast to the booing that rang around the venue early in the first quarter when the same screen showed pop icon Taylor Swift sitting in the VIP seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, expressed hope the nation could come together for the Super Bowl, which is by far the biggest annual event on the American sporting calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Football is America's most popular sport -- for good reason -- it fosters a sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together and strengthening communities," Trump said in a statement released by the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swift, watching boyfriend and Chiefs ace Travis Kelce, was among a galaxy of stars crowded into the venue, with the likes of Beatles legend Paul McCartney rubbing shoulders with Hollywood actors Kevin Costner, Paul Rudd and Anne Hathaway and soccer star Lionel Messi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The catcalls for Swift -- who backed Trump's opponent Kamala Harris in last year's election -- were not lost on the US President.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later shared a post on his TruthSocial network which read: "Trump gets massive cheers at the Super Bowl while Taylor Swift gets booed - the world is healing!" (AFP)

    Lamar entertains at Super Bowl with dig at Drake

<img alt="Kendrick Lamar was the main performance during the Super Bowl halftime show. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790985_1_20250210113933.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Kendrick Lamar entertained a packed stadium crowd and audiences around the world watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, teasing and then delivering his ubiquitous, Grammy-winning diss track "Not Like Us."
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Superdome in New Orleans, Lamar was introduced by actor Samuel L Jackson dressed in a top hat as Uncle Sam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dancers in all white, all red and all blue piled out of a Buick Grand National GNX, the car that inspired the name of Lamar's recent album "GNX."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Lamar spun through "Squabble Up," "DNA" and other hits before telling a group of female dancers: "I want to perform their favourite song, but you know they want to sue."
  <br>
  <br>
  A few beats of "Not Like Us" played, but Lamar switched to a duet of "Luther" with R&B singer SZA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" is part of a long-standing feud between Lamar and Canadian musician Drake, and there had been speculation that Lamar might skip the song at the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake filed a defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group, saying the song's false accusation that he is a paedophile has put him and his family in danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lamar went for it. At one point, he omitted the word "paedophiles" - opting instead for a scream - but included a line about seeking "A minor" in which the crowd sang along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" won five Grammy Awards a week ago, bringing Lamar's lifetime total to 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamar's appearance on the biggest stage in music followed big names from Beyonce to Prince, Madonna, Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Super Bowl typically draws more than 100 million live US viewers, the largest TV audience of the year. (Reuters)

    Trump to announce new steel, aluminium tariffs
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790961_1_20250210084828.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25-percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States, on top of existing metals duties, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And very simply, it's, if they charge us, we charge them," Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said that while the US government would allow Japan's Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management," Trump said of US Steel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former president Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump's announcement what would happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80 percent in 2019 after Trump's initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China's global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of steelmakers in Asia mostly fell on Monday, save for those with operations in the United States. The US dollar rose and US Treasury yields ticked higher. (Agencies)

    Netanyahu says Israel to follow up on Trump Gaza plan

<img alt="Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking on Fox News. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790931_1_20250209211442.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed US President Donald Trump's widely criticised plan to move Palestinians out of the war-battered Gaza Strip, saying Israel is willing to "do the job".
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Fox News interview aired late on Saturday as the premier was wrapping up a visit to Washington, Netanyahu defended Trump's proposal, which has sparked concern and condemnation across the Middle East and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that President Trump's proposal is the first fresh idea in years, and it has the potential to change everything in Gaza," Netanyahu said, adding that it represents a "correct approach" to the future of the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All Trump is saying, 'I want to open the gate and give them an option to relocate temporarily while we rebuild the place physically'," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump "never said he wants American troops to do the job. Guess what? We'll do the job," Netanyahu declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel seized the Gaza Strip in 1967 and maintained a military presence in the territory until 2005, when it pulled out settlers and its troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  It subsequently imposed a crippling blockade on the Hamas-ruled territory and placed it under siege after the war began in October 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and armed groups in Gaza have fought several wars in recent years, but the latest -- sparked by the unprecedented 2023 Hamas attack on Israel -- has been the deadliest and most destructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said Trump's plan was a departure from the "same old, same old, same old -- we leave, Gaza becomes again occupied by these terrorists who use it as a base to attack Israel... It doesn't go anywhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we should pursue it," he added, cautioning that "the real issue" was finding a country that would agree to take in displaced Gazans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli leader also said that relocated Palestinians would have to "disavow terrorism" to be allowed to return to Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any attempts to force them out of Gaza would evoke dark memories of what the Arab world calls the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of Palestinians during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody describes Gaza as the biggest open-air prison in the world," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get the population out, allow them to leave. Not forcible eviction, not ethnic cleansing -- getting people out of what all these countries and all these do-gooders say is an open-air prison. Why are you keeping them in prison?" (AFP)

    Lebanon forms first new government in over 2 years

<img alt="The new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has vowed to reform Lebanon’s judiciary and battered economy. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790854_1_20250209024624.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lebanon’s new prime minister on Saturday formed the country’s first full-fledged government since 2022.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Joseph Aoun announced in a statement that he had accepted the resignation of the former caretaker government and signed a decree forming the new government with new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salam, a diplomat and former president of the International Court of Justice, vowed to “restore confidence between citizens and the state, between Lebanon and its Arab surroundings, and between Lebanon and the international community” and to implement reforms needed to bring the country out of an extended economic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Reform is the only path to a true salvation,” he said in a speech on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also promised to follow up on the implementation of a ceasefire agreement that ended the most recent war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group and political party Hezbollah in late November and to ensure that Israeli forces “withdraw from Lebanese territory until the last inch.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He pledged to ensure reconstruction in areas that suffered destruction during the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salam’s cabinet of 24 ministers, split evenly between Christian and Muslim sects, was formed less than a month after he was appointed and comes at a time when Lebanon is scrambling to rebuild its battered southern region and maintain security along its borders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though Hezbollah did not endorse Salam as prime minister, the group did engage in negotiations with the new prime minister over the Shiite Muslim seats in government, as per Lebanon’s power-sharing system.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was despite comments by US envoy Morgan Ortagus, who said in a speech in Beirut Friday that Washington had “set clear red lines from the United States” and that Hezbollah would not be “a part of the government.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments drew backlash from many in Lebanon who saw them as meddling in internal Lebanese affairs. (AP)

 A US judge issued an emergency order early on Saturday blocking Elon Musk's government reform team from accessing personal and financial data stored at the Treasury Department, court documents showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  US District Judge Paul A Engelmayer's order restricts giving access to Treasury Department payment systems and other data to "all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department."
  <br>
  <br>
  The temporary restrictive order, which remains in effect until a February 14 hearing, also says any such person who has accessed data from the Treasury Department's records since Donald Trump was inaugurated as president on January 20 must "immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, the world's richest person, is leading Trump's federal cost-cutting efforts under the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was brought against Trump, the Department of the Treasury and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday by attorneys general from 19 states.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attorneys general alleged the administration violated the law by expanding access to sensitive Treasury Department data to staff from Musk's Doge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Engelmayer's order said the states that sued would "face irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief."
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk ran into controversy last week with reports he and his team were accessing sensitive data stored at the Treasury Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  An internal assessment from the Treasury called the Doge team's access to federal payment systems "the single biggest insider threat the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has ever faced," US media reported. (AFP)

    Baltic nations disconnect from Russian power grid

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three Baltic states on Saturday cut ties with Russia's power grid to join the European Union's network, the culmination of a years-long process that gained urgency with Moscow's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – all former Soviet republics now in the European Union and Nato – had wanted to block Russia's ability to geopolitically blackmail them via the electricity system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have removed any theoretical possibility of Russia using energy (grid) control as a weapon," Lithuania's Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas – Estonia's former prime minister – had on Friday hailed the grid switch as "a victory for freedom and European unity."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vaiciunas said the Baltic states had completed the disconnection process at 9:09 local time (0709 GMT) on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been waiting for this moment for a long time," he told reporters, after speaking with his Estonian and Latvian counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The energy system of the Baltic states is finally in our own hands. We are in control," he added of the "historic" moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Baltics were now operating in so-called "isolated mode" before they integrate with the European grid on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official celebrations are planned across the Baltics, and authorities were on guard for any potential cyber-attacks linked to the grid switch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Latvia will physically cut a power line to Russia later on Saturday and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is to attend a ceremony with Baltic leaders in Vilnius on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Baltics have long prepared to integrate with the European grid but faced technological and financial issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The switch became more urgent after Russia started its war in Ukraine in 2022, spooking the Baltic states into thinking they could be targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  They stopped purchasing Russian gas and electricity after the war began, but their power grids remained connected to Russia and Belarus, controlled by Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  This left them dependent on Moscow for a stable electricity flow, which is crucial for factories and facilities requiring a reliable power supply. (AFP)

    Hamas frees three Israeli hostages in fifth Gaza swap

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas released three Israeli hostages on Saturday, the fifth group freed under a fragile Gaza ceasefire, with Israel condemning their "cruel" handover and worrying physical appearance.
 <br>
  <br>
  With Israel expected to release 183 prisoners in exchange, witnesses in the occupied West Bank saw a bus carrying freed Palestinians leave an Israeli jail and later arrive in the city of Ramallah.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth exchange since the truce took effect last month comes as negotiations are set to begin on a more permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came after President Donald Trump floated a proposal for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip and clear out its inhabitants, sparking global outrage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami and Eli Sharabi, who were all seized by militants during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the 15-month war, "crossed the border into Israeli territory," the Israeli military said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jubilant crowds in Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv cheered as they watched live footage of the three hostages, flanked by masked gunmen, brought on stage in Deir el-Balah before being handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the joy of their release was quickly overtaken by concern for their condition, with all three appearing thin and pale.
  <br>
  <br>
  The choreographed handover included forced statements from the three on stage, in which they stated support for finalising the next phases of the Israel-Hamas truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The disturbing images... serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt – there is no time to waste for the hostages! We must get them all out," said the Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose dejected-looking image appeared on a banner at the Deir el-Balah handover site, said that the images out of Gaza were "shocking."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's President Isaac Herzog denounced the treatment of the hostages who were paraded on stage, calling it "a crime against humanity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole world must look directly at Ohad, Or, and Eli – returning after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained – being exploited in a cynical and cruel spectacle by vile murderers," Herzog said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharabi, 52, was at his home in Kibbutz Beeri with his British-born wife and their two daughters when militants stormed it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The armed men shot their dog, before locking the family in their safe room and setting it on fire. The bodies of his wife and two daughters were later identified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ben Ami, who has dual Israeli-German citizenship, turned 56 in captivity. He was abducted from his home in Beeri along with his wife, who was released during the war's first truce in November 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival, where gunmen murdered his wife.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former hostage Yarden Bibas, who was freed last week by Hamas militants in Gaza, on Friday urged Netanyahu to help bring back his wife and two children from the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prime Minister Netanyahu, I'm now addressing you with my own words... bring my family back, bring my friends back, bring everyone home," Bibas said in his first public message following his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas previously said his wife Shiri and his two sons Ariel and Kfir – the youngest hostages – were dead, but Israel has not confirmed their deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hostage and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government on Friday to stick with the Gaza truce, even as Trump's comments sparked backlash across the Middle East and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An entire nation demands to see the hostages return home," the Israeli campaign group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time to ensure the agreement is completed – until the very last one," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian militants have so far freed 21 hostages in exchange for hundreds of mostly Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, aims to secure the release of 11 more hostages during the first 42-day phase of the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire were set to begin on Monday, but there have been no details on the status of the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu's office said that after Saturday's swap, an Israeli delegation will head to Doha for further talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second phase aims to secure the release of more hostages and pave the way for a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  During their October 2023 attack, militants took 251 hostages to Gaza. Seventy-three remain in captivity, including 34 whom the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliation has killed at least 47,583 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The United Nations considers the figures reliable. (AFP)

    Top opponent of India PM Modi loses New Delhi seat

<div class="itemFullText">
 A key Indian opposition leader and the former chief minister of the capital province Delhi lost his seat in local elections on Saturday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party tipped for victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arvind Kejriwal lost his seat to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), according to election commission results, reflecting expected wider losses by his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has governed the sprawling megacity of more than 30 million people for most of the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi's BJP is in government in the national parliament, but has not controlled the local legislature in the capital New Delhi since 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chanting BJP supporters danced in joy outside its New Delhi headquarters as vote results from the election on Wednesday were counted, waving flags and posters of Modi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Counting continues -- with the AAP and BJP level on nine declared seats -- but the election commission say Modi's party is leading in more than two-thirds of the 70-seat assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our victory is a sign of the people's faith in Prime Minister Modi's vision of progress," interior minister and BJP stalwart Amit Shah said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Delhi mandate shows that people can't be misled with lies every time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kejriwal, who rode to power as an anti-corruption crusader a decade ago, spent several months behind bars last year on accusations his party took kickbacks in exchange for liquor licences, along with several fellow party leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kejriwal has denied wrongdoing and characterised the charges as a political witch hunt by Modi's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was one of the key pillars of an opposition block formed ahead of India's general elections last year, when the BJP suffered significant losses despite holding on to power. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States added fewer jobs than expected in January; although hiring remained healthy, government data showed on Friday, marking resilience in the labour market heading into President Donald Trump's new term.
 <br>
  <br>
  Total employment rose by 143,000 jobs last month, according to the Labor Department, significantly lower than the revised 307,000 figure in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The January number was also below an analyst consensus estimate of 155,000, according to Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the jobless rate edged down to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent, beating analyst expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wage growth was better than analysts expected, accelerating to 0.5 percent, the report showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data added to signs that the US economy remained in excellent shape heading into Trump's second term, which began on January 20, analysts noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, took aim at downward revisions to last year's figures in the latest update, telling media that the Trump administration has "a lot of work to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taken together, December and January payroll figures paint a strong picture of the economy," added Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they expect that with these figures, the US central bank would not be in a rush to cut interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sectors like health care, retail trade, and social assistance saw job gains, the Labour Department said, while employment declined in industries like mining, alongside oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists warned that businesses may reconsider further hiring due to heightened tariff risks and Trump's plans to slow immigration. (AFP)

    Trump says to announce 'reciprocal' tariffs next week

<img alt="Donald Trump made tariffs a key platform of his presidential campaign. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790769_1_20250208043942.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Friday he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week, a major escalation of his trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the announcement during a meeting with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump did not identify which countries would be hit but suggested it would be a broad effort that could also help solve US budget problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said auto tariffs remained on the table amid reports that the White House was weighing potential exemptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll be announcing that, next week, reciprocal trade, so that we're treated evenly with other countries," Trump said. "We don't want any more, any less."
  <br>
  <br>
  The move would fulfil Trump's campaign promise to impose tariffs on American imports equal to rates that trading partners impose on American exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told Republican lawmakers of his plans during budget discussions at the White House on Thursday, three sources familiar with the plan told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and top aides have said they plan to use higher tariffs on foreign imports to help pay for extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which independent budget analysts say could add trillions of dollars to the US debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Increased tariffs could offset some of that cost, though they have only accounted for about 2 percent of annual revenues in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced tariffs of 25 percent on Canada and Mexico on Saturday but delayed them after a negative reaction from investors. The two largest US trading partners agreed to increase enforcement efforts at the border, a top Trump priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street extended losses on Friday following the Reuters report of Trump's discussion with lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  US consumer sentiment dropped to a seven-month low in February, and attitudes soured among Republicans as households took stock of what they believe will be a surge in inflation from Trump's tariffs. (Reuters)

    London's Grenfell Tower to be taken down after fire

<img alt='A UK public inquiry last year found the 72 deaths were "all avoidable." File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790752_1_20250207225504.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Grenfell Tower – where 72 people died in 2017 in Britain's worst residential fire since World War II – is to be demolished, the UK government confirmed on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move, which is expected to take two years, has angered some survivors and families of those killed in the massive inferno, which destroyed the 24-storey block in the west of Britain's capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Grenfell Tower will be carefully taken down to the ground," the government said in a statement, confirming what victims' groups said on Thursday they had been told.
  <br>
  <br>
  The work will start after the eighth anniversary of the blaze on June 14 and will be done carefully to ensure that materials can be included in any future memorial, the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said safety was the primary reason for the demolition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It remains stable because of the measures put in place to protect it, but even with the installation of additional props, the condition of the building will continue to worsen over time," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Engineers also advise it is not practicable to retain many of the floors of the building in place as part of a memorial that must last in perpetuity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire started in a faulty freezer, spreading rapidly due to highly combustible cladding fixed to the building's exterior.
  <br>
  <br>
  A public inquiry last year found the 72 deaths were "all avoidable" and blamed the "systematic dishonesty" of building firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also revealed decades-long government and regulatory failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the inquiry and report, victims' groups have criticised the government for failing to implement fire safety recommendations swiftly enough, including removing similar cladding from other buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Families have also condemned the delay in bringing criminal charges against those blamed for the disaster in the inquiry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to demolish the building divided victim groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell United, which represents some of the survivors and families, said on Thursday the decision was "disgraceful" and that victims were ignored by a short consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Grenfell Next of Kin said it was a "sensitive decision" that "came after a thorough engagement process" and was informed by "safety concerns" surrounding the structural integrity of the scaffolded remains of the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government insisted that deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, who also holds the housing brief, has offered the community several discussions online and in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear from conversations it remains a sacred site. It is also clear that there is not a consensus about what should happen to it," the government said in its statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being able to see the tower every day helps some people continue to feel close to those they lost. For others, it is a painful reminder of what happened and is having a daily impact on some members of the community." (AFP)

 China on Friday said it "regrets" Panama's decision to withdraw from the Belt and Road Initiative, after the Latin American nation ended its participation in the project in a concession to Washington.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing regrets Panama's decision," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, urging Panama to "consider the broader bilateral relationship and the long-term interests of both nations" and "resist external interference".
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin added that China firmly opposes the United States' actions to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation through pressure and coercion. (Xinhua/AFP)

<img alt="Israel has praised US sanctions on the International Criminal Court which issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu over his role in the Gaza war. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790687_1_20250207155955.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Criminal Court (ICC) on Friday called on its member states to stand up against sanctions imposed by US President Donald Trump, saying the move was an attempt to “harm its independent and impartial judicial work.”
 <br>
  <br>
  The White House issued the executive order on Thursday in response to what it called “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was referring to the arrest warrant the ICC issued last year for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hague-based court said it “condemns” the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Court stands firmly by its personnel and pledges to continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world,” the court said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We call on our 125 States Parties, civil society and all nations of the world to stand united for justice and fundamental human rights,” it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel on Friday praised Trump for imposing sanctions on the ICC, calling the court's actions against Israel "immoral" and illegitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday authorised economic and travel sanctions targeting people who work on ICC investigations of US citizens or American allies such as Israel, repeating the action he took during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move coincided with a visit to Washington by Israel's Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu, who - along with his former defence minister and a leader of Palestinian militant group Hamas - is wanted by the ICC over the war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions include freezing any US assets of those designated and barring them and their families from visiting the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 125-member ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression against the territory of member states or by their nationals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed the executive order after US Senate Democrats last week blocked a Republican-led effort to pass legislation setting up a sanctions regime targeting the war crimes court. (Agencies)

<img alt="Tehran has denounced the latest round of US sanctions targeting its oil industry. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790682_1_20250207151349.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran on Friday condemned as "illegal" and "unjustified" new financial sanctions by the United States that target a network accused of shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian crude oil to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The decision of the new US government to exert pressure on the Iranian nation by preventing Iran's legal trade with its economic partners is an illegitimate, illegal and violative measure," foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US move was "categorically unjustified and contrary to international rules", Baqaei added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of the Treasury on Thursday announced financial sanctions against an international network "facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars" to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The oil was shipped on behalf of Iran's Armed Forces General Staff and a sanctioned front company called Sepehr Energy Jahan Nama Pars, the treasury department wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions came after US President Donald Trump reinstated his "maximum pressure" policy against Iran over allegations the country is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran has slammed the reinstatement of the policy -- similar to one Trump levied against Tehran during his first term as president -- saying pursuing it would end in "failure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the tough policy of sanctions during Trump's first term, which ended in 2021, Washington withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal that had imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the deal -- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- until a year after Washington pulled out, but then began rolling back its commitments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to revive the 2015 deal have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Wednesday called for a "verified nuclear peace agreement" with Iran, adding that it "cannot have a Nuclear Weapon".
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran insists its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes and denies any intention to develop atomic weapons. (AFP)

    Fentanyl fatality rate 'higher in Canada than US'

<img alt="Edmonton, in Canada, holds an Overdose Awareness Day. File photo (AFP)" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790650_1_20250207093916.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fentanyl is killing more people per capita in Canada than in the United States, Ottawa's public safety minister said on Thursday, calling the two nations "connected" in combating the opioid crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has accused Canada of not doing enough to counter the flow of fentanyl across their shared border, and cited the issue as justification for his threatened import tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has committed to addressing those concerns, while maintaining that less than one percent of fentanyl in the United States comes from Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On per capita population, we're losing more Canadians than Americans are losing Americans," Public Safety Minister David McGuinty told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are connected with this crisis."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US estimates, an average of 205 Americans have died each day of opioid overdoses in recent years, mostly from fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada has seen 21 deaths per day, according to the latest data, but its population is about 12 times smaller than that of its southern neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGuinty's remarks came after he met with senior federal police and border agency officials "to operationalise" a US$900 million border security plan launched in response to Trump's tariffs threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25 percent tariffs - which Trump has also said were necessary to force action to stem migrant crossings - were scheduled to take effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the president granted Canada a 30-day reprieve to allow for further talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the last-minute deal to put off the tariffs, the prime minister agreed to name a point person to lead the fight against fentanyl. (AFP)

    Judge pauses Musk plan for mass cull of govt workers

<img alt="A protester holds a sign referencing Elon Musk, who is heading President Trump's drive to shrink the federal government, outside New York's City Hall. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790638_1_20250207084628.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge on Thursday paused a scheme masterminded by billionaire Elon Musk to slash the size of the US government by encouraging federal workers to quit through a mass buyout.
 <br>
  <br>
  The federal judge in Massachusetts ordered a temporary injunction on the plan's deadline - midnight Thursday - given by Musk for the country's more than two million government employees. The offer was to quit with eight months' pay or risk being fired in future culls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadline is now extended to Monday, when US District Judge George O'Toole will hold a hearing on the merits of the case brought by labour unions, US media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, the world's richest person and President Donald Trump's biggest donor, is in charge of a free-ranging entity called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, more than 40,000 staff have so far accepted the buyout deal - a relatively small number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unions representing some 800,000 civil servants and Democratic members of Congress are resisting the scheme and have challenged the legality of threats to fire civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the broader budget cutting campaign has already severely disrupted departments and agencies that for decades have run everything from education to national intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID, the government's agency for distributing aid around the world, has been crippled, with foreign-based staff ordered home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also repeatedly said he wants to shut down the Department of Education. The inducements to resign have further been extended to the CIA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt told reporters that federal workers should "accept the very generous offer" of a deferred resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said "competent" replacements would be found for those who "want to rip the American people off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the controversies swirling around the Musk plan is how much access the South African-born tycoon is getting to secret government data, including the Treasury's entire payment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg TV on Thursday that there was "a lot of misinformation" and that access to such data was only given to two Treasury employees who are working with Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent said those employees had "read-only" access, meaning they couldn't change the data. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino on Thursday rejected the United States' claim that it negotiated free passage for government vessels through the Panama Canal as an "absolute falsehood."
 <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal Authority, which runs the waterway linking the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean, has also rejected the claim by the US State Department that US government vessels would go through for free.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government, said it had not made any changes to charge fees or rights to cross the canal, adding its statement was directly in response to the US claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department had said earlier that Panama's government had agreed to no longer charge crossing fees for US government vessels, in a move that would save America millions of dollars a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With total responsibility, the Panama Canal Authority, as it has indicated, is willing to establish dialogue with relevant US officials regarding the transit of wartime vessels from said country," the canal authority responded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama has became a focal point of the Trump administration as the president has accused the Central American country of charging excessive rates to use its trade passage, one of the busiest in the world. (Reuters)

    January sets 'surprising' heat record: EU monitor

<img alt="The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January according to the European climate service Copernicus. File photo: AFP ." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790589_1_20250206214334.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last month was the hottest January on record, Europe's climate monitor said on Thursday, despite expectations that cooler La Nina conditions might quell a streak of record-breaking global temperatures.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Copernicus Climate Change Service said January was 1.75 degrees Celsius hotter than pre-industrial times, extending a persistent run of historic highs over 2023 and 2024, as human-caused greenhouse gas emissions heat the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate scientists had expected this exceptional spell to subside after a warming El Nino event peaked in January 2024 and conditions gradually shifted to a cooling La Nina phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the heat has lingered at record or near-record levels ever since, sparking debate among scientists about what other factors could be driving warming to the top end of expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is what makes it a bit of a surprise... you're not seeing this cooling effect, or temporary brake at least, on the global temperature that we were expecting to see," Julien Nicolas, a climate scientist from Copernicus, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  La Nina is expected to be weak and Copernicus said prevailing temperatures in parts of the equatorial Pacific Ocean suggested "a slowing or stalling of the move towards" the cooling phenomenon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas said it could disappear completely by March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists warn that every fraction of a degree of warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events like heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Copernicus said that global temperatures averaged across 2023 and 2024 had exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  This did not constitute a permanent breach of the long-term 1.5C warming target under the Paris climate accord -- but was a clear sign that the limit was being tested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Copernicus said Arctic sea ice in January hit a monthly record low, virtually tied with 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysis from the United States this week put it at the second-lowest in that dataset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, 2025 is not expected to follow 2023 and 2024 into the history books: scientists predict it will rank as the third hottest year yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Copernicus said it would be closely monitoring ocean temperatures throughout 2025 for hints about how the climate might behave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oceans are a vital climate regulator and carbon sink, and cooler waters can absorb greater amounts of heat from the atmosphere, helping to lower air temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also store 90 percent of the excess heat trapped by humanity's release of greenhouse gases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This heat is bound to resurface periodically," said Nicolas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that's also one of the questions -- is this what has been happening over the past couple of years?" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Grenfell Tower, which was engulfed in flames more than seven years ago in a disaster that killed 72 people, will be demolished, bereaved families and survivors said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire ripped through the 23-storey social housing block in one of London's richest areas during the early hours of June 14, 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Britain's deadliest blaze in a residential building since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell Next of Kin (GNK), which represents the relatives of nearly half of those who died, said Britain's deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, announced her decision to a room of families and survivors in a meeting on Wednesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the group, the demolition of the tower, which remains standing but covered in protective wrap, will only start after the eighth anniversary of the tragedy in June this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Engineers advising the government said the structure of the tower would worsen over time, and the building or part of it that was significantly damaged should be carefully taken down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do we wish the whole tower could stand forever? Yes. Is that an option? Not from a structural point of view," GNK said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell United said the voices of bereaved families and survivors were not heard or considered by Rayner during what they described as a short four-week consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ignoring the voices of bereaved on the future of our loved ones' gravesite is disgraceful and unforgivable," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department of housing, communities and local government did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but the decision was confirmed by Joe Powell, the member of parliament for Kensington, the area where the tower is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said on X that the decision had not been taken lightly: "Grenfell Tower will always be in our hearts as a community."
  <br>
  <br>
  A public inquiry into the fire, which published its final report last year, blamed the disaster on failings by the government, construction industry and, most of all, the firms involved in fitting the exterior with flammable cladding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several survivors and families have said the inquiry has delayed any criminal proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A commission looking at a future memorial on the site of the disaster said in its 2023 report that if the tower came down it should be "dismantled with care and respect".
  <br>
  <br>
  A final design for the memorial is expected by spring 2026, and construction could begin that year. (Reuters)

    'Cross-border e-commerce unaffected by policy changes'

<img alt="The Commerce Ministry urged the US to create a fair and predictable policy environment for the development of cross-border e-commerce. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790546_1_20250206171534.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said cross-border e-commerce remained competitive despite the scrapping of America's de minimis exemption for the import of small goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  The removal of the exemption means that goods from Chinese retailers, especially e-commerce players, are now subject to the additional US duties on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how a country adjusts its trade policy, the advantages and characteristics of cross-border e-commerce have not disappeared, and are still very competitive," said Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we hope that the US can follow the development trend of international trade, enhance supervision, and create a fair and predictable policy environment for the development of cross-border e-commerce."
  <br>
  <br>
  The elimination of the duty-free exemption for low value packages and US President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports have caused confusion, with the US Postal Services reversing a decision not to accept parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  While tariffs on Chinese goods went ahead on Tuesday, Trump suspended his threats of imposing levies on Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the move, He said Beijing is ready to work with other countries to "jointly respond to the challenges of unilateralism and trade protectionism".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unilateral imposition of tariffs by the US seriously violates World Trade Organisation rules. It is egregious in nature, and a typical unilateral trade protectionism that damages the rules-based multilateral trading system, disrupts the stability of global supply chains, and exacerbates international trade tensions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China does not proactively initiate trade disputes but will take necessary measures in response to one-sided bullying, He added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday warned that war-ravaged Gaza is not a political bargaining chip, following a proposal to take over the region from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a regular press briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiankun said China firmly supports the "legitimate national rights" of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people. It is an inalienable part of the territory of Palestine, not a bargaining chip for political games," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China firmly supports the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, believes that Palestinians governing Palestine is an important principle that must be upheld in the post-conflict governance of Gaza, and opposes the forced displacement of the people of Gaza,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a growing number of countries blocking access to DeepSeek, Guo said Beijing has never asked firms to illegally store data.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government attaches great importance to data privacy and security, and protects it in accordance with the law. We have never asked and will never ask any companies or individuals to collect or store data against the laws," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has all along opposed the move to overstretch the concept of national security, or politicise trade and tech issues. We will firmly protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies at the same time."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea became the latest government to warn about or place restrictions on the Chinese artificial intelligence startup, saying the firm did not respond to a data watchdog request about how it manages user information.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States said on Wednesday that its government vessels would be allowed to sail for free through the Panama Canal, following heavy pressure from President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  "US government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the US government millions of dollars a year," the State Department said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first public announcement of promises hinted at by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said that Panama offered concessions during his talks on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said he had told Panama that it was unfair for the United States to be in a position to defend the vital waterway and also to be charged for its use.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and Panama are scheduled to hold new talks on Friday to discuss the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama has became a focal point of the Trump administration as President Donald Trump has accused the Central American country of charging excessive rates to use its passage. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's industry ministry has temporarily blocked employee access to Chinese artificial intelligence startup, DeepSeek, a ministry official said, after it did not respond to a data watchdog request about how it manages user information.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier issued a notice calling on ministries and agencies to exercise caution about using AI services including DeepSeek and ChatGPT at work, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  State-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power said it had blocked use of AI services including DeepSeek earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean defence ministry has also blocked access to DeepSeek on its computers that are for military use, officials said on Thursday, and the foreign ministry has restricted access to DeepSeek in computers that connect to external networks, Yonhap News Agency said. The ministry said it cannot confirm specific security measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear if the ministries had taken any actions against ChatGPT.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban makes South Korea the latest government to warn about or place restrictions on DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia banned DeepSeek this week from all government devices over concerns on how it uses data.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launch by the Chinese startup of its latest AI models last month sent shockwaves through the tech world. The company says its models are on a par with or better than products developed in the United States and are produced at a fraction of the cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has said it used less-advanced H800 chips - permitted for sale to China until 2023 under US export controls - to power its large learning model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have also said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration that could lead to faster breakthroughs. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping met Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra in Beijing on Thursday, Xinhua news agency reported, as the two countries eye closer ties amid growing global uncertainties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn is on an official visit to China from February 5 to 8, marking her first visit to the country since taking office in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-day visit coincides with the 50th anniversary of China-Thailand diplomatic relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai leader's visit also came on the same day that Thailand began cutting electricity, fuel and internet services to areas in Myanmar along Thailand-Myanmar borders to tackle online fraud, an issue believed to be high on the agenda during the prime minister's visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks between Xi and Paetongtarn also come as Beijing is navigating a new trade war with the United States, triggered by US President Donald Trump's 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in women's sports, in his latest move targeting transgender people since returning to office.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From now on women's sports will be only for women," Trump said before he signed the order at the White House, surrounded by dozens of children and female athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With this executive order the war on women's sports is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top Republicans including US House Speaker Mike Johnson and firebrand Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene were among those in the audience to watch the signing ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, and we will not allow men to beat up, injure and cheat our women and our girls," Trump added to applause and cheers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order allows US government agencies to deny funds to schools that allow transgender athletes to compete on women's teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated... and risk your federal funding," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would now push the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to change its rules on transgender athletes before the 2028 Los Angeles Games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China filed a World Trade Organisation complaint on Wednesday against US President Donald Trump's new 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports and his cancellation of a duty-free exemption for low-value packages, arguing the actions are "protectionist" and break WTO rules.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's request for US trade consultations came as confusion reigned among shippers and retailers over Trump's cancellation of the "de minimis" exemption for package imports valued under US$800.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tax exemption has benefitted e-commerce firms including Shein, Temu and Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Customs and Border Protection official said all small packages from mainland China and Hong Kong needed to have customs entries on file prior to arrival, and there was the potential for some cargo to be sent back without this paperwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Washington correspondent, Simon Marks, said this could lead to significant delays in package deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So recipients are going to be told in order for you to receive delivery of this package, before you get it, you have to pay the duty, and that will then release the package from Customs," he told

  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is absolutely going to delay substantially, at least to begin with, the delivery of these items here in the United States, because the customer service is going to have to look at every single one of them - and there are a vast number of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Marks warned that apart from the supply chain disruption, consumers will also feel the pinch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Businesses] either have to absorb the tariffs, or they have to raise the price of the good that they are bringing in from outside the country and providing to American consumers," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's why so many economists here have argued that President Donald Trump and members of his economic inner circle simply don't understand the costs of tariffs to the American consumers, that they are inherently inflationary."
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTO said China submitted a request for consultations with the US on the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The request for consultations is the start of a dispute process that could lead to a ruling that Trump's duties violated trade rules in the same manner that a 2020 WTO ruling found that his first-term China tariffs broke trade regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such a victory would be unlikely to bring Beijing relief because the WTO's Appellate Body has been largely inoperable for years, as the US has blocked the appointment of appellate judges over what it views as judicial overreach by the body.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body is unable to function with fewer than three judges. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Japan Airlines plane that was taxiing on the tarmac of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport apparently clipped the tail of a parked Delta aircraft on Wednesday morning, airport authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities responded to the incident around 10:17am, the airport said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  All passengers from Japan Airlines flight 68 and Delta Air Lines flight 1921 were deplaned with no reported injuries, and response crews were working to move the aircraft off the ramp taxiway, the airport said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delta spokesperson Samantha Moore Facteau said in an email that its Boeing 737 was waiting to have ice removed from its exterior when the wing tip of another aircraft reportedly made contact with its tail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deicing, as it's known, can occur before a flight begins to taxi to the runway, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 142 passengers on board the flight to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and they were transferred to a new aircraft, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no reports of injuries for crew or passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason Chan, one of the passengers on the Delta flight, said the plane “jiggled back and forth” and shook a little bit when the collision occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after, the captain announced that the plane's tail had been hit. Passengers remained calm, Chan said, and eventually got off the plane to be taken back to the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport operations were minimally impacted because the incident occurred on a taxi lane, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate, spokesperson Sam Lichtman said in an emailed statement. (AP)

    Trump administration appears to walk back Gaza plan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House on Wednesday appeared to walk back elements of President Donald Trump's shock plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza and launch a US takeover of the devastated territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  A day after Trump said "the US will take over" and "own" Gaza and that Palestinians would "go to other countries," the administration sought to downplay expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Republican leader wanted Palestinians to be only "temporarily relocated" out of Gaza instead of permanently resettled in Arab-majority states like Egypt.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the rebuilding of Gaza would not be paid for by the United States and that US troops were not likely to be sent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been made very clear to the president that the United States needs to be involved in this rebuilding effort to ensure stability in the region for all people," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "that does not mean boots on the ground in Gaza, it does not mean American taxpayers will be funding this effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said Trump has been "very clear" that "he expects our partners in the region, particularly Egypt and Jordan, to accept Palestinian refugees, temporarily, so that we can rebuild their home."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a demolition site right now. It's not a liveable place for any human being," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the deployment of US troops into Gaza was being ruled out, Leavitt said: "The president has not committed to that just yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is ready to "look at all options" when asked if he was working on options to deploy troops to Gaza, but did not provide specifics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to working with our allies, our counterparts, both diplomatically and militarily, to look at all options," Hegseth told journalists as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Trump's idea "was not meant as hostile. It was meant as, I think, a very generous move – the offer to rebuild and to be in charge of the rebuilding."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump wants to support "rebuilding homes and businesses and things of this nature, so that then people can move back in," Rubio told reporters on a visit to Guatemala.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's surprise announcement on Tuesday sparked intense pushback from the Palestinian leadership and governments in the region and in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes in the context of mediated negotiations between Israel and the militant group Hamas to reach the "second phase" of a ceasefire deal that would bring a more permanent end to the devastating war in Gaza. (AFP)

    Monkeys attack tourists at Angkor Wat

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wild monkeys egged on by YouTubers have been rampaging at Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat complex, attacking tourists, wrecking temple stonework and damaging information boards, officials said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency that runs the Unesco-listed site warned visitors to steer clear of the growing gangs of "aggressive" macaques that live around the sprawling complex of ruins and have been biting tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The macaques are native to the lush forests that surround Angkor Wat, but the Apsara National Authority said human interaction – particularly by people filming content to post online – had changed their behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small number of YouTubers regularly fed monkeys to create videos and this has "changed the monkeys' natural behaviour from being wild animals to domestic ones that are aggressive, steal food, and cause injuries among people," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some have reportedly even filmed themselves abusing macaques.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long Kosal, a spokesman for the Apsara National Authority, said that as well as the danger posed to tourists, the agency was increasingly worried about the monkeys damaging the centuries-old stonework.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On top of biting visitors, they have been climbing up and pushing stones down, damaging temples," he said, adding that the macaques had also damaged information boards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency has urged tourists to leave the monkeys alone while visiting the ruins, and said it is looking for "an appropriate solution" to the problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Angkor Wat, built from the 9th to the 15th centuries, was the capital of the Khmer Empire and is Cambodia's top tourist attraction, bringing in valuable revenue to a poor country. (AFP)

    China vows 'necessary measures' over parcel halt

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has urged the United States to stop "politicising trade and economic issues" and vowed to take unspecified "necessary measures" after the United States Postal Service (USPS) announced it had temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The USPS said the suspension will remain in place until further notice, with the move coming after US President Donald Trump slapped extra tariffs on Chinese imports and ended a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government calls on the United States to stop politicising and weaponising trade and economic issues, stop going after or suppressing Chinese companies," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian at a regular media briefing on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said Beijing "deplores and firmly opposes" the move by Washington regarding Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, China announced countermeasures of tariffs on a number of US goods, which will take effect next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What [action] China takes is necessary to protect its legitimate rights and interests. Trade wars and tariff wars have no winners. Threatening China with pressure leads nowhere," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the United States to correct its wrongdoings, solve each side's concerns through equal-footed consultation, and promote the sound, stable and sustainable development of China-US relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing also called for dialogue between China and the US after Trump said he was in no hurry to speak to President Xi Jinping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said what is needed is not unilateral, additional tariffs but exchanges based on equality and mutual respect.

    People frustrated with postal suspension from HK to US

<div class="itemFullText">
 People in Hong Kong who wish to send mail to the United States expressed their frustration at the situation on Wednesday, after the US stopped receiving parcels from mainland China and the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States Postal Service announced on Tuesday that it was temporarily suspending inbound parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong until further notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkong Post's website showed postal services regarding packets and parcels to the US were temporarily not available. But people could still mail letters to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman at the General Post Office in Central said she was baffled by the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sending a gift to my son in college. They said I can't send a package, I can only send a letter. I'm not happy. I'm going to try SF Express and DHL," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman said she wanted to send a card and a congratulatory gift after her friend in the US had a baby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They weren't sure why, what happened. They just said it's suspended for now. I'm going to find somewhere else and see if I can send it another way," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK reached out to various international shipping companies, and DHL's customer service office said it was still accepting packages to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the company said guidelines are updated every half an hour and things may change.
  <br>
  <br>
  FedEx and UPS, meanwhile, said postal services were not affected, but it may take a longer time for parcels to arrive in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrangement came after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods, and scrapped a duty-free exemption policy for low-value packages.

    Philippine House votes to impeach VP Duturte

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippine lawmakers on Wednesday voted to send articles of impeachment against Vice President Sara Duterte to the Senate, a day before the current congressional session is set to end.
 <br>
  <br>
  While specifics of the impeachment were not divulged, the vote follows the filing of a trio of complaints last month accusing Duterte of crimes ranging from the "brazen misuse" of millions of dollars in public funds to plotting President Ferdinand Marcos's assassination.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having been filed by more than one-third of the membership of the House of Representatives, or a total of 215 members ... the motion is approved," House Speaker Martin Romualdez told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's fate now lies in the hands of the Philippines' 24 senators, two-thirds of whom must vote for her impeachment to make it a reality.
  <br>
  <br>
  A trial date has yet to be set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's filing comes days before campaigning officially begins for mid-term elections, widely expected to set the table for the 2028 presidential race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The relationship between Duterte and President Marcos is at a nadir, their former alliance giving way to a months-long public battle that has seen the trading of wild accusations, including an alleged death threat that remains under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Marcos had previously urged Congress not to pursue Duterte's impeachment, calling it a "storm in a teacup" that would distract the legislature from its primary responsibilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos's executive secretary Lucas Bersamin, however, said on Monday that the Office of the President would "not interfere" with the impeachment complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was widely tipped to succeed her father Rodrigo as president in 2022 elections but stepped aside to back Marcos and later ran for vice president on his ticket.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the alliance has since imploded. In November, she delivered an expletive-laden speech saying she had ordered someone to kill Marcos if she herself was assassinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  She later denied that her comments constituted a death threat, saying she had only been expressing "consternation" with the administration's failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alleged assassination threat was among the allegations included in the last of the three complaints filed against Duterte, lodged December 19 by seven Manila-based Catholic priests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Impeachment is the necessary, ultimate line of defence against corruption at the highest rungs of officialdom," it said. "She cannot be vice president a minute longer." (AFP)

    Saudi Arabia downplays potential ties with Israel

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia said Wednesday it would not formalise ties with Israel unless a Palestinian state is established, after Israel's prime minister remarked that he thought normalisation with the Gulf kingdom was "going to happen".
 <br>
  <br>
  "Saudi Arabia will continue its relentless efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that," the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both US President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden have backed Israel and Saudi Arabia having diplomatic relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Riyadh paused tentative talks on the matter early in the Gaza conflict and hardened its rhetoric as the war continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign ministry's statement came swiftly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said establishing formal relations "is not only feasible, I think it's going to happen".

  <br>
  His government remains opposed to the internationally backed two-state solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu was speaking at the White House alongside Trump, whose administration in 2020 brokered accords which saw Israel establish relations with the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Bahrain.
  <br>
  <br>
  That raised hopes of a similar deal with Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's richest economy and guardian of Islam's two holiest sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia does not recognise Israel, but since 2020 has been negotiating rapprochement in exchange for a US defence pact and Washington's help on a civilian nuclear programme. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands begin voting in the Indian capital’s state legislature election on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party trying to unseat a powerful regional group that has ruled New Delhi for over a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Voters walked to polling booths on a cold, wintry morning to cast their ballots across the sprawling capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manish Sisodia, a key Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader, and others offered prayers in a temple before voting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is up against the AAP, led by Arvind Kejriwal, which runs New Delhi and has built a vast support base on its welfare policies and an anti-corruption movement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kejriwal, a popular crusader against corruption, suffered a setback as he himself faced graft allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AAP won 62 out of 70 seats in a landslide victory in the last election, held in 2020, leaving BJP with only eight and the Congress party with none.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AAP had also swept the 2015 state elections, winning 67 seats, with the BJP taking three.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi and Kejriwal have both campaigned vigorously in roadshows with thousands of supporters tailing them.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have offered to revamp government schools and provide free health services and electricity, and a monthly stipend of over 2,000 rupees (US$25) to poor women.
  <br>
  <br>
  Results are due on Saturday.
  <br>

    US aid agency places global staff on leave

<img alt="The Trump administration is carrying out plans to fold the USAID humanitarian agency and merge it into the US State Department. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790336_1_20250205112314.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trump administration is placing US Agency for International Development (USAID) direct-hire staffers around the world on leave except those deemed essential, upending the aid agency’s six-decade mission overseas.
 <br>
  <br>
  A notice posted online Tuesday gives the workers 30 days to return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move had been rumoured for several days and was the most extreme of several proposals considered for consolidating the agency into the State Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other options had included closures of smaller USAID missions and partial closures of larger ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programmes worldwide shut down after US President Donald Trump imposed a sweeping freeze on foreign assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the space of a few weeks, Trump's political appointees, including tech tycoon Elon Musk’s budget-slashing team, have dismantled the aid agency despite outcry from Democratic lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have ordered a spending stop that has paralysed US-funded aid and development work around the world, gutted the senior leadership and workforce with furloughs and firings, and closed Washington headquarters to staffers Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers said the agency’s computer servers were carted away.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” Musk boasted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk’s teams had taken USAID’s website offline over the weekend and it came back online Tuesday night, with the notice of recall or termination for global staffers its sole post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to withdraw direct-hire staff and their families earlier than their planned departures will likely cost the government tens of millions of dollars in travel and relocation costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff being placed on leave include both foreign and civil service officers who have legal protection against arbitrary dismissal and being placed on leave without reason. (AP)

    Australia bans DeepSeek on govt devices

<img alt="Australia's decision to ban DeepSeek follows similar action in Italy, while other countries in Europe and elsewhere are also looking into the AI firm. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790323_1_20250205102715.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices, a top official said Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The DeepSeek chatbot - developed by a China-based startup - has astounded industry insiders and upended financial markets since it was released last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a growing list of countries including South Korea, Italy and France have voiced questions over how the application handles personal data and what information is used to train DeepSeek's AI system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia upped the ante overnight banning DeepSeek from all government devices, one of the toughest moves against the Chinese chatbot yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an action the government has taken on the advice of security agencies. It's absolutely not a symbolic move," said government cyber security envoy Andrew Charlton.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with national broadcaster ABC, Charlton voiced concern that uploaded information "might not be kept private".
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Home Affairs Department issued a directive to government employees overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After considering threat and risk analysis, I have determined that the use of DeepSeek products, applications and web services poses an unacceptable level of security risk to the Australian Government," Department of Home Affairs Secretary Stephanie Foster said in the directive.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of Wednesday all non-corporate Commonwealth entities must "identify and remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services on all Australian Government systems and mobile devices," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The directive also required that "access, use or installation of DeepSeek products" be prevented across government systems and mobile devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration and experimentation that could lead to faster breakthroughs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the firm has unveiled large language models challenging the dominate tools developing by its US rivals, but at a lower cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2018, Australia banned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from its national 5G network, citing national security concerns, and TikTok was banned from government devices in 2023 on the advice of Australian intelligence agencies. (AFP & agencies)

    Trump says US should take over Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump predicted on Tuesday that the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, home to more than two million Palestinians, could become "the Riviera of the Middle East" as he announced his plan to take control of it.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Riviera of the Middle East. This could be something that could be so magnificent," Trump said at a joint press conference with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at which he again voiced hopes that Palestinians could be removed from Gaza, and said the United States would redevelop the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love Israel. I will visit there and I'll visit Gaza and I'll visit Saudi Arabia and I'll visit other places all over the Middle East," Trump told reporters at the White House, without committing to any timetable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as talks are ramping up this week with the promise of surging humanitarian aid and reconstruction supplies to help the people of Gaza recover after more than 15 months of devastating conflict. Now Trump wants to push roughly 1.8 million people to leave the land they have called home and claim it for the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump outlined his thinking as he held talks with Netanyahu at the White House, where the two leaders also discussed the fragile ceasefire and hostage deal in the Israeli-Hamas conflict and shared concerns about Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think people should be going back," Trump said. “You can’t live in Gaza right now. I think we need another location. I think it should be a location that’s going to make people happy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the US would take ownership of the Gaza Strip and redevelop it after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere and turn the territory into “the Riviera of the Middle East" in which the “world's people” - including Palestinians - would live.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ll make sure that it’s done world class," Trump said. "It’ll be wonderful for the people - Palestinians, Palestinians mostly, we’re talking about.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt, Jordan and other US allies in the Mideast have cautioned Trump that relocating Palestinians from Gaza would threaten Mideast stability, risk expanding the conflict and undermine a decades-long push by the US and allies for a two-state solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Trump insists the Palestinians “have no alternative” but to leave the "big pile of rubble” that is Gaza. He spoke out as his top aides stressed that a three-to-five-year timeline for reconstruction of the war-torn territory, as laid out in a temporary truce agreement, is not viable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, both Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II dismissed Trump's calls to resettle Gazans.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said he believes Egypt and Jordan - as well as other countries, which he did not name - will ultimately agree to take in Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You look over the decades, it’s all death in Gaza,” Trump said. "This has been happening for years. It’s all death. If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what’s happening in Gaza.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he isn’t ruling out deploying US troops to support reconstruction of Gaza. He envisions “long-term” US ownership of a redevelopment of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Netanyahu is facing competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and for the 15-month conflict to end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. (Agencies)

    Nepal hikes Everest climb permit costs

<img alt="Fees for the peak spring climbing season will rise from US$11,000 to US$15,000 for a permit to scale the 8,849-metre peak. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790257_1_20250204210217.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nepal has hiked the cost of an Everest climbing permit by a third, arguing it will help tackle pollution and boost safety on the world's highest mountain, the tourism chief said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fees for the peak spring climbing season will rise from US$11,000 to US$15,000 for a permit to scale the 8,849-metre peak, Narayan Prasad Regmi, director general of the tourism department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cost had remained constant for a decade and it was high time to revise that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Costs of climbing at less popular – and more demanding – times of year such as during winter or the monsoon rains have also risen at similar rates, including from US$5,500 to US$7,500 during the autumn season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 peaks over 8,000 metres and welcomes thousands of climbers each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign climbers already spend tens of thousands of dollars in their attempt to climb Everest, with more than 400 purchasing permits last year, bringing in around US$4 million to government coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The funds are put towards cleaning trash from the mountain left by climbers as well as search and rescue operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mountaineering expedition companies hoped the price hike would not deter climbers, warning some might look to scale Everest through China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some climbers might shift to Tibet where the facilities are much better," said Mingma G Sherpa, who runs the Imagine Nepal mountaineering company, saying the fee must be spent on improving conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our government just increases the royalty, but doesn't do much," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It needs to also provide support to the climbers and guides."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nepal has been criticised for allowing too many climbers on Everest while doing little to keep the peak clean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the Nepal government ordered Everest mountaineers to carry mandatory trackers and carry bags to remove their excrement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fee increase was approved by the government in January, but was only published in the national gazette late on Monday. (AFP)

    'About 10' dead in Sweden's deadliest campus shooting

<div class="itemFullText">
 Around 10 people have been killed in a shooting at an adult education centre, Swedish police said, the deadliest attack to take place in Sweden on what the prime minister said was a "painful day" for the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gunman is believed to be among those killed and a search is continuing at the school for other possible victims, the local police chief told a press conference. The perpetrator's motive was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know that 10 or so people have been killed here today. The reason that we can't be more exact currently is that the extent of the incident is so large," local police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest said police believed the gunman had acted alone and that they did not currently suspect terrorism as a motive, though he cautioned that much remained unknown. He said the suspected gunman had not previously been known to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a big crime scene, we have to complete the searches we are conducting in the school. There are a number of investigative steps we are taking: a profile of the perpetrator, witness interviews ... Obviously, it's a significant amount of work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they had opened an investigation into murder, arson and an aggravated weapons offence and that the search for possible further victims had continued into the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooting took place in Orebro, some 200 kilometres west of Stockholm, at the Risbergska school for adults who did not complete their formal education or failed to get the grades to continue to higher education. It is located on a campus that also houses schools for children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a very painful day for the whole of Sweden," Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My thoughts are (also) with all of those whose normal school day was turned into fear. Being locked up in a classroom fearing for your life is a nightmare no one should have to experience." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Global space agencies are closely monitoring a building-size space rock that has a tiny chance of hitting Earth seven years from now.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA) estimate that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, is around 40 to 100 metres wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ESA said it has an almost 99 percent chance of safely passing Earth on December 22, 2032, but a possible impact could not be entirely ruled out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Astronomy expert, Professor Quentin Parker from the University of Hong Kong, said if the asteroid hits Earth, it would cause a devastating impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like a 10 megaton nuclear explosion on that city. But the likelihood is, given that two-thirds of the Earth's surface is water, it'll go into the ocean... creating a small tsunami, which actually could be quite dangerous to landfall around where that occurred," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it hits in a desert, or in an unpopulated region, it'll devastate the surrounding region up to maybe several tens of kilometres in terms of graded damage from the epicentre to the edge where the damage is completely catastrophic at the impact site, then drops off as you get further away."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said there are still many unknowns and scientists could make more accurate estimations when the asteroid comes closer to Earth again in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard to study because it has a very elliptical orbit. It goes very far away and comes close. You can only study when it comes close. When it comes close again in 2028, we'll be able to refine the orbit again even further," Parker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's nothing we can do in terms of sending out a rocket at the moment to deflect it."
  <br>
  <br>
  The asteroid now stands at the top of the ESA's asteroid risk list and Nasa's automated Sentry risk list, which include any known asteroids with a non-zero probability of colliding with Earth.

<div class="itemFullText">
 El Salvador's leader has made the offer to jail Americans sent by their own country, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  There is virtually no precedent in contemporary times for a democratic country to send its own citizens to foreign jails, and any attempt to do so is sure to be challenged in US courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Rubio welcomed an offer to do just that by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, whose sweeping crackdown on crime has won him soaring popularity at home and hero status for many in US President Donald Trump's orbit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has offered to house in his jails dangerous American criminals in custody in our country, including those with US citizenship and legal residency," Rubio told reporters in San Salvador.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country's ever made an offer of friendship such as this," Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are profoundly grateful. I spoke to President Trump about this earlier today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said that Bukele was also willing to take back Salvadoran citizens as well as nationals of other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio appeared to suggest that the prison transfer would focus on members of Latin American gangs, such as El Salvador's MS-13 and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, who have acquired US citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal -- MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be -- he has offered his jails," Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since his return to the White House last month, Trump has put a top priority on speeding up the deportation of millions of people in the United States without legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has sought to crack down on the right to birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the US Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also unveiled plans to detain 30,000 migrants at the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- a prison which previous Democratic presidents hoped to close. (AFP)

    'China's approach to tariffs contrasts with the US'

<img alt="Analysts believe any potential Chinese countermeasures against US tariffs would be related to the military and tech sectors. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790179_1_20250204102142.jpg&q=20">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A political commentator said China’s move to file a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over the Trump administration's tariff threats aims to create a contrast to the US's practice of dealing with things.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump had announced a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports on top of existing duties, a measure which was supposed to take effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump held out the prospect of a deal with an announcement on Monday that talks between Beijing and Washington on tariffs would happen within "the next 24 hours".
  <br>
  <br>
  Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme that Beijing is "colouring within the lines of the international order" by turning to the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, the US has not allowed any appellate judges to be appointed since the Obama administration. That means that they can't render a final decision," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I think China is trying to create a stark contrast between what it's willing to do and Donald Trump who seems to... he likes colouring outside the lines. He likes to be brash, bold. He likes to threaten people. And though he generally will pivot on a dime if things aren’t going well, it's still a very marked contrast between two different responses."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Beijing has yet to impose any countermeasures, Tangen believes they could be related to military and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, China has a very large position in the rare earths area, it's indicated before, and has imposed some restrictions on that. You have to register to get some of the... rare earths and things like that. And they said they're not going to export them for military use. And I see that probably is where they're going to concentrate," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Regina Ip said Hong Kong has to be more flexible in dealing with incoming challenges, saying the fact that Mexico and Canada were able to delay the imposition of tariffs on their goods underlines the importance of engaging with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the one hand, you need to engage. On the other hand, you need to strengthen yourself and have an arsenal of tools to respond if necessary," Ip told RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has much less leverage being only an SAR. But we have full backing from our country. I think we need to be more nuanced and be more flexible in our approach when we deal with these sort of great power threats."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip, who chairs the New People's Party, said people doing business in the Hong Kong are more concerned about interest rates than tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want interest rates to come down to lessen the debt burden on many of our investors, including property tycoons. The continued trend of lowering interest rates would spur our economic growth. We hope the [US Federal Reserve] would resume the downward trend of interest rates if a trade war could be avoided," she said.

    Trump says he's pausing tariffs on Canada after talks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump delayed the start of tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month on Monday after America's neighbours struck last-minute deals to tighten border measures against the flow of migrants and the drug fentanyl.
 <br>
  <br>
  Global stock markets had slumped as Trump's threat of sweeping 25 percent levies on exports from Canada and Mexico to the United States sparked fears of a global trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after calls with Trump just hours before the US tariffs were due to take effect, both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum struck deals for a postponement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said that after "very friendly" talks with Sheinbaum he'd "immediately pause" the tariffs on Mexico, and that his counterpart had agreed to send 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico frontier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions appeared higher between the US and Canada, but after two separate calls Trump later said he was "very pleased" and was announcing a 30-day halt in the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Canada has agreed to ensure we have a secure Northern Border, and to finally end the deadly scourge of drugs like Fentanyl that have been pouring into our Country," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks on final deals would continue with both countries, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said after the "good call" that Canada deploy nearly 10,000 frontline officers to help secure the border, list drug cartels as terrorists, appoint a "Fentanyl Czar" and crack down on money laundering.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear the real extent of the changes on the Canadian border, given that just this December authorities there said they already had 8,500 personnel deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  China remains in the firing line for Trump tariffs. It faces a further 10 percent duty on top of existing levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president said last-minute talks between Washington and Beijing will likely be held "probably in the next 24 hours" to avoid new tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, China and Mexico are the United States's three biggest trading partners, and Trump's threatened tariffs have sent shock waves through the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's three main indices fell sharply in early deals, but clawed back ground after Trump's announcement on the Mexico deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a trade war, this is a drug war," National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC, complaining that "the Canadians appeared to have misunderstood the plain language."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, US government figures show that only a minimal quantity of drugs comes via Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada had vowed to respond strongly to the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its most populous province Ontario on Monday had banned US firms from bidding on tens of billions of dollars in government contracts -- and dumped a deal with Trump ally Elon Musk's Starlink.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has upped the pressure recently by calling Canada's existence into question -- once again calling on Monday for it to become the 51st US state.
  <br>
  <br>
  A political crisis in the Canadian government over Trump's tariff threats led to Trudeau announcing earlier this month that he would quit too. Canadians now face elections as early as April.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president -- who has said that tariff is the "most beautiful word in the dictionary" -- is going even further in his second term on the levies than he did in his first.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has insisted that the impact would be borne by foreign exporters without being passed on to American consumers, despite most experts saying the contrary.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the billionaire 78-year-old did acknowledge as he returned from a weekend at his Florida resort Sunday that Americans might feel economic "pain".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also wielded tariffs as a threat to achieve his wider policy goals, most recently when he said he would slap them on Colombia when it turned back US military planes carrying deported migrants. (AFP)

    Musk says Trump 'shutting down' US aid agency

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk, the world's richest person and US President Donald Trump's controversial close advisor, said on Monday the giant USAID humanitarian agency will be "shutting down" as part of his drive to shrink the US government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hours later, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated it was not disappearing but would come under his control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the acting director of USAID," Rubio told reporters on a visit to El Salvador, accusing the agency of "insubordination."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid confusion over the future of the US Agency for International Development, employees were instructed by email not to go to their offices Monday. Some 600 staffers found themselves locked out of their computer systems, ABC News reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID is the aid arm of US foreign policy, funding health and emergency programs in around 120 countries, including the world's poorest regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also seen as a source of soft power for US foreign policy, which Musk accused of being "corrupt" and involved in an array of political activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SpaceX and Tesla CEO, who has massive contracts with the US government and was the biggest financial backer of Trump's campaign, said he had personally cleared the unprecedented move with the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I went over with him in detail, and he agreed that we should shut it down," Musk said in a discussion on his X online platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Musk's aides have taken control of the US Treasury Department's payments system - which manages trillions of dollars of transactions each year -- sparking alarm among critics. (AFP)

    Trump confirms one-month 'pause' in Mexico tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump paused tariffs on Mexico for one month after last-minute talks on Monday, but there was no breakthrough yet in negotiations with Canada on an issue that has sparked fears of a global trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  As world markets slumped, Trump and his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum both announced the halt in the levies after she agreed to send 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border following talks on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on his Truth Social network that after the "very friendly conversation" he had "agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period."
  <br>
  <br>
  During that time there would be further talks "as we attempt to achieve a 'deal' between our two Countries," the Republican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leftist Sheinbaum had announced the tariff pause a few minutes earlier, saying she had a "good conversation with President Trump with great respect for our relationship and sovereignty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump agreed to increase measures to prevent trafficking of US weapons into Mexico, she said, a point that did not appear in Trump's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development came hours before the 25 percent levies that Trump has ordered on imports from the US neighbors and chief trading partners, plus an extra 10 percent on China, were due to take effect at midnight on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had also spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday and was due to speak again, but the White House said negotiations with Ottawa were not going as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump repeated his frequent claims that the United States is being unfairly treated by trade while pushing his argument that the tariffs were about a "drug war" from opioids "pouring through the Borders of Mexico and Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  US government figures show that only a minimal quantity of drugs comes via Canada. (AFP)

    Greece's Santorini on alert after seismic activity

<img alt="Dust rises following a landslide during high seismic activity on Santorini. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790129_1_20250203220204.jpg&q=10">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Schools were closed and emergency crews deployed on the volcanic Greek island of Santorini on Monday after a spike in seismic activity raised concerns about a potentially powerful earthquake.
 <br>
  <br>
  Precautions were also ordered on several nearby Aegean Sea islands – all popular summer vacation destinations – after more than 200 undersea earthquakes were recorded in the area over the past three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a very intense geological phenomenon to handle,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said from Brussels, where he was attending a European meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to ask our islanders first and foremost to remain calm, to listen to the instructions of the Civil Protection (authority)."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mobile phones on the island blared with alert warnings about the potential for rock slides, while several earthquakes caused loud rumbles. Authorities banned access to some seaside areas, including the island's old port, that are in close proximity to cliffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These measures are precautionary, and authorities will remain vigilant,” Civil Protection Minister Vasilis Kikilias said late on Sunday following an emergency government meeting in Athens. “We urge citizens to strictly adhere to safety recommendations to minimise risk.”
  <br>
  <br>
  While Greek experts say the quakes, many with magnitudes over 4.5, are not linked to Santorini’s volcano, they acknowledge that the pattern of seismic activity is cause for concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government officials met with scientists throughout the weekend and on Monday to assess the situation, while schools were also ordered shut on the nearby islands of Amorgos, Anafi and Ios.
  <br>
  <br>
  The frequency of the quakes, which continued throughout Sunday night and into Monday, has worried residents and visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have never felt anything like this and with such frequency – an earthquake every 10 or 20 minutes. Everyone is anxious even if some of us hide it not to cause panic, but everyone is worried," said Michalis Gerontakis, who is also the director of the Santorini Philharmonic Orchestra.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We came out yesterday and performed. Despite the earthquakes, the philharmonic performed for a religious occasion,” Gerontakis said. "When you are playing, you cannot feel the quakes but there were earthquakes when we were at the church. No one can knows what will happen. People can say whatever they like, but that has no value. You cannot contend with nature.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents and visitors were advised to avoid large indoor gatherings and areas where rock slides could occur, while hotels were instructed to drain swimming pools to reduce potential building damage from an earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire service rescuers who arrived on the island on Sunday set up yellow tents as a staging area inside a basketball court next to the island's main hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We arrived last night, a 26-member team of rescuers and one rescue dog," said fire brigadier Ioannis Billias, adding that many residents, including entire families, spent the night in their cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some residents and local workers headed to travel agents seeking plane or ferry tickets to leave the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve had earthquakes before but never anything like this. This feels different," said Nadia Benomar, a Moroccan tour guide who has lived on the island for 19 years. She bought a ferry ticket Monday for the nearby island of Naxos.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I need to get away for a few days until things calm down,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others said they were willing to take the risk. Restaurant worker Yiannis Fragiadakis had been away but said he returned to Santorini on Sunday despite the earthquakes.

  “I wasn’t afraid. I know that people are really worried and are leaving, and when I got to the port it was really busy, it was like the summer," Fragiadakis said. "I plan to stay and hopefully the restaurant will start working (for the holiday season) in three weeks.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The highly anticipated trial of Spain's disgraced former football chief Luis Rubiales over the forced kiss he gave star forward Jenni Hermoso began on Monday with the player scheduled to take the stand.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old provoked worldwide outrage after he cupped Hermoso's head and gave her an unsolicited kiss after Spain beat England to win the 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are seeking two and a half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales and Hermoso did not greet each other as they arrived at the National Court in San Fernando de Henares near Madrid for the trial scheduled to run until February 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The kiss was given "unexpectedly and without the consent or acceptance of the player", prosecutors wrote in their indictment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Constant and repeated pressure was exerted directly on the player Jennifer Hermoso and through her family and friends with the aim of justifying and publicly approving the kiss that Luis Rubiales gave her against her will," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales is scheduled to take the stand on February 12. He has called the kiss an innocuous "peck between friends celebrating" and denied any coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the accused alongside Rubiales are ex-women's national team coach Jorge Vilda and two former federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stand accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them. (AFP)

<img alt="Investors around the world and in Asia are coming to terms with the sobering implications of the Trump administration's tariff salvo against Canada, Mexico and China. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790078_1_20250203135559.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investors bought dollars, sold stocks and fretted about inflation on Monday in a scramble to assess the risk of a trade war after Donald Trump put tariffs on top US trading partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's orders for additional levies of 25 percent on imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, as well as 10 percent on goods from China are light on detail.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they kick in on Tuesday and have jolted markets that had assumed Trump was mostly bluff and bluster.
  <br>
  <br>
  The selloff extended beyond just Canadian and Mexican markets and stocks directly in the line of fire, to cryptocurrencies, stocks and even the safe-haven Japanese yen, as investors tried to second-guess the volatile president's next moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Worries about the hit to growth from the inflationary impact of the wide-ranging tariffs and the uncertainty that creates for the Federal Reserve played a part, causing everything but the dollar and long-term US Treasuries to be sold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump's trade war has started," said Alvin Tan, head of Asia currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore, noting it was hard to see the US dollar retreating any time soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dollar has been the main mover, gaining as Trump headed for and then won office because investors figured tariff-hit countries would weaken their currencies to offset the impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the euro fell 1.3 percent on fears Europe may be next on the tariff list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's dollar skidded to a 20-year low on the greenback, China's yuan slid in offshore trade, oil jumped, metals slumped and US equity futures dropped about two percent on risks to US companies' bottom lines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the tariffs may cause "short term" pain for Americans, and while he would speak on Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, which have announced retaliatory tariffs of their own, he downplayed expectations that they would change his mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said equity bulls are re-evaluating their Trump trades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equity bulls seduced by 'Trump is good for equities' narrative are subject to a rude wake-up call from the potentially jarring impact on growth/earnings amid retaliatory tariff spirals," Mizuho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul and Taipei made losses around two percent in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  European stock futures slid 2.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has linked the tariffs to the flow of migrants and drugs - particularly fentanyl - into the US and demanded crackdowns in Canada, China and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Mexico have said fentanyl is America's problem, so prospects of a breakthrough are unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said it would challenge Trump's tariffs at the World Trade Organisation and take unspecified countermeasures. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beyoncé won Album of the Year for “Cowboy Carter” at the 2025 Grammys, delivering her — at last — the show’s elusive top award.
 <br>
  <br>
  The superstar, who is both the most awarded and nominated artist in Grammys history, has been nominated in the category four times before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the Los Angeles Fire Department presented Beyoncé with the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s been many, many years,” Beyoncé said in her speech. “I want to dedicate this to Ms Martell,” she said, referencing Linda Martell, the performer who became the first Black woman to play the Grand Ole Opry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The singer also emerged with the award for best country album for “Cowboy Carter."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kendrick Lamar's culture-shifting diss track "Not Like Us" on Sunday took home the Grammy for Record of the Year, beating popular tracks from a crew of pop heavyweights to claim the prestigious prize.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chappell Roan won the 2025 best new artist Grammy award on Sunday, beating out fellow nominees including popular "Espresso" singer Sabrina Carpenter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among her hits, "Hot to Go!", helped cement her status as one of 2024 up and coming artists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I told myself that if I ever got to stand up here in front of the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels and the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists offer a liveable wage," Roan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She expressed her own experience as a minor that was signed by a record label and eventually dropped from that contract, leaving her unable to afford health insurance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We (music artists) got you, but do you got us?" she added
  <br>
  <br>
  Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, known professionally as Chappell Roan, was nominated in six Grammy categories this year, including song of the year for "Good Luck, Babe!" (Reuters)
