<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday said that Germany rejects "outsiders intervening in our democracy," a day after US Vice President JD Vance in a blistering speech told Europe to open the door to far-right parties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholz, who faces elections on February 23, spoke in Munich where Vance on Friday launched his broadside against Germany and the EU on immigration, free speech and other topics in a speech later praised by US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance also met Alice Weidel, the top candidate of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has also received strong backing from technology billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Scholz pushed back against Vance's speech and defended Germany's taboo against cooperating with extremist parties, often dubbed a "firewall."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not accept outsiders intervening in our democracy, in our elections," Scholz said. "That is not appropriate – especially not among friends and allies."
  <br>
  <br>
  France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also defended European policies after Vance's speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Freedom of expression is guaranteed in Europe," Barrot said on X, after Vance alleged it was "in retreat." "Nobody is obliged to adopt our model, but nobody can impose theirs on us," the French minister added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz started his speech by mentioning Vance's earlier visit to the Nazis' Dachau concentration camp near Munich, and the US vice president's commitment to "never again" allow such crimes to be committed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Holocaust was the reason "the vast majority of Germans are firmly opposed to those who glorify or justify" the Nazis, Scholz said, recalling that AfD senior figures have trivialised Nazi crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A commitment to 'never again' cannot be reconciled with support for the AfD," Scholz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later stressed that "we are absolutely clear that the extreme right should stay outside the political decision-making process and that there would be no cooperation with them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance had criticised Germany for excluding parties that voice strong concerns over immigration and argued that "democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no room for firewalls," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash between the traditional allies comes just over a week before German national elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz's centre-left Social Democrats are currently third in the polls at around 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race is being led by the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, whose support stands at around 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AfD is expected to score its best-ever national result, now polling in second place at around 20 percent. (AFP)

    Zelensky calls for creation of European army

<img alt="Ukraine's president tells the Munich Security Conference that Europe needs its own army. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791790_1_20250215191907.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday Ukraine would never accept any peace deal reached behind its back or without Kyiv's involvement – an implicit message to US President Donald Trump as he strives to end the war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech to the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky also called on Europe to create its own armed forces, urging the continent's leaders to decide their own future and saying Ukraine's armed forces alone were not enough for their security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky spoke after Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, the first between US and Russian leaders since Russia's February 2022 full-scale assault on Ukraine, and said he and Putin expected to meet in the future, probably in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has repeatedly said it wants to come together with the United States and Europe to devise a joint strategy before any Trump-Putin meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration so far has left the impression among some European allies that it was making concessions to Putin at Ukraine's expense before any negotiations begin, though remarks by some top US officials have raised confusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky predicted that the Kremlin would try to persuade Trump to attend Russia's May 9 commemorations in Moscow, when it marks the Soviet victory in World War Two with an annual military parade through Red Square.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky told the conference that he believed it would be "dangerous" if Trump met Putin before he and Trump meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  To Europe's leaders, he issued warnings, asking rhetorically whether their armies would be ready if Moscow launched an open or "false-flag" attack. The latter is designed to look like it was perpetrated by someone other than the group responsible for it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If this (Ukraine-Russia) war ends the wrong way, he (Putin) will have a surplus of battle-tested soldiers who know nothing but killing and looting," he said, citing intelligence reports saying Russia will dispatch its troops to Belarus this summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And now, as we fight this war and lay the groundwork for peace and security, we must build the Armed Forces of Europe." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged Nato to adopt a "rational and pragmatic" attitude and establish an "objective and correct understanding" of China, the foreign ministry said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the comment to Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte on Friday, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Beijing will continue to work with other parties to play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier at the conference, the top diplomat said China will work with like-minded countries to promote a stable and orderly multi-polar world as well as an inclusive and tolerant economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted that China maintains a consistent and stable policy toward the United States, which will continue to be guided by the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation. (Agencies)

    EU 'urgently' considering options to DRC fighting

<img alt="Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of Republic of Congo attends a meeting during the 38th Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791782_1_20250215173727.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU said on Saturday it was "urgently" considering all options in response to a widening rebel offensive in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, after Rwandan-backed forces seized a second major city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Having captured the key provincial capital of Goma last month, M23 fighters pushed south and took a vital airport before marching virtually unchecked into another key city, Bukavu, on Friday, according to security and humanitarian sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Alarmed by news of Rwandan backed M23 forces seizing Kavumu airport and entering Bukavu, ignoring international appeals for ceasefire," European Commission spokesman Anouar El Anouni wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EU urgently considers all the means at its disposal. The ongoing violation of the DRC's territorial integrity will not go unanswered."
  <br>
  <br>
  The warning comes as the conflict is set to dominate an African Union summit that opened on Saturday in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa with UN chief Antonio Guterres saying a regional escalation "must be avoided at all costs".
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows an appeal from the European Parliament, which this week urged the EU to suspend a minerals deal with Rwanda in response to Kigali's involvement in the offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers in Strasbourg on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a non-binding resolution which also called for the bloc's 27 member states to freeze all direct budget support as well as military and security assistance to Rwanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rwanda denies giving military support to the M23 but has accused extremist Hutu groups in DR Congo of threatening its security.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report by UN experts said last year Kigali maintained around 4,000 troops in DR Congo and had de facto control of the rebel group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conflict has killed thousands and driven vast numbers from their homes. (AFP)

    3 Israeli hostages released, 369 Palestinians freed

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli hostages Iair Horn, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Sasha (Alexander) Troufanov arrived at a release site in Gaza on Saturday after Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped avert a standoff that threatened to sink a fragile ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters led the three onto a stage at the site in Gaza's Khan Younis, live footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three have been returned in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, a swap which eases fears that the agreement could collapse before the end of a 42-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas had earlier threatened not to release more hostages after it accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire by blocking aid from entering Gaza, drawing counter-threats of a resumption of fighting from Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emaciated appearance of three hostages released last week and accounts of abuse by other hostages released since January 19 when the ceasefire took effect has set off Israeli protests demanding that the government stick to the ceasefire and proceed with the next stage of the deal to bring all the hostages home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prospects for the ceasefire surviving have also been clouded by U.S. President Donald Trump's call for Palestinians to be moved permanently out of Gaza, and for the enclave to be turned over to the United States to be redeveloped. That call was strongly rejected by Palestinian groups, Arab states and Western allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce was intended to open the way for a second phase of negotiations to return remaining hostages and complete the withdrawal of Israeli forces before a final end to the war and the rebuilding of Gaza, which now lies largely in ruins, facing shortages of food, running water and electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas threat to hold off from releasing more hostages followed its accusation that Israel had blocked tents and temporary shelter materials from entering into Gaza, leaving tens of thousands exposed to the winter cold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel rejected the accusation, saying it had allowed thousands of aid trucks in. Hamas on Saturday said it expects Israel to meet its aid obligations for the ceasefire to stay on track. (Reuters)

    OpenAI board rejects Elon Musk-led buyout offer

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI's board chairman on Friday said it has unanimously rejected an Elon Musk-led offer to buy the hot artificial intelligence company for US$97.4 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  "OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition," chairman of the board Bret Taylor said in a statement posted by the company on Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI (artificial general intelligence) benefits all of humanity," the statement continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk filed court documents on Wednesday saying that he would withdraw the offer to buy OpenAI if its board returns the artificial intelligence pioneer to a non-profit "charity" model.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI currently operates a hybrid structure, as a non-profit with a money-making subsidiary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The change to a for-profit model, one that Altman considers crucial for the company's development, had exacerbated ongoing tensions with Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and Altman were among the 11-person team that founded OpenAI in 2015, with the former providing initial funding of US$45 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three years later, Musk departed the company, with OpenAI citing "a potential future conflict for Elon... as Tesla continues to become more focused on AI."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk established his own artificial intelligence company called xAI early in 2023 after OpenAI ignited global fervor over the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The massive costs of designing, training, and deploying AI models have compelled OpenAI to seek a new corporate structure that would give investors equity and provide more stable governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transition to a traditional for-profit company requires approval from California and Delaware authorities, who will scrutinize how the non-profit arm of OpenAI is valued when it becomes a shareholder in the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current investors prefer a lower valuation to maximize their share of the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics say Musk's bid, valuing the OpenAI non-profit at US$97.4 billion - approximately US$30 billion above the level in current negotiations, according to The Information - appears designed to disrupt the company's fundraising efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI's Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane has said Musk's offer came from a competitor "who has struggled to keep up with the technology and compete with us in the marketplace". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas fighters are will release three Israeli hostages on Saturday in exchange for 369 Palestinians in Israeli custody, the sixth swap of a truce that came close to collapse this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of violating the January 19 ceasefire, with the Palestinian group saying it would pause releases and Israel threatening the resumption of war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Friday both sides signalled that the hostage release scheduled for Saturday would go ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group said that Israel was to release 369 inmates in exchange, with 24 of them expected to be deported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority, 333 people, are "prisoners from the Gaza Strip who were arrested after October 7", the group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the crisis that appeared to bring the fragile truce to a breaking point, Hamas said on Friday it expected talks on a second phase of the ceasefire to begin early next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose country is Israel's top backer and has been involved in mediation efforts during the war, is due to arrive in Israel late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week's release sparked anger in Israel and beyond, with the emaciated state of the freed Israeli hostages sparking concern over conditions in captivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also fears for Palestinians in Israeli custody after some prisoners required medical treatment on their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire has been under massive strain since US President Donald Trump proposed a takeover of the Gaza Strip under which the territory's population of more than two million would be moved to Egypt or Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any forced displacement evokes memories of the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of their ancestors during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab countries have come together to reject the plan, and Saudi Arabia will host the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday for a summit on the issue. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Trump said on Friday that he planned to unveil tariffs on imported cars around April 2, adding to a cascade of levies he has threatened since taking office.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's statement did not specify whether the tariffs would apply to all auto imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since his inauguration on January 20, Trump has taken aim at allies and adversaries alike with threats of fresh duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has referred to tariffs as a way to raise revenue, remedy trade imbalances and pressure countries to act on US concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have warned that the tariffs will be passed on to American consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked when he might unveil auto tariffs, Trump said, "Maybe around April 2."
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not provide further details on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of the cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada and the other half from other major auto-producing countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latter group is led by Japan, South Korea and Germany, with Britain, Italy and Sweden a source of a smaller volume of imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent days, Ford CEO Jim Farley has blasted a proposed Trump tariff of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada, noting that it disadvantages US companies that have integrated their supply chains across North America under trade agreements, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) negotiated in the first Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  On February 3, the White House suspended the tariffs for 30 days following moves from Canada and Mexico on border security and fentanyl policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Levies targeting the auto sector would come after the president recently firmed up plans for tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports beginning March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has previously promised tariffs on semiconductors, steel, oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, in a move broadening trade conflicts, Trump launched plans for "reciprocal tariffs" that could hit all US trading partners on a country-by-country basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, has called for Trump to drop proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We support President Trump's efforts to consider the entire global trade situation, including both tariff and non-tariff barriers," said AAPC President Matt Blunt on Thursday in response to the announcement on reciprocal tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the meantime, Ford, GM, and Stellantis continue to believe that vehicles and auto parts that meet the USMCA requirements should not be subject to additional tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AAPC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. (AFP)

    Vance, Zelensky meet for talks to end war

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance pledged on Friday that Washington sought to secure a "lasting" peace as he held a first meeting with Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss Donald Trump's push for a deal with Moscow.
 <br>
  <br>
  The talks in Munich were seen as a key moment for Kyiv as it tried to keep Washington on its side after Trump stunned allies by announcing peace efforts with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to achieve a durable, lasting peace, not the kind of peace that's going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple of years down the road," Vance said as the meeting wrapped up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said "good conversations" had been had with Zelensky about how they could reach that goal, and they would have more talks "in the days, weeks, and months to come.".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky also hailed a "good conversation," saying the encounter with Vance was "our first meeting, not last, I'm sure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to move as quickly as possible towards a real and guaranteed peace," Zelensky wrote later on X, adding that an envoy from Washington would visit Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump rattled Ukraine and its European allies on Wednesday by agreeing to launch peace talks in his first publicly announced call with Putin since returning to office.
  <br>
  <br>
  After nearly three years of war of frosty relations, the dramatic thaw in US-Russia relations sparked fears that Ukraine could be left behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials have insisted that Zelensky will be involved in negotiations—and the Ukrainian leader said he would be prepared to sit down with Putin after agreeing to a "common plan" with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only in this case I'm ready to meet," Zelensky told the Munich Security Conference before seeing Vance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance said ahead of the meeting that the United States was prepared to pressure Russia, adding that Europe should "of course" be at the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also told Europe to "step up" on bolstering its own defence to allow Washington to focus on threats elsewhere in the world. (AFP)

    Drone damages outer shell of Chernobyl nuclear plant

<img alt="Ukraine said that a Russian drone had struck a cover built to contain radiation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791695_1_20250214213154.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A drone armed with a warhead hit the outer protective shell of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant on Friday, damaging the structure and briefly starting a fire, in an attack Kyiv blamed on Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin denied it was responsible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Radiation levels at the shuttered plant in the Kyiv region — site of the world's worst nuclear accident — have not increased, according to the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, which said the strike did not breach the plant's inner containment shell.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IAEA did not attribute blame, saying only that its team stationed at the site heard an explosion and was informed that a drone had struck the shell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting around nuclear power plants has repeatedly raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe during three years of war, particularly in a country where many vividly remember living through the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which killed at least 30 people and spewed radioactive fallout over much of the Northern Hemisphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is Europe’s biggest, has occasionally been hit by drones during the war without causing significant damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike came two days after US President Donald Trump upended American policy on Ukraine, saying he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move seemed to identify Putin as the only player that matters and looked set to sideline Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as European governments, in any peace talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said a Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead hit the plant's outer shell and started a fire, which had been put out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shell was built in 2016 over another heavy concrete containment structure, which was placed on the plant’s fourth reactor soon after the 1986 disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both shells seek to prevent radiation leaks. (AP)

    Japan to release emergency rice reserves

<img alt="A five-kilo bag was selling for 3,688 yen (US$24) in the last week of January, according to a government survey, up from 2,023 yen last year. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791673_1_20250214183636.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Japanese government on Friday said it would release a fifth of its emergency rice stockpile after hot weather, poor harvests and panic buying over a "megaquake" warning nearly doubled prices over a year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan has previously tapped into its reserves to cope with disasters, but this marked the first time since the stockpile was built in 1995 that it was doing so because of supply chain problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some supermarket shelves were emptied in August of rice following a week-long holiday, a series of typhoons and warnings of a looming major earthquake that has so far failed to materialise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had initially hoped prices would stabilise late last year once newly harvested rice arrived in stores, but inflation continued unabated, this time because some distributors were hoarding for fear of running out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Agriculture Minister Taku Eto told reporters on Friday the government would release 210,000 tonnes of rice from its stock of one million tonnes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope you will take this as our strong determination to improve at all costs the situation where distribution has been delayed and stuck," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice prices had already began to change consumption patterns for some like Tokyo resident Eriko Kato.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still do buy rice occasionally, but since it's so expensive I sometimes give up on buying it once I see the price," Kato, 41, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A five-kilogramme bag was retailing at 3,688 yen (US$24) in the last week of January, according to a government survey, up from 2,023 yen last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice consumption in Japan has more than halved in the past 60 years to about 50.9 kilos in 2022, but the grain remains deeply ingrained in Japanese culture and its harvesting has shaped the nation's landscape -- even being used in Shinto rituals. (AFP)

    Vance to clarify Trump Ukraine peace plan in Munich

<img alt="US Vice President JD Vance will meet Ukraine's president in Munich where the pair will discuss Washington's efforts to end the conflict between Kyiv and Moscow. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791648_1_20250214165245.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance will lead America's delegation to the Munich Security Conference that starts on Friday in the southern German city, where world leaders and diplomats are gathering amid intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration's foreign policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The future of Ukraine will be the top item on the agenda following a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, when they pledged to work together to end the three-year-old Russia-Ukraine conflict .
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday for talks that many — particularly in Europe — hope will shed at least some light on Trump’s ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was supposed to join them but was delayed when his Air Force plane had to return to Washington after developing a mechanical problem en route to Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Department said he would take a different aircraft, but it was unclear whether he would arrive in time for the meeting with Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who upended years of steadfast US support for Ukraine during his call with Putin on Wednesday, has been vague about his specific intentions — other than suggesting that a deal will likely result in Ukraine being forced to cede territory that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Ukraine war has to end,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “Young people are being killed at levels that nobody’s seen since World War II. And it’s a ridiculous war.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russia-Ukraine war is the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi will also be in Munich to communicate Beijing's position on global security.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Ukraine, state media cited Wang as saying China welcomes all efforts committed to peace talks and supports building a "balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people were killed and more than two dozen were injured when a blaze ripped through a hotel construction site in the South Korean port city of Busan on Friday, the National Fire Agency said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire started just before 11am local time at the construction site of the Banyan Tree Hotel, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 workers were present when the blaze erupted, a National Fire Agency official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-five people were injured, a public health department official said, adding that most were minor injuries caused by smoke inhalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fire had already reached its peak by the time we arrived and thick black smoke was covering the scene," Busan Gijang Fire Station chief Hong Mun-sik told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were many flammable materials blocking the entrance," Hong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out on the first floor of the building where workers had stored insulation materials, Hong said, and the fatalities occurred where the fire started.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The exact cause and location of the fire need to be thoroughly investigated," Hong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire was brought under control around 1.30pm. (AFP)

    Trump signs plan for reciprocal tariffs on US partners

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump inked plans on Thursday for sweeping "reciprocal tariffs" that could hit both allies and competitors, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said he had decided to impose reciprocal duties, telling reporters that US allies were often "worse than our enemies" on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’ve decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff," Trump said at the proclamation signing. “It’s fair to all. No other country can complain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, he called the European Union "absolutely brutal" in trade ties with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the memo Trump signed on Thursday, officials - including the US trade representative and commerce secretary - will propose remedies on a country-by-country basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick said that studies should be completed by April 1, and the president could start tariffs as early as April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the EU, the White House also flagged differences in certain US tariff levels with India and Brazil, while noting Japan's "high structural barriers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists caution that sweeping tariffs on US imports would likely boost inflation, not reduce it, in the near term and could weigh on growth eventually.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump acknowledged on Thursday that US prices "could go up" due to tariffs, but he expressed confidence that they would ultimately ease. (Agencies)

 US President Donald Trump greeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House with a bear hug on Thursday and called him “a great friend of mine," but nonetheless warned that India won't be spared from higher tariffs he's begun imposing on US trade partners around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who had previously derided India as the “tariff king,” called the import levies imposed by Modi's country “very unfair and strong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Whatever India charges, we charge them,” Trump said at a joint news conference where he stood next to Modi. “So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge.”
  <br>
  <br>
  As he has while recently hosting other foreign leaders, Trump talked about ensuring that the US erases its trade deficit with India. He suggested that could be done by increasing US energy exports to India but also promised to restore “fairness and reciprocity” to the economic relationship and said he and Modi had begun working on a major trade deal that could be completed later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and India have a trade deficit of US$50 billion in India’s favour. Goods and services trade between the two countries totalled around US$190.1 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to India’s External Affairs Ministry, US exports to India were worth nearly US$70 billion, and imports US$120 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi, the fourth world leader to visit the White House since Trump's return, described him as a friend and told him he was adopting a take on his "Make America Great Again" slogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining Trump's meeting with Modi was SpaceX and Tesla tycoon Elon Musk. Modi also met one-on-one with Musk, raising questions over whether the world's richest man was meeting the Indian leader in an official or business capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indian premier posted pictures of himself shaking hands with the beaming Musk, with several children on Musk's side of the room, and Indian officials on the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi, a prolific user of Musk-owned social media platform X, said later that he had known Musk before he became prime minister. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he wants to restart nuclear arms control talks with Russia and China and that eventually he hopes all three countries could agree to cut their massive defence budgets in half.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump lamented the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in rebuilding the nation's nuclear deterrent and said he hoped to gain commitments from Russia and China to cut their own spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There’s no reason for us to be building brand new nuclear weapons, we already have so many,” Trump said. “You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully much more productive," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said if the weapons were ever called to use, “that’s going to be probably oblivion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two countries once “we straighten it all out" in the Middle East and Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia. And I want to say, ‘let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I think we’ll be able to.” (Agencies)

    Vaccine critic RFK Jr sworn in as US health secretary

<div class="itemFullText">
 Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine critic who has pledged to tackle chronic disease, was named US Health Secretary on Thursday after overcoming resistance from the medical establishment and members of Congress with promises to limit his role in vaccination policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  As Kennedy was sworn into the post, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to "Make America Healthy Again," that would investigate chronic illness and deliver an action plan to fight childhood diseases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy said on Thursday his first priorities would be around "radical transparency" and removing those in the government who had conflicts of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 20 years, I've gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I could end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country. On August 23 of last year, God sent me President Trump," Kennedy said, referring to when he dropped his independent presidential bid and endorsed the Republican candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Senate earlier on Thursday voted to confirm Kennedy 52-48, with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the lone Republican joining all 47 Democrats to vote against Kennedy, who had made pledges to protect existing vaccination programmes in a bid to secure votes of hesitant lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy will now oversee multiple high-profile agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy, 71, is an environmental lawyer who has long sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevented millions of deaths for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will now run the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that directs more than US$3 trillion in healthcare spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also under HHS purview are the Medicare and Medicaid programmes that provide health insurance for over 140 million Americans and the National Institutes of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to pledging to work to end chronic disease, Kennedy has said he wants to break any ties between employees at the US drugs regulator and industry. (Reuters)

    Foreign Minister Wang Yi in UK for talks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Britain need to strengthen strategic communication, enhance mutual trust and demonstrate responsibility as major countries, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a meeting with the UK prime minister on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang is visiting London for a strategic dialogue with the British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, at which both sides agreed to speed up preparations for institutional dialogues on the economy and trade, health and industrial cooperation, the Foreign Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lammy hosted talks with Wang as the pair revived the China-UK Strategic Dialogue, a bilateral forum that was last held in 2018 before it stalled as relations soured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer "dropped in" to a meeting between Wang and UK National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell, a Downing Street spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer "underlined his intention to build a consistent and respectful relationship between the UK and China" and "reiterated that the UK will always engage frankly on the areas where our views differ," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides exchanged in-depth views on the Ukraine crisis, with Wang stressing "no expansion of the battlefields, no escalation of hostilities, and no fanning flames."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said China welcomed efforts committed to peace talks and supported the building of a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour government, elected in July, has sought to improve the UK's relationship with Beijing after the two countries fell out during the latter years of Conservative rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major thawing of tensions, Starmer and President Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit last November - the first bilateral meeting between leaders of the two countries since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance minister Rachel Reeves then visited China last month seeking investment to kickstart growth in Britain's economy, while Lammy visited Beijing in October. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge humpback whale briefly scooped a kayaker in its mouth in the seas off the coast of southern Chile before spitting him out unscathed in a dramatic incident caught on camera.
 <br>
  <br>
  The kayaker, Adrian Simancas, was out with his father last weekend in the seas off the town of Punta Arenas, when the whale surfaced and scooped him up in his mouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt like I was being lifted, but it was clearly too strong to be a wave," said Simancas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I turned, I felt something blue and white passing close to my face, like on one side and above. I didn't understand what was happening. Then everything... I went under and thought I had been swallowed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Luckily, the whale quickly spat out Simancas unharmed. His father, in another kayak, caught the whole thing on camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I turned on the camera and heard a wave crash behind me, loudly. When I turned, I didn't see anything," said his father, Dell Simancas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that was the only moment of real fear because I didn't see Adrian for about three seconds. Then he suddenly shot out without the packraft, and a second later, the packraft emerged, and then I saw the fin of something."
  <br>
  <br>
  Adrian Simancas was sure he was going to die during the ordeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought I was done for, that I was dead. It was like three strange seconds down there," he said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 German authorities said a driver drove a car into a labour union demonstration in central Munich on Thursday, injuring at least 28 people including children.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said it was believed to be an attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, an Afghan asylum-seeker, was arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident follows a series of attacks involving immigrants in recent months that have pushed migration to the forefront of the campaign for Germany’s February 23 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said on social media platform X that the driver was “secured” and no longer posed any danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  A damaged Mini could be seen at the scene, along with debris including shoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter said he was “deeply shocked” by the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said participants in a demonstration by the service workers’ union ver.di were walking along a street at about 10.30am when the car overtook a police vehicle following the gathering, accelerated and plowed into the back of the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers arrested the suspect after firing a shot at the car, deputy police chief Christian Huber said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bavarian capital will see heavy security in the coming days because of the three-day Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of international foreign and security policy officials, which opens on Friday. (AP)

    'Europe must be involved in Ukraine peace talks'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Several Nato allies stressed on Thursday that Ukraine and Europe must not be cut out of any peace negotiations, after US President Donald Trump signalled that he would hold talks soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
 <br>
  <br>
  “Let’s not forget, Russia remains a threat well beyond Ukraine,” British Defence Secretary John Healey said after the United States rattled Nato by saying that Ukraine should never join the alliance and that European allies should take responsibility for Ukraine's security going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine. And Ukraine’s voice must be at the heart of any talks,” Healey told reporters at Nato's headquarters, as the organisation’s 32 defence ministers met for talks on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swedish Defence Minister Pål Jonson said European nations provided about 60 percent of the military support to Ukraine last year and must be involved, especially given US demands that Europe take more responsibility for Ukraine's security in the longer term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s very natural that we’re engaged into the discussions,” Jonson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Estonian counterpart, Hanno Pevkur, underlined that the European Union has driven sanctions against Russia, has invested heavily in Ukraine’s defence, and will be asked to foot the bill for rebuilding the war-ravaged country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to be there. So there is no question about it. Otherwise this peace will not be long lasting,” Pevkur warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Ukraine’s Western backers on Wednesday that Nato membership for Ukraine was unrealistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia and instead prepare for a negotiated peace settlement to be backed up by international troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  After talks with Putin and then Zelenskyy, Trump said on Wednesday he would “probably” meet in person with the Russian leader soon, and suggested that the meeting could happen in Saudi Arabia. (AP)

    North Korea demolishing family reunion centre: Seoul

<img alt="South Koreans had met with their North Korean relatives during separated family reunions at the Mount Kumgang resort. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791443_1_20250213113318.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea is demolishing a venue that for decades hosted tearful reunions of families separated by the Korean War and the division of the country, Seoul said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reunions in the North's Kumgang mountain, last held in 2018, were a testament to the devastating human cost of the Korean peninsula's division.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the meetings were subject to the vagaries of inter-Korea politics and often used as a negotiating tool by Pyongyang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The demolition of the Mount Kumgang Reunion Center is an inhumane act that tramples on the earnest wishes of separated families," a spokesperson for Seoul's unification ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea "sternly urges an immediate halt to such actions" and "expresses strong regret".
  <br>
  <br>
  "North Korea's unilateral demolition cannot be justified under any pretext, and the North Korean authorities must bear full responsibility for this situation," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 1988, around 130,000 South Koreans have registered their "separated families".
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 2025, around 36,000 of those individuals are still alive, according to official data. Seventy-five percent say they do not know if their relatives are alive or dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some were lucky enough to be chosen to take part in occasional crossborder reunions, mostly hosted at the Mount Kumgang resort.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea has been escalating its rhetoric against its southern neighbour in recent years, designating the south as a "hostile state".
  <br>
  <br>
  Pyongyang also blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border last year, which prompted South Korea's military to fire warning shots at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, Pyongyang scrapped a 2018 military accord designed to curb the risk of inadvertent clashes between two countries that remain technically at war, prompting the South to take a similar step. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on Wednesday, and Trump ordered top US officials to begin talks on ending the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The conversations came after Trump's defence secretary earlier said Kyiv would have to give up its long-held goals of joining the Nato military alliance and regaining all of its territory seized by Russia, signalling a dramatic shift in Washington's approach to the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He wants it to end. He doesn't want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after speaking with Putin for more than an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we're on the way to getting peace. I think President Putin wants peace, President Zelenskiy wants peace and I want peace. I just want to see people stop getting killed," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long said he would quickly end the war in Ukraine, without spelling out exactly how he would accomplish this.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin earlier said Putin and Trump had agreed to meet, and Putin had invited Trump to visit Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said their first meeting would "probably" take place soon in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on his social media platform, he said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would lead negotiations on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Zelenskiy spoke after Trump's call with Putin, and Zelenskiy's office said the conversation lasted for about an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a meaningful conversation with @POTUS. We... talked about opportunities to achieve peace, discussed our readiness to work together ...and Ukraine's technological capabilities... including drones and other advanced industries," Zelenskiy wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  No Ukraine peace talks have been held since the early months of the conflict, now approaching its third anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  European powers, including Britain, France and Germany, said on Wednesday they had to be part of any future negotiations on the fate of Ukraine, underscoring that only a fair accord with security guarantees would ensure lasting peace. They said they were ready to enhance support for Ukraine and put it in a position of strength. (Reuters)

    South Korea's Yoon back in court in impeachment trial

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's ousted President Yoon Seok Yeol faces potentially his last impeachment hearing on Thursday over his failed martial law bid before judges begin deliberations on whether to formally remove him from office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former prosecutor has remained defiant through weeks of hearings at Seoul's Constitutional Court, blaming a "malicious" opposition for his December bid to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attempt only lasted six hours as the opposition-led parliament voted the declaration down, later impeaching him over his attempt to impose martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was detained last month on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ousted president arrived at the court at around 9am local time (0000 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's hearing is set to hear evidence from the former chief of South Korea's intelligence service and one of the heads of Seoul's Capital Defence Command, the military unit dispatched to the parliament during the short-lived martial law bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is widely expected – but not officially confirmed – to be Yoon's last hearing before the court's judges go behind closed doors to deliberate whether to uphold his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  That process could take over a week to a fortnight – formerly impeached Presidents Park Geun-hye and Roh Moo-hyun had to wait 11 and 14 days, respectively, to learn their fates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many legal scholars and experts agree that a unanimous ruling in favour of impeachment will be made by the Constitutional Court judges," said Kim Hyun-jung, a researcher at the Korea University Institute of Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But experts also warn that political wrangling could hold up the trial – prominent conservative supporters of Yoon have called for more hearings to be held.
  <br>
  <br>
  An additional judge could also be approved to the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench, which is currently one member short.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the court upholds the impeachment, an election must be held within 60 days to choose a new president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Yoon's impeachment trial has centred on the question of whether he violated the constitution by declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suggested last week that even if he had ordered the arrest of MPs to prevent them from voting down his decree, it would not legally matter because it had not been carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also facing a criminal trial on insurrection charges, for which he faces a prison sentence or the death penalty. (AFP)

    Elon Musk's X settles Trump lawsuit over ban: report

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's social media platform X has agreed to settle a lawsuit over what was then Twitter banning Donald Trump after the mob attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, a newspaper said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  X has agreed to pay about US$10 million to settle a lawsuit that Trump filed against Twitter and its former chief executive Jack Dorsey protesting his ban, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the now infamous insurrection, more than 140 police officers were injured in hours of clashes with pro-Trump rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twitter and other social media platforms removed Trump at the time due to concerns he would promote further violence with bogus claims that voter fraud caused his loss to Joe Biden in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  Billionaire Musk subsequently bought Twitter and renamed it X. Musk reinstated Trump on the platform and was a major Trump supporter during the recent presidential race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has made Musk head of a newly created Department of Government Efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta in January agreed to pay Trump US$25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit he filed claiming he was wrongfully censored by Facebook and Instagram after the US Capitol riot, according to the social media giant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta in the settlement will not admit wrongdoing over the suspensions of Trump's accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Meta confirmed the settlement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had widely criticised social media platforms for suspending his accounts after the January 6, 2021 insurrection and for comments he made that were seen as praising people engaged in the violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  After taking office in January, Trump granted pardons to more than 1,500 of his supporters who stormed the Capitol in a bid to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also ordered that all pending criminal cases against Capitol riot defendants be dropped. (AFP)

    Pentagon chief lays out red lines on Ukraine at Nato

<div class="itemFullText">
 New US defence chief Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday Washington would not deploy troops to Ukraine under any peace deal with Russia, and that Kyiv regaining all its land or joining Nato were not realistic goals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing a meeting of Kyiv's backers in Brussels, Hegseth laid out President Donald Trump's red lines and demands -- and told Europe to ramp up both support for Ukraine and spending on its own defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be US troops deployed to Ukraine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US defence chief said any peace process "must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective" -- although Washington, like Europe, wanted "a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine".
  <br>
  <br>
  And he warned that "the United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement".
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's allies have been waiting nervously for clarity from Trump's administration after the US president demanded that the transatlantic alliance more than double its defence spending target and vowed to end the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's two days of talks in Brussels are part of a flurry of visits to Europe by top US officials, culminating with Vice President JD Vance meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a security conference in Munich on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On both support for Kyiv and Europe's own defence spending, the Pentagon chief delivered the resounding message that Washington expects its allies to do more.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Safeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of Nato," Hegseth said. "Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth further warned that Washington would not accept what it considers "imbalanced" burden-sharing within the alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States remains committed to the Nato alliance and to the defence partnership with Europe, full stop," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency." (AFP)

    Egypt pushes back against Trump's Gaza plan

<div class="itemFullText">
 Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will not travel to Washington for talks at the White House as long as the agenda includes US President Donald Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza, two Egyptian security sources said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has infuriated the Arab world with a plan to permanently displace the population of more than 2 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, claim US control of it and turn it into the "Riviera of the Middle East".
  <br>
  <br>
  He has demanded Egypt and Jordan take in the Palestinians, and has threatened to withdraw aid from the two US-allied Arab states if they refuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt has said Trump had extended an open invitation to Sisi to visit the White House earlier this month. A US official said no date for such a visit has been set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian presidency and foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan's King Abdullah appeared uncomfortable during a meeting with Trump at the White House on Tuesday, at which Trump discussed his Gaza plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty visited Washington this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian sources said one aim of his trip was to avert a potentially awkward presidential visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Egyptian sources, it was made apparent to Abdelatty during a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the displacement plan would be on the table if Sisi visited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdelatty responded that such a meeting would be of no use, and that any discussion should be over Egypt's own plan for reconstruction of Gaza, the sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt has said its plan would "ensure Palestinians remain on their land". (Reuters)

    US detainee returns home after release by Russia

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said that another detainee would be freed on Wednesday, as he met Marc Fogel, who was released after being held in Russia since 2021.
 <br>
  <br>
  Describing the prisoner deal with Russia as "very fair, very reasonable," Trump said "somebody else is being released tomorrow" without providing details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schoolteacher Fogel, freed by Russia after three and a half years in prison, got a flag-waving welcome from Trump after a flight home from Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like the luckiest man on earth right now," said Fogel, an American flag draped around his shoulders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a middle-class school teacher who’s now in a dream world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, standing alongside Fogel in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, said: "To me he looks damned good."
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of 63-year-old Fogel, who had been detained in Russia since August 2021 and was serving a 14-year sentence, came as Trump seeks to improve relations with Moscow as part of an effort to secure an end to the Ukraine conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Fogel both thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just wanted to get him back home," Trump said, and said he would take Fogel on a tour of the Lincoln Bedroom upstairs in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fogel was released into the custody of Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who made an unannounced stop in Moscow on Tuesday to pick him up.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a plane home, Fogel, who is from Pennsylvania, was shown with a raised glass, a cheese plate and his US passport in a photo posted on social media by Trump's chief hostage envoy Adam Boehler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what the United States gave up in exchange for Fogel, Trump told reporters earlier: "Not much" and called the release a show of good faith from the Russians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were treated very nicely by Russia. Actually, I hope that's the beginning of a relationship where we can end that [Ukraine] war and millions of people can stop being killed," Trump said. (Reuters)

    White House bars AP over its 'Gulf of America' style

<img alt="The White House reportedly blocked an AP reporter from several events due to the news agency's insistence of using " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791300_1_20250212121655.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House Correspondents' Association protested a decision by the White House on Tuesday to bar an Associated Press (AP) reporter from an event with US President Donald Trump over the news agency's decision to continue referring to the Gulf of Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed an executive order in January directing the Interior Secretary to change the name to the Gulf of America.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The White House cannot dictate how news organisations report the news, nor should it penalise working journalists because it is unhappy with their editors' decisions," Eugene Daniels, president of the association, said on Tuesday in a statement posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the administration to bar a reporter from the Associated Press from an official event open to news coverage today is unacceptable," Daniels said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AP Executive Editor Julie Pace said in a statement earlier that its reporter had been blocked from attending an Oval Office event after being informed by the White House it would be barred unless it aligned its editorial standards with Trump's order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism," Pace said, adding that limiting access violated the First Amendment of the US Constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP says in its stylebook that the Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years and, as a global news agency, the AP will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most news organisations, including Reuters, call it the Gulf of Mexico although, where relevant, Reuters style is to include the context about Trump's executive order. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump on Tuesday pressed Jordan's King Abdullah to take in Palestinians who would be permanently displaced under the president's plan for the US to take over the Gaza Strip, even as the king said his country was firmly opposed to the move.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking alongside the Arab country's ruler in the White House, Trump implied he would not budge on his idea that involves moving the Gaza Strip's residents and transforming the war-ravaged territory into what he billed a "Riviera of the Middle East."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has infuriated the Arab world by saying that Palestinians would not be able to return to their homes under his proposal to redevelop the enclave, which has been devastated by an Israeli offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to take it. We're going to hold it, we're going to cherish it. We're going to get it going eventually, where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East," Trump said in the Oval Office, saying his plan would "bring peace" to the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  King Abdullah said later that he reiterated to Trump Jordan’s "steadfast position" against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, as well as in the occupied West Bank that borders his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the unified Arab position," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the views of his Jordanian counterpart, Trump said Jordan, as well as Egypt, would ultimately agree to house displaced residents of Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries rely on Washington for economic and military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Jordan. I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt," said Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We may have some place else, but I think when we finish our talks, we'll have a place where they're going to live very happily and very safely." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and around 60 other countries on Tuesday signed the final statement of a French-hosted artificial intelligence summit that said AI should be inclusive, open, ethical and safe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States and Britain did not sign the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The signatories agreed that the two-day summit laid out an open, multi-stakeholder and inclusive approach that will enable AI to be human rights-based, human-centric, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing told the summit that China was willing to work with other countries to safeguard security and share achievements in the field of artificial intelligence to build "a community with a shared future for mankind".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said AI has become an important driving force for the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and Beijing has always participated in global cooperation and governance on AI with a highly responsible attitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Vice President JD Vance said "massive regulations" by the European Union on AI could strangle the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry," Vance told the summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  A source close to organisers said they were not surprised that the US had not signed, considering their stance on regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UK government spokesperson said the final statement did not sufficiently address "harder questions around national security".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We felt the declaration didn't provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it," the spokesperson said. (Agencies)

    Altman dismisses Musk's OpenAI takeover bid

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a US$97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are not for sale,” Altman said on Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk’s bid, announced on Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a non-profit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created as a counterweight to Google's dominance in artificial intelligence, OpenAI got its initial funding from Musk, who invested US$45 million. Three years later, Musk departed OpenAI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Subsequent lawsuits revealed that OpenAI claimed Musk left after his attempts to become CEO or to merge the company with Tesla were rejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  After November 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT and created a global technology sensation, Musk began criticising the company, trolling it on social media for keeping its source code private and signing a widely publicised manifesto calling for a pause in AI development, even as he pursued his own AI projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August 2024, Musk refiled a lawsuit against OpenAI and its backer Microsoft, claiming the ChatGPT maker had betrayed its founding mission of benefiting the public good in favour of pursuing profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk later updated the lawsuit to prevent OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit company - a change Altman considers crucial for the company's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's San Francisco correspondent, Mark Niu, said Musk's bid appeared designed to disrupt the company's fundraising efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The latest reports are that the OpenAI board hasn't even seen that proposal. So it's hard to know what's going on. But there is a real feeling that among investors that Musk is really trying to... tie up things in the courts," said Niu. (AP, additional reporting RTHK)

    Israel threatens renewed 'intense' Gaza war

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared on Tuesday the ceasefire in Gaza would end and the military would resume fighting Hamas until it was defeated if the Palestinian militant group did not release hostages by midday on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Following Netanyahu's ultimatum, Hamas issued a statement renewing its commitment to the ceasefire and accusing Israel of jeopardising the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli announcement came after Netanyahu met with several key ministers, including defence, foreign affairs and national security, who he said gave the ultimatum their full support.
  <br>
  <br>
  After nearly 16 months of war, Hamas has gradually been releasing hostages since the first phase of a ceasefire began on January 19, but on Monday said it would not free any more until further notice over accusations Israel was violating the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon – the ceasefire will end and the IDF (military) will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear if Netanyahu meant Hamas should release all hostages held in Gaza or just the three who had been expected to be released on Saturday under the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, 16 of 33 hostages have been freed as part of the ceasefire deal's first phase that is due to last 42 days. Five Thai hostages were also let go in an unscheduled release.
  <br>
  <br>
  In exchange, Israel has released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including prisoners serving life sentences for deadly attacks and others detained during the war and held without charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are thought to be 76 hostages still held in Gaza, more than 35 of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli media. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's former football federation chief Luis Rubiales gives his highly-anticipated version of events on Tuesday in the trial over his forced kiss on Jenni Hermoso that sparked global outrage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case has riveted the country since opening on February 3 and has turned Hermoso into an icon of the fight against macho culture and sexism in sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales was forced to resign in disgrace in 2023 after kissing Hermoso on the lips following Spain's triumph at that year's Women's World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are seeking two-and-a-half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales, 47, has called the kiss a "peck between friends celebrating" and denied any coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to now he has attended hearings without intervening as a slew of witnesses testified at the National Court near Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hermoso told the opening day of the trial she felt "disrespected" after a non-consensual kiss that "should not happen in any social or work setting".
  <br>
  <br>
  Her teammates have described how she cried and felt "overwhelmed" following the incident, while her brother Rafael Hermoso has said she came under pressure to downplay the incident to save Rubiales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former women's team manager Jorge Vilda and two ex-federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque, are also due to take the stand on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales minimised the importance of the kiss on Hermoso at the time and defied calls for his resignation at an emergency federation meeting in August 2023, railing against "false feminism".
  <br>
  <br>
  He resigned in September that year after Fifa suspended him and Spanish prosecutors opened an investigation into alleged sexual assault. (AFP)

    Corruption charges dropped against New York mayor

<img alt="The US Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791145_1_20250211115242.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Justice Department on Monday ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, arguing in a departure from long-standing norms the case was interfering with the mayor’s ability to aid the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told prosecutors in New York they were “directed to dismiss” the bribery charges against Adams immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bove said the order was not based on the strength of evidence in the case, but rather because it had been brought too close to Adams re-election campaign and was distracting from the mayor’s efforts to assist in the Trump administration’s law-and-order priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime,” Bove wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo also ordered prosecutors in New York not to take “additional investigative steps” against the Democrat until after November's mayoral election, though it left open the possibility that charges could be refiled after that following a review.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intervention and reasoning — that a powerful defendant could be too occupied with official duties to face accountability for alleged crimes — marks a striking deviation from long-standing justice department norms.
  <br>
  <br>
  An attorney for Adams, Alex Spiro, said the justice department’s order had vindicated the mayor’s claim of innocence.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Now, thankfully, the mayor and New York can put this unfortunate and misguided prosecution behind them," said Spiro, who has also represented Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case against Adams was brought under the previous US attorney for the district, Damien Williams, who stepped down before Trump became president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo follows months of speculation that Trump would take steps to end the case against Adams, who was charged in September with accepting bribes of free or discounted travel and illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals seeking to buy his influence. (AP)

    Google complies with orders to rename 'Gulf of Mexico'

<img alt='Google Maps users in the United States will see the "Gulf Mexico" renamed as "Gulf of America" in compliance with White House executive orders.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Google on Monday changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to "Gulf of America" for those using its Maps platform inside the United States, complying with an executive order by President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tech giant wrote in a blog post that users outside the United States will continue to see both the original and new name for the Gulf of Mexico, as is the case for other disputed locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People using Maps in the US will see 'Gulf of America,' and people in Mexico will see 'Gulf of Mexico.' Everyone else will see both names," Google wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google said the change aligns with its policy of following official US government geographic designations through the Geographic Names Information System.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon taking office, Trump signed executive orders not only changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico but also reverting the name of Denali, America's highest peak, to its former moniker Mt. McKinley.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2015, then-president Barack Obama officially recognised the Alaska mountain as Denali, the name used by Alaska Natives for centuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's renamings sparked criticism from indigenous groups in Alaska, who have long advocated for maintaining the Denali name, and raised diplomatic concerns with Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has cheekily suggested calling the United States "Mexican America," pointing to a map from before one-third of her country was seized by the United States in 1848. (AFP)

    Trump declares paper straws 'don't work'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump is moving to reverse a federal push away from plastic straws, declaring that paper straws don't last very long.
 <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,” Trump said on Monday as he signed an executive order to review federal purchasing policies that restrict plastic straws.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move by Trump - whose 2019 re-election campaign sold Trump-branded re-usable plastic straws - targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump declared President Joe Biden’s policy “DEAD!” in a social media post over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said he thinks "it's okay” to continue using them.

  “I don’t think that plastic is going to affect the sharks very much as they’re... munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also complained that paper straws "don't work".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode. If something's hot, they don't last very long, like a matter of minutes, sometimes a matter of seconds." Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Straws are just the beginning,” Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. "Back to Plastic is a movement we should all get behind.”
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.
  <br>
  <br>
  Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tonnes of new plastic. About 40 per cent of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea last year but didn’t reach an agreement. (Agencies)

    US slaps 25 percent tariffs on steel, aluminum

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump substantially raised tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Monday to a flat 25 percent "without exceptions or exemptions", although he agreed to consider an exemption on Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a telephone call with Australia’s prime minister on Tuesday that took place before the tariff rise, Trump said the US trade surplus with Australia was one of the reasons he was considering an exemption.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We actually have a surplus," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about trade with Australia. “It’s one of the only countries which we do. And I told (Albanese) that that’s something that we’ll give great consideration to.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia had an exemption from such tariffs during Trump’s first administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed proclamations raising the US tariff rate on aluminium to 25 percent from his previous 10 percent rate and eliminating country exceptions and quota deals as well as hundreds of thousands of product-specific tariff exclusions for both metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminium to be "smelted and cast" within the region to curb US imports of minimally-processed metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he signed the order at the White House, Trump said he would follow Monday's action with announcements about reciprocal tariffs on all countries that impose duties on US goods over the next two days, and said he was also looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about threats of retaliation by other countries against his new tariffs, Trump said: "I don't mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's tariffs almost immediately drew criticism from Canada, the largest source of steel imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, called Trump a destabilising force in the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the proclamations, shares in US steel and aluminium makers jumped, while shares in European and Asian steelmakers fell. The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and industry data. (Agencies)

    Trump pauses work at US consumer protection agency

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Elon Musk (right) and Republicans have long accused the independent agency of overreach. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791097_1_20250211035951.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration has informed staff at the country's consumer protection agency that it is temporarily shuttering its headquarters and pausing all work, according to an email shared on Monday with AFP.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was set up in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis and is tasked with protecting American consumers from corporate misconduct.
  <br>
  <br>
  It serves as a watchdog over a variety of consumer issues ranging from mortgages to credit cards to debt collection, and has long been a target of Republican lawmakers and industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the message to staff, acting CFPB director Russell Vought said the agency's Washington office would be closed this week, and told employees not to show up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Please do not perform any work tasks," said Vought, Trump's new director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and a key architect of the conservative plan known as Project 2025 to reform the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vought added that staff would need to seek written permission from him before doing any urgent work going forward, and should otherwise "stand down from performing any work task."
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans have long accused the independent agency of overreach, with some of Trump's most ardent supporters, including the tech billionaire Elon Musk, calling for its closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union representing CFPB employees filed two lawsuits against Vought on Sunday, accusing him of trying to shut down the agency -- which was created by Congress, and of giving the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to employees' personal information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vought's actions reflected "an unlawful attempt to thwart Congress's decision to create the CFPB to protect American consumers," the National Treasury Employees Union argued in one of the lawsuits.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFPB "has long functioned as another woke, weaponized arm of the bureaucracy that leverages its power against certain industries and individuals disfavored by so-called 'elites,'" the White House said in a statement published on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the administration of President Donald J. Trump, the weaponization ends right now," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to pause all work at CFPB and close down its offices appears to be an attempt to curtail its oversight powers without shuttering it entirely, something that would require congressional approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress built the CFPB, and no one other than Congress, not the president, not Musk, not Vought, can shut it down," Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who helped create the agency, said in a video message.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement, Democrats including Warren announced plans for a protest outside the CFPB's Washington offices for Monday, to "sound the alarm" against Musk and Vought's "attempt to kill" the agency. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian group Hamas said it will delay the release of more Israeli hostages planned for Saturday until further notice, according to a statement by the group’s spokesperson on Telegram.
 <br>
  <br>
  Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Qassam Brigades, said, “During the past three weeks, the resistance leadership has monitored the enemy’s violations and failure to abide by the terms of the agreement, including delaying the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, and targeting them with shelling and gunfire.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We affirm our commitment to the terms of the agreement as long as the occupation commits to them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday they completed their fifth hostage-prisoner exchange, with three Israeli hostages and 183 Palestinian prisoners released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz called the announcement by Hamas a "complete violation" of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said Palestinians would have no right of return to Gaza under his US takeover plan, describing his proposal in excerpts of an interview released on Monday as a "real estate development for the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told Fox News Channel's Bret Baier that "I would own it" and that there could be as many as six different sites for Palestinians to live outside Gaza under the plan, which the Arab world and others in the international community have rejected. (Agencies)

    World leaders debate AI challenges at Paris summit

<div class="itemFullText">
 Political and tech industry leaders descended on Paris on Monday for a two-day summit on artificial intelligence, hoping to find common ground on the revolutionary technology set to remake business and society across the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the summit aims to lay the groundwork for governing the nascent sector, as global powers race to play leading roles in the fast-developing technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's meeting of around 1,500 guests in the French capital's opulent Grand Palais will feature lectures and panel discussions outlining the promises of and challenges posed by AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Political leaders, including US Vice President JD Vance and Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, are set to rub shoulders with the likes of OpenAI boss Sam Altman and Google chief Sundar Pichai.
  <br>
  <br>
  A largely suit-wearing crowd of men and women speaking languages from all over the world gathered under the glass-and-steel dome of the great hall, built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selected companies, academics and non-profit groups were showing off their work with AI at stands around the cavernous space decked out with screens and geodesic domes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two years on from the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, able to respond to all kinds of natural-language prompts, "artificial intelligence fuels both immense hopes and, at times, exaggerated fear," Macron's AI envoy Anne Bouverot told guests as she opened the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  She promised a "turning point" that would bring more countries on board with AI development that until now has been restricted to a few advanced economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on the agenda is "sustainable development" of the resource- and energy-hungry technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know that AI can help mitigate climate change, but we also know that its current trajectory is unsustainable," Bouverot said. (AFP)

<img alt="Leftist candidate Luisa Gonzalez will compete in the run-off in April to try to unseat the incumbent Daniel Noboa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791001_1_20250210125151.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ecuador will choose its next president in a presidential run-off election after conservative incumbent Daniel Noboa and leftist lawyer Luisa González garnered enough votes on Sunday to beat 14 other candidates.
 <br>
  <br>
  The contest will be a repeat of the October 2023 snap election that earned Noboa a 16-month presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runoff election is set for April 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing supporters in Quito, Gonzalez hailed her stronger-than-expected showing against the conservative incumbent as a "victory" for the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures released by Ecuador’s National Electoral Council after 66 percent of ballots were tallied showed Noboa received more than 3.09 million votes, or 44.7 percent, while González earned over 3.02 million votes, or 43.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of Sunday's candidates promised voters to reduce the widespread crime that has plagued the country in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighbouring Colombia and Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  So many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses were a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years can turn Ecuador around or if Noboa deserves more time in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ecuador’s National Electoral Council reported that more than 83 percent of the roughly 13.7 million eligible voters cast ballots. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador. (Agencies)

    Trump at Super Bowl in first for sitting US president
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790989_1_20250210120317.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Bowl extravaganza was watched by a star-studded 65,719 crowd bristling with celebrities and VIPs headed by Donald Trump, who became the first sitting US president to attend the event after jetting into New Orleans from Florida on Air Force One earlier in the day following a round of golf with Tiger Woods.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has had an uneasy relationship with the NFL over the years, triggering uproar in 2017 after attacking players for kneeling in protest against racial injustice during renditions of the US national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the US leader was given a broadly positive reception at the Superdome after arriving at the venue shortly before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after arriving, Trump met with first responders and family members of victims of the January 1 attack in New Orleans that left 14 people dead and dozens wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, loud cheering could be heard among the crowd when the Superdome's giant screen showed Trump saluting during the national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  That warm applause was in stark contrast to the booing that rang around the venue early in the first quarter when the same screen showed pop icon Taylor Swift sitting in the VIP seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, expressed hope the nation could come together for the Super Bowl, which is by far the biggest annual event on the American sporting calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Football is America's most popular sport -- for good reason -- it fosters a sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together and strengthening communities," Trump said in a statement released by the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swift, watching boyfriend and Chiefs ace Travis Kelce, was among a galaxy of stars crowded into the venue, with the likes of Beatles legend Paul McCartney rubbing shoulders with Hollywood actors Kevin Costner, Paul Rudd and Anne Hathaway and soccer star Lionel Messi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The catcalls for Swift -- who backed Trump's opponent Kamala Harris in last year's election -- were not lost on the US President.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later shared a post on his TruthSocial network which read: "Trump gets massive cheers at the Super Bowl while Taylor Swift gets booed - the world is healing!" (AFP)

    Lamar entertains at Super Bowl with dig at Drake

<img alt="Kendrick Lamar was the main performance during the Super Bowl halftime show. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790985_1_20250210113933.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Kendrick Lamar entertained a packed stadium crowd and audiences around the world watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, teasing and then delivering his ubiquitous, Grammy-winning diss track "Not Like Us."
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Superdome in New Orleans, Lamar was introduced by actor Samuel L Jackson dressed in a top hat as Uncle Sam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dancers in all white, all red and all blue piled out of a Buick Grand National GNX, the car that inspired the name of Lamar's recent album "GNX."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Lamar spun through "Squabble Up," "DNA" and other hits before telling a group of female dancers: "I want to perform their favourite song, but you know they want to sue."
  <br>
  <br>
  A few beats of "Not Like Us" played, but Lamar switched to a duet of "Luther" with R&B singer SZA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" is part of a long-standing feud between Lamar and Canadian musician Drake, and there had been speculation that Lamar might skip the song at the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake filed a defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group, saying the song's false accusation that he is a paedophile has put him and his family in danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lamar went for it. At one point, he omitted the word "paedophiles" - opting instead for a scream - but included a line about seeking "A minor" in which the crowd sang along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" won five Grammy Awards a week ago, bringing Lamar's lifetime total to 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamar's appearance on the biggest stage in music followed big names from Beyonce to Prince, Madonna, Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Super Bowl typically draws more than 100 million live US viewers, the largest TV audience of the year. (Reuters)

    Trump to announce new steel, aluminium tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25-percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States, on top of existing metals duties, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And very simply, it's, if they charge us, we charge them," Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said that while the US government would allow Japan's Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management," Trump said of US Steel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former president Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump's announcement what would happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80 percent in 2019 after Trump's initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China's global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of steelmakers in Asia mostly fell on Monday, save for those with operations in the United States. The US dollar rose and US Treasury yields ticked higher. (Agencies)

    Netanyahu says Israel to follow up on Trump Gaza plan

<img alt="Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking on Fox News. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790931_1_20250209211442.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed US President Donald Trump's widely criticised plan to move Palestinians out of the war-battered Gaza Strip, saying Israel is willing to "do the job".
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Fox News interview aired late on Saturday as the premier was wrapping up a visit to Washington, Netanyahu defended Trump's proposal, which has sparked concern and condemnation across the Middle East and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that President Trump's proposal is the first fresh idea in years, and it has the potential to change everything in Gaza," Netanyahu said, adding that it represents a "correct approach" to the future of the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All Trump is saying, 'I want to open the gate and give them an option to relocate temporarily while we rebuild the place physically'," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump "never said he wants American troops to do the job. Guess what? We'll do the job," Netanyahu declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel seized the Gaza Strip in 1967 and maintained a military presence in the territory until 2005, when it pulled out settlers and its troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  It subsequently imposed a crippling blockade on the Hamas-ruled territory and placed it under siege after the war began in October 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and armed groups in Gaza have fought several wars in recent years, but the latest -- sparked by the unprecedented 2023 Hamas attack on Israel -- has been the deadliest and most destructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said Trump's plan was a departure from the "same old, same old, same old -- we leave, Gaza becomes again occupied by these terrorists who use it as a base to attack Israel... It doesn't go anywhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we should pursue it," he added, cautioning that "the real issue" was finding a country that would agree to take in displaced Gazans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli leader also said that relocated Palestinians would have to "disavow terrorism" to be allowed to return to Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any attempts to force them out of Gaza would evoke dark memories of what the Arab world calls the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of Palestinians during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody describes Gaza as the biggest open-air prison in the world," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get the population out, allow them to leave. Not forcible eviction, not ethnic cleansing -- getting people out of what all these countries and all these do-gooders say is an open-air prison. Why are you keeping them in prison?" (AFP)

    Lebanon forms first new government in over 2 years

<img alt="The new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has vowed to reform Lebanon’s judiciary and battered economy. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790854_1_20250209024624.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lebanon’s new prime minister on Saturday formed the country’s first full-fledged government since 2022.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Joseph Aoun announced in a statement that he had accepted the resignation of the former caretaker government and signed a decree forming the new government with new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salam, a diplomat and former president of the International Court of Justice, vowed to “restore confidence between citizens and the state, between Lebanon and its Arab surroundings, and between Lebanon and the international community” and to implement reforms needed to bring the country out of an extended economic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Reform is the only path to a true salvation,” he said in a speech on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also promised to follow up on the implementation of a ceasefire agreement that ended the most recent war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group and political party Hezbollah in late November and to ensure that Israeli forces “withdraw from Lebanese territory until the last inch.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He pledged to ensure reconstruction in areas that suffered destruction during the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salam’s cabinet of 24 ministers, split evenly between Christian and Muslim sects, was formed less than a month after he was appointed and comes at a time when Lebanon is scrambling to rebuild its battered southern region and maintain security along its borders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though Hezbollah did not endorse Salam as prime minister, the group did engage in negotiations with the new prime minister over the Shiite Muslim seats in government, as per Lebanon’s power-sharing system.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was despite comments by US envoy Morgan Ortagus, who said in a speech in Beirut Friday that Washington had “set clear red lines from the United States” and that Hezbollah would not be “a part of the government.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments drew backlash from many in Lebanon who saw them as meddling in internal Lebanese affairs. (AP)

    US judge blocks Musk's team from Treasury data

<img alt="Demonstrators gather to protest Elon Musk's access to the Treasury's payment system. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790843_1_20250208214205.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A US judge issued an emergency order early on Saturday blocking Elon Musk's government reform team from accessing personal and financial data stored at the Treasury Department, court documents showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  US District Judge Paul A Engelmayer's order restricts giving access to Treasury Department payment systems and other data to "all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department."
  <br>
  <br>
  The temporary restrictive order, which remains in effect until a February 14 hearing, also says any such person who has accessed data from the Treasury Department's records since Donald Trump was inaugurated as president on January 20 must "immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, the world's richest person, is leading Trump's federal cost-cutting efforts under the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was brought against Trump, the Department of the Treasury and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday by attorneys general from 19 states.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attorneys general alleged the administration violated the law by expanding access to sensitive Treasury Department data to staff from Musk's Doge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Engelmayer's order said the states that sued would "face irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief."
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk ran into controversy last week with reports he and his team were accessing sensitive data stored at the Treasury Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  An internal assessment from the Treasury called the Doge team's access to federal payment systems "the single biggest insider threat the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has ever faced," US media reported. (AFP)

    Baltic nations disconnect from Russian power grid

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three Baltic states on Saturday cut ties with Russia's power grid to join the European Union's network, the culmination of a years-long process that gained urgency with Moscow's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – all former Soviet republics now in the European Union and Nato – had wanted to block Russia's ability to geopolitically blackmail them via the electricity system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have removed any theoretical possibility of Russia using energy (grid) control as a weapon," Lithuania's Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas – Estonia's former prime minister – had on Friday hailed the grid switch as "a victory for freedom and European unity."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vaiciunas said the Baltic states had completed the disconnection process at 9:09 local time (0709 GMT) on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been waiting for this moment for a long time," he told reporters, after speaking with his Estonian and Latvian counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The energy system of the Baltic states is finally in our own hands. We are in control," he added of the "historic" moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Baltics were now operating in so-called "isolated mode" before they integrate with the European grid on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official celebrations are planned across the Baltics, and authorities were on guard for any potential cyber-attacks linked to the grid switch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Latvia will physically cut a power line to Russia later on Saturday and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is to attend a ceremony with Baltic leaders in Vilnius on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Baltics have long prepared to integrate with the European grid but faced technological and financial issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The switch became more urgent after Russia started its war in Ukraine in 2022, spooking the Baltic states into thinking they could be targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  They stopped purchasing Russian gas and electricity after the war began, but their power grids remained connected to Russia and Belarus, controlled by Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  This left them dependent on Moscow for a stable electricity flow, which is crucial for factories and facilities requiring a reliable power supply. (AFP)

    Hamas frees three Israeli hostages in fifth Gaza swap

<img alt="Hamas fighters parade the hostages on stage before handing them over to the Red Cross. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790834_1_20250208193004.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas released three Israeli hostages on Saturday, the fifth group freed under a fragile Gaza ceasefire, with Israel condemning their "cruel" handover and worrying physical appearance.
 <br>
  <br>
  With Israel expected to release 183 prisoners in exchange, witnesses in the occupied West Bank saw a bus carrying freed Palestinians leave an Israeli jail and later arrive in the city of Ramallah.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth exchange since the truce took effect last month comes as negotiations are set to begin on a more permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came after President Donald Trump floated a proposal for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip and clear out its inhabitants, sparking global outrage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami and Eli Sharabi, who were all seized by militants during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the 15-month war, "crossed the border into Israeli territory," the Israeli military said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jubilant crowds in Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv cheered as they watched live footage of the three hostages, flanked by masked gunmen, brought on stage in Deir el-Balah before being handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the joy of their release was quickly overtaken by concern for their condition, with all three appearing thin and pale.
  <br>
  <br>
  The choreographed handover included forced statements from the three on stage, in which they stated support for finalising the next phases of the Israel-Hamas truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The disturbing images... serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt – there is no time to waste for the hostages! We must get them all out," said the Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose dejected-looking image appeared on a banner at the Deir el-Balah handover site, said that the images out of Gaza were "shocking."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's President Isaac Herzog denounced the treatment of the hostages who were paraded on stage, calling it "a crime against humanity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole world must look directly at Ohad, Or, and Eli – returning after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained – being exploited in a cynical and cruel spectacle by vile murderers," Herzog said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharabi, 52, was at his home in Kibbutz Beeri with his British-born wife and their two daughters when militants stormed it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The armed men shot their dog, before locking the family in their safe room and setting it on fire. The bodies of his wife and two daughters were later identified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ben Ami, who has dual Israeli-German citizenship, turned 56 in captivity. He was abducted from his home in Beeri along with his wife, who was released during the war's first truce in November 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival, where gunmen murdered his wife.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former hostage Yarden Bibas, who was freed last week by Hamas militants in Gaza, on Friday urged Netanyahu to help bring back his wife and two children from the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prime Minister Netanyahu, I'm now addressing you with my own words... bring my family back, bring my friends back, bring everyone home," Bibas said in his first public message following his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas previously said his wife Shiri and his two sons Ariel and Kfir – the youngest hostages – were dead, but Israel has not confirmed their deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hostage and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government on Friday to stick with the Gaza truce, even as Trump's comments sparked backlash across the Middle East and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An entire nation demands to see the hostages return home," the Israeli campaign group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time to ensure the agreement is completed – until the very last one," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian militants have so far freed 21 hostages in exchange for hundreds of mostly Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, aims to secure the release of 11 more hostages during the first 42-day phase of the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire were set to begin on Monday, but there have been no details on the status of the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu's office said that after Saturday's swap, an Israeli delegation will head to Doha for further talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second phase aims to secure the release of more hostages and pave the way for a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  During their October 2023 attack, militants took 251 hostages to Gaza. Seventy-three remain in captivity, including 34 whom the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliation has killed at least 47,583 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The United Nations considers the figures reliable. (AFP)

 A key Indian opposition leader and the former chief minister of the capital province Delhi lost his seat in local elections on Saturday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party tipped for victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arvind Kejriwal lost his seat to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), according to election commission results, reflecting expected wider losses by his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has governed the sprawling megacity of more than 30 million people for most of the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi's BJP is in government in the national parliament, but has not controlled the local legislature in the capital New Delhi since 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chanting BJP supporters danced in joy outside its New Delhi headquarters as vote results from the election on Wednesday were counted, waving flags and posters of Modi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Counting continues -- with the AAP and BJP level on nine declared seats -- but the election commission say Modi's party is leading in more than two-thirds of the 70-seat assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our victory is a sign of the people's faith in Prime Minister Modi's vision of progress," interior minister and BJP stalwart Amit Shah said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Delhi mandate shows that people can't be misled with lies every time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kejriwal, who rode to power as an anti-corruption crusader a decade ago, spent several months behind bars last year on accusations his party took kickbacks in exchange for liquor licences, along with several fellow party leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kejriwal has denied wrongdoing and characterised the charges as a political witch hunt by Modi's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was one of the key pillars of an opposition block formed ahead of India's general elections last year, when the BJP suffered significant losses despite holding on to power. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States added fewer jobs than expected in January; although hiring remained healthy, government data showed on Friday, marking resilience in the labour market heading into President Donald Trump's new term.
 <br>
  <br>
  Total employment rose by 143,000 jobs last month, according to the Labor Department, significantly lower than the revised 307,000 figure in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The January number was also below an analyst consensus estimate of 155,000, according to Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the jobless rate edged down to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent, beating analyst expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wage growth was better than analysts expected, accelerating to 0.5 percent, the report showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data added to signs that the US economy remained in excellent shape heading into Trump's second term, which began on January 20, analysts noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, took aim at downward revisions to last year's figures in the latest update, telling media that the Trump administration has "a lot of work to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taken together, December and January payroll figures paint a strong picture of the economy," added Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they expect that with these figures, the US central bank would not be in a rush to cut interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sectors like health care, retail trade, and social assistance saw job gains, the Labour Department said, while employment declined in industries like mining, alongside oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists warned that businesses may reconsider further hiring due to heightened tariff risks and Trump's plans to slow immigration. (AFP)

    Trump says to announce 'reciprocal' tariffs next week

<img alt="Donald Trump made tariffs a key platform of his presidential campaign. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790769_1_20250208043942.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Friday he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week, a major escalation of his trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the announcement during a meeting with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump did not identify which countries would be hit but suggested it would be a broad effort that could also help solve US budget problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said auto tariffs remained on the table amid reports that the White House was weighing potential exemptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll be announcing that, next week, reciprocal trade, so that we're treated evenly with other countries," Trump said. "We don't want any more, any less."
  <br>
  <br>
  The move would fulfil Trump's campaign promise to impose tariffs on American imports equal to rates that trading partners impose on American exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told Republican lawmakers of his plans during budget discussions at the White House on Thursday, three sources familiar with the plan told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and top aides have said they plan to use higher tariffs on foreign imports to help pay for extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which independent budget analysts say could add trillions of dollars to the US debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Increased tariffs could offset some of that cost, though they have only accounted for about 2 percent of annual revenues in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced tariffs of 25 percent on Canada and Mexico on Saturday but delayed them after a negative reaction from investors. The two largest US trading partners agreed to increase enforcement efforts at the border, a top Trump priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street extended losses on Friday following the Reuters report of Trump's discussion with lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  US consumer sentiment dropped to a seven-month low in February, and attitudes soured among Republicans as households took stock of what they believe will be a surge in inflation from Trump's tariffs. (Reuters)

    London's Grenfell Tower to be taken down after fire

<img alt='A UK public inquiry last year found the 72 deaths were "all avoidable." File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790752_1_20250207225504.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Grenfell Tower – where 72 people died in 2017 in Britain's worst residential fire since World War II – is to be demolished, the UK government confirmed on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move, which is expected to take two years, has angered some survivors and families of those killed in the massive inferno, which destroyed the 24-storey block in the west of Britain's capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Grenfell Tower will be carefully taken down to the ground," the government said in a statement, confirming what victims' groups said on Thursday they had been told.
  <br>
  <br>
  The work will start after the eighth anniversary of the blaze on June 14 and will be done carefully to ensure that materials can be included in any future memorial, the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said safety was the primary reason for the demolition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It remains stable because of the measures put in place to protect it, but even with the installation of additional props, the condition of the building will continue to worsen over time," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Engineers also advise it is not practicable to retain many of the floors of the building in place as part of a memorial that must last in perpetuity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire started in a faulty freezer, spreading rapidly due to highly combustible cladding fixed to the building's exterior.
  <br>
  <br>
  A public inquiry last year found the 72 deaths were "all avoidable" and blamed the "systematic dishonesty" of building firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also revealed decades-long government and regulatory failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the inquiry and report, victims' groups have criticised the government for failing to implement fire safety recommendations swiftly enough, including removing similar cladding from other buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Families have also condemned the delay in bringing criminal charges against those blamed for the disaster in the inquiry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to demolish the building divided victim groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell United, which represents some of the survivors and families, said on Thursday the decision was "disgraceful" and that victims were ignored by a short consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Grenfell Next of Kin said it was a "sensitive decision" that "came after a thorough engagement process" and was informed by "safety concerns" surrounding the structural integrity of the scaffolded remains of the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government insisted that deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, who also holds the housing brief, has offered the community several discussions online and in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear from conversations it remains a sacred site. It is also clear that there is not a consensus about what should happen to it," the government said in its statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being able to see the tower every day helps some people continue to feel close to those they lost. For others, it is a painful reminder of what happened and is having a daily impact on some members of the community." (AFP)

 China on Friday said it "regrets" Panama's decision to withdraw from the Belt and Road Initiative, after the Latin American nation ended its participation in the project in a concession to Washington.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing regrets Panama's decision," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, urging Panama to "consider the broader bilateral relationship and the long-term interests of both nations" and "resist external interference".
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin added that China firmly opposes the United States' actions to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation through pressure and coercion. (Xinhua/AFP)

    ICC condemns sanctions by Trump administration

<img alt="Israel has praised US sanctions on the International Criminal Court which issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu over his role in the Gaza war. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790687_1_20250207155955.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Criminal Court (ICC) on Friday called on its member states to stand up against sanctions imposed by US President Donald Trump, saying the move was an attempt to “harm its independent and impartial judicial work.”
 <br>
  <br>
  The White House issued the executive order on Thursday in response to what it called “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was referring to the arrest warrant the ICC issued last year for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hague-based court said it “condemns” the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Court stands firmly by its personnel and pledges to continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world,” the court said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We call on our 125 States Parties, civil society and all nations of the world to stand united for justice and fundamental human rights,” it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel on Friday praised Trump for imposing sanctions on the ICC, calling the court's actions against Israel "immoral" and illegitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday authorised economic and travel sanctions targeting people who work on ICC investigations of US citizens or American allies such as Israel, repeating the action he took during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move coincided with a visit to Washington by Israel's Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu, who - along with his former defence minister and a leader of Palestinian militant group Hamas - is wanted by the ICC over the war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions include freezing any US assets of those designated and barring them and their families from visiting the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 125-member ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression against the territory of member states or by their nationals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed the executive order after US Senate Democrats last week blocked a Republican-led effort to pass legislation setting up a sanctions regime targeting the war crimes court. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran on Friday condemned as "illegal" and "unjustified" new financial sanctions by the United States that target a network accused of shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian crude oil to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The decision of the new US government to exert pressure on the Iranian nation by preventing Iran's legal trade with its economic partners is an illegitimate, illegal and violative measure," foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US move was "categorically unjustified and contrary to international rules", Baqaei added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of the Treasury on Thursday announced financial sanctions against an international network "facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars" to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The oil was shipped on behalf of Iran's Armed Forces General Staff and a sanctioned front company called Sepehr Energy Jahan Nama Pars, the treasury department wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions came after US President Donald Trump reinstated his "maximum pressure" policy against Iran over allegations the country is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran has slammed the reinstatement of the policy -- similar to one Trump levied against Tehran during his first term as president -- saying pursuing it would end in "failure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the tough policy of sanctions during Trump's first term, which ended in 2021, Washington withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal that had imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the deal -- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- until a year after Washington pulled out, but then began rolling back its commitments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to revive the 2015 deal have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Wednesday called for a "verified nuclear peace agreement" with Iran, adding that it "cannot have a Nuclear Weapon".
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran insists its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes and denies any intention to develop atomic weapons. (AFP)

    Fentanyl fatality rate 'higher in Canada than US'

<img alt="Edmonton, in Canada, holds an Overdose Awareness Day. File photo (AFP)" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790650_1_20250207093916.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fentanyl is killing more people per capita in Canada than in the United States, Ottawa's public safety minister said on Thursday, calling the two nations "connected" in combating the opioid crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has accused Canada of not doing enough to counter the flow of fentanyl across their shared border, and cited the issue as justification for his threatened import tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has committed to addressing those concerns, while maintaining that less than one percent of fentanyl in the United States comes from Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On per capita population, we're losing more Canadians than Americans are losing Americans," Public Safety Minister David McGuinty told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are connected with this crisis."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US estimates, an average of 205 Americans have died each day of opioid overdoses in recent years, mostly from fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada has seen 21 deaths per day, according to the latest data, but its population is about 12 times smaller than that of its southern neighbour.

  McGuinty's remarks came after he met with senior federal police and border agency officials "to operationalise" a US$900 million border security plan launched in response to Trump's tariffs threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25 percent tariffs - which Trump has also said were necessary to force action to stem migrant crossings - were scheduled to take effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the president granted Canada a 30-day reprieve to allow for further talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the last-minute deal to put off the tariffs, the prime minister agreed to name a point person to lead the fight against fentanyl. (AFP)

 A judge on Thursday paused a scheme masterminded by billionaire Elon Musk to slash the size of the US government by encouraging federal workers to quit through a mass buyout.
 <br>
  <br>
  The federal judge in Massachusetts ordered a temporary injunction on the plan's deadline - midnight Thursday - given by Musk for the country's more than two million government employees. The offer was to quit with eight months' pay or risk being fired in future culls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadline is now extended to Monday, when US District Judge George O'Toole will hold a hearing on the merits of the case brought by labour unions, US media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, the world's richest person and President Donald Trump's biggest donor, is in charge of a free-ranging entity called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, more than 40,000 staff have so far accepted the buyout deal - a relatively small number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unions representing some 800,000 civil servants and Democratic members of Congress are resisting the scheme and have challenged the legality of threats to fire civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the broader budget cutting campaign has already severely disrupted departments and agencies that for decades have run everything from education to national intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID, the government's agency for distributing aid around the world, has been crippled, with foreign-based staff ordered home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also repeatedly said he wants to shut down the Department of Education. The inducements to resign have further been extended to the CIA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt told reporters that federal workers should "accept the very generous offer" of a deferred resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said "competent" replacements would be found for those who "want to rip the American people off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the controversies swirling around the Musk plan is how much access the South African-born tycoon is getting to secret government data, including the Treasury's entire payment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg TV on Thursday that there was "a lot of misinformation" and that access to such data was only given to two Treasury employees who are working with Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent said those employees had "read-only" access, meaning they couldn't change the data. (AFP)
