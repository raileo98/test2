<img alt='A UK public inquiry last year found the 72 deaths were "all avoidable." File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790752_1_20250207225504.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Grenfell Tower – where 72 people died in 2017 in Britain's worst residential fire since World War II – is to be demolished, the UK government confirmed on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move, which is expected to take two years, has angered some survivors and families of those killed in the massive inferno, which destroyed the 24-storey block in the west of Britain's capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Grenfell Tower will be carefully taken down to the ground," the government said in a statement, confirming what victims' groups said on Thursday they had been told.
  <br>
  <br>
  The work will start after the eighth anniversary of the blaze on June 14 and will be done carefully to ensure that materials can be included in any future memorial, the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said safety was the primary reason for the demolition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It remains stable because of the measures put in place to protect it, but even with the installation of additional props, the condition of the building will continue to worsen over time," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Engineers also advise it is not practicable to retain many of the floors of the building in place as part of a memorial that must last in perpetuity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire started in a faulty freezer, spreading rapidly due to highly combustible cladding fixed to the building's exterior.
  <br>
  <br>
  A public inquiry last year found the 72 deaths were "all avoidable" and blamed the "systematic dishonesty" of building firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also revealed decades-long government and regulatory failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the inquiry and report, victims' groups have criticised the government for failing to implement fire safety recommendations swiftly enough, including removing similar cladding from other buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Families have also condemned the delay in bringing criminal charges against those blamed for the disaster in the inquiry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to demolish the building divided victim groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell United, which represents some of the survivors and families, said on Thursday the decision was "disgraceful" and that victims were ignored by a short consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Grenfell Next of Kin said it was a "sensitive decision" that "came after a thorough engagement process" and was informed by "safety concerns" surrounding the structural integrity of the scaffolded remains of the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government insisted that deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, who also holds the housing brief, has offered the community several discussions online and in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear from conversations it remains a sacred site. It is also clear that there is not a consensus about what should happen to it," the government said in its statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being able to see the tower every day helps some people continue to feel close to those they lost. For others, it is a painful reminder of what happened and is having a daily impact on some members of the community." (AFP)

 China on Friday said it "regrets" Panama's decision to withdraw from the Belt and Road Initiative, after the Latin American nation ended its participation in the project in a concession to Washington.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing regrets Panama's decision," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, urging Panama to "consider the broader bilateral relationship and the long-term interests of both nations" and "resist external interference".
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin added that China firmly opposes the United States' actions to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation through pressure and coercion. (Xinhua/AFP)

    ICC condemns sanctions by Trump administration

<img alt="Israel has praised US sanctions on the International Criminal Court which issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu over his role in the Gaza war. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790687_1_20250207155955.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Criminal Court (ICC) on Friday called on its member states to stand up against sanctions imposed by US President Donald Trump, saying the move was an attempt to “harm its independent and impartial judicial work.”
 <br>
  <br>
  The White House issued the executive order on Thursday in response to what it called “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was referring to the arrest warrant the ICC issued last year for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hague-based court said it “condemns” the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Court stands firmly by its personnel and pledges to continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world,” the court said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We call on our 125 States Parties, civil society and all nations of the world to stand united for justice and fundamental human rights,” it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel on Friday praised Trump for imposing sanctions on the ICC, calling the court's actions against Israel "immoral" and illegitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday authorised economic and travel sanctions targeting people who work on ICC investigations of US citizens or American allies such as Israel, repeating the action he took during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move coincided with a visit to Washington by Israel's Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu, who - along with his former defence minister and a leader of Palestinian militant group Hamas - is wanted by the ICC over the war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions include freezing any US assets of those designated and barring them and their families from visiting the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 125-member ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression against the territory of member states or by their nationals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed the executive order after US Senate Democrats last week blocked a Republican-led effort to pass legislation setting up a sanctions regime targeting the war crimes court. (Agencies)

<img alt="Tehran has denounced the latest round of US sanctions targeting its oil industry. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790682_1_20250207151349.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran on Friday condemned as "illegal" and "unjustified" new financial sanctions by the United States that target a network accused of shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian crude oil to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The decision of the new US government to exert pressure on the Iranian nation by preventing Iran's legal trade with its economic partners is an illegitimate, illegal and violative measure," foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US move was "categorically unjustified and contrary to international rules", Baqaei added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of the Treasury on Thursday announced financial sanctions against an international network "facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars" to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The oil was shipped on behalf of Iran's Armed Forces General Staff and a sanctioned front company called Sepehr Energy Jahan Nama Pars, the treasury department wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions came after US President Donald Trump reinstated his "maximum pressure" policy against Iran over allegations the country is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran has slammed the reinstatement of the policy -- similar to one Trump levied against Tehran during his first term as president -- saying pursuing it would end in "failure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the tough policy of sanctions during Trump's first term, which ended in 2021, Washington withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal that had imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the deal -- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- until a year after Washington pulled out, but then began rolling back its commitments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to revive the 2015 deal have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Wednesday called for a "verified nuclear peace agreement" with Iran, adding that it "cannot have a Nuclear Weapon".
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran insists its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes and denies any intention to develop atomic weapons. (AFP)

    Fentanyl fatality rate 'higher in Canada than US'

<img alt="Edmonton, in Canada, holds an Overdose Awareness Day. File photo (AFP)" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790650_1_20250207093916.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fentanyl is killing more people per capita in Canada than in the United States, Ottawa's public safety minister said on Thursday, calling the two nations "connected" in combating the opioid crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has accused Canada of not doing enough to counter the flow of fentanyl across their shared border, and cited the issue as justification for his threatened import tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has committed to addressing those concerns, while maintaining that less than one percent of fentanyl in the United States comes from Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On per capita population, we're losing more Canadians than Americans are losing Americans," Public Safety Minister David McGuinty told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are connected with this crisis."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US estimates, an average of 205 Americans have died each day of opioid overdoses in recent years, mostly from fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada has seen 21 deaths per day, according to the latest data, but its population is about 12 times smaller than that of its southern neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGuinty's remarks came after he met with senior federal police and border agency officials "to operationalise" a US$900 million border security plan launched in response to Trump's tariffs threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25 percent tariffs - which Trump has also said were necessary to force action to stem migrant crossings - were scheduled to take effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the president granted Canada a 30-day reprieve to allow for further talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the last-minute deal to put off the tariffs, the prime minister agreed to name a point person to lead the fight against fentanyl. (AFP)

    Judge pauses Musk plan for mass cull of govt workers

<img alt="A protester holds a sign referencing Elon Musk, who is heading President Trump's drive to shrink the federal government, outside New York's City Hall. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790638_1_20250207084628.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge on Thursday paused a scheme masterminded by billionaire Elon Musk to slash the size of the US government by encouraging federal workers to quit through a mass buyout.
 <br>
  <br>
  The federal judge in Massachusetts ordered a temporary injunction on the plan's deadline - midnight Thursday - given by Musk for the country's more than two million government employees. The offer was to quit with eight months' pay or risk being fired in future culls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadline is now extended to Monday, when US District Judge George O'Toole will hold a hearing on the merits of the case brought by labour unions, US media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, the world's richest person and President Donald Trump's biggest donor, is in charge of a free-ranging entity called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, more than 40,000 staff have so far accepted the buyout deal - a relatively small number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unions representing some 800,000 civil servants and Democratic members of Congress are resisting the scheme and have challenged the legality of threats to fire civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the broader budget cutting campaign has already severely disrupted departments and agencies that for decades have run everything from education to national intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID, the government's agency for distributing aid around the world, has been crippled, with foreign-based staff ordered home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also repeatedly said he wants to shut down the Department of Education. The inducements to resign have further been extended to the CIA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt told reporters that federal workers should "accept the very generous offer" of a deferred resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said "competent" replacements would be found for those who "want to rip the American people off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the controversies swirling around the Musk plan is how much access the South African-born tycoon is getting to secret government data, including the Treasury's entire payment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg TV on Thursday that there was "a lot of misinformation" and that access to such data was only given to two Treasury employees who are working with Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent said those employees had "read-only" access, meaning they couldn't change the data. (AFP)

 Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino on Thursday rejected the United States' claim that it negotiated free passage for government vessels through the Panama Canal as an "absolute falsehood."

  <br>
  The Panama Canal Authority, which runs the waterway linking the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean, has also rejected the claim by the US State Department that US government vessels would go through for free.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government, said it had not made any changes to charge fees or rights to cross the canal, adding its statement was directly in response to the US claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department had said earlier that Panama's government had agreed to no longer charge crossing fees for US government vessels, in a move that would save America millions of dollars a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With total responsibility, the Panama Canal Authority, as it has indicated, is willing to establish dialogue with relevant US officials regarding the transit of wartime vessels from said country," the canal authority responded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama has became a focal point of the Trump administration as the president has accused the Central American country of charging excessive rates to use its trade passage, one of the busiest in the world. (Reuters)

    January sets 'surprising' heat record: EU monitor

<img alt="The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January according to the European climate service Copernicus. File photo: AFP ." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790589_1_20250206214334.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last month was the hottest January on record, Europe's climate monitor said on Thursday, despite expectations that cooler La Nina conditions might quell a streak of record-breaking global temperatures.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Copernicus Climate Change Service said January was 1.75 degrees Celsius hotter than pre-industrial times, extending a persistent run of historic highs over 2023 and 2024, as human-caused greenhouse gas emissions heat the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate scientists had expected this exceptional spell to subside after a warming El Nino event peaked in January 2024 and conditions gradually shifted to a cooling La Nina phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the heat has lingered at record or near-record levels ever since, sparking debate among scientists about what other factors could be driving warming to the top end of expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is what makes it a bit of a surprise... you're not seeing this cooling effect, or temporary brake at least, on the global temperature that we were expecting to see," Julien Nicolas, a climate scientist from Copernicus, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  La Nina is expected to be weak and Copernicus said prevailing temperatures in parts of the equatorial Pacific Ocean suggested "a slowing or stalling of the move towards" the cooling phenomenon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas said it could disappear completely by March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists warn that every fraction of a degree of warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events like heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Copernicus said that global temperatures averaged across 2023 and 2024 had exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  This did not constitute a permanent breach of the long-term 1.5C warming target under the Paris climate accord -- but was a clear sign that the limit was being tested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Copernicus said Arctic sea ice in January hit a monthly record low, virtually tied with 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysis from the United States this week put it at the second-lowest in that dataset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, 2025 is not expected to follow 2023 and 2024 into the history books: scientists predict it will rank as the third hottest year yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Copernicus said it would be closely monitoring ocean temperatures throughout 2025 for hints about how the climate might behave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oceans are a vital climate regulator and carbon sink, and cooler waters can absorb greater amounts of heat from the atmosphere, helping to lower air temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also store 90 percent of the excess heat trapped by humanity's release of greenhouse gases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This heat is bound to resurface periodically," said Nicolas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that's also one of the questions -- is this what has been happening over the past couple of years?" (AFP)

    Britain's Grenfell Tower to be demolished

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Grenfell Tower, which was engulfed in flames more than seven years ago in a disaster that killed 72 people, will be demolished, bereaved families and survivors said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire ripped through the 23-storey social housing block in one of London's richest areas during the early hours of June 14, 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Britain's deadliest blaze in a residential building since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell Next of Kin (GNK), which represents the relatives of nearly half of those who died, said Britain's deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, announced her decision to a room of families and survivors in a meeting on Wednesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the group, the demolition of the tower, which remains standing but covered in protective wrap, will only start after the eighth anniversary of the tragedy in June this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Engineers advising the government said the structure of the tower would worsen over time, and the building or part of it that was significantly damaged should be carefully taken down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do we wish the whole tower could stand forever? Yes. Is that an option? Not from a structural point of view," GNK said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell United said the voices of bereaved families and survivors were not heard or considered by Rayner during what they described as a short four-week consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ignoring the voices of bereaved on the future of our loved ones' gravesite is disgraceful and unforgivable," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department of housing, communities and local government did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but the decision was confirmed by Joe Powell, the member of parliament for Kensington, the area where the tower is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said on X that the decision had not been taken lightly: "Grenfell Tower will always be in our hearts as a community."
  <br>
  <br>
  A public inquiry into the fire, which published its final report last year, blamed the disaster on failings by the government, construction industry and, most of all, the firms involved in fitting the exterior with flammable cladding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several survivors and families have said the inquiry has delayed any criminal proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A commission looking at a future memorial on the site of the disaster said in its 2023 report that if the tower came down it should be "dismantled with care and respect".
  <br>
  <br>
  A final design for the memorial is expected by spring 2026, and construction could begin that year. (Reuters)

    'Cross-border e-commerce unaffected by policy changes'

<img alt="The Commerce Ministry urged the US to create a fair and predictable policy environment for the development of cross-border e-commerce. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790546_1_20250206171534.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said cross-border e-commerce remained competitive despite the scrapping of America's de minimis exemption for the import of small goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  The removal of the exemption means that goods from Chinese retailers, especially e-commerce players, are now subject to the additional US duties on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how a country adjusts its trade policy, the advantages and characteristics of cross-border e-commerce have not disappeared, and are still very competitive," said Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we hope that the US can follow the development trend of international trade, enhance supervision, and create a fair and predictable policy environment for the development of cross-border e-commerce."
  <br>
  <br>
  The elimination of the duty-free exemption for low value packages and US President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports have caused confusion, with the US Postal Services reversing a decision not to accept parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  While tariffs on Chinese goods went ahead on Tuesday, Trump suspended his threats of imposing levies on Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the move, He said Beijing is ready to work with other countries to "jointly respond to the challenges of unilateralism and trade protectionism".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unilateral imposition of tariffs by the US seriously violates World Trade Organisation rules. It is egregious in nature, and a typical unilateral trade protectionism that damages the rules-based multilateral trading system, disrupts the stability of global supply chains, and exacerbates international trade tensions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China does not proactively initiate trade disputes but will take necessary measures in response to one-sided bullying, He added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday warned that war-ravaged Gaza is not a political bargaining chip, following a proposal to take over the region from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a regular press briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiankun said China firmly supports the "legitimate national rights" of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people. It is an inalienable part of the territory of Palestine, not a bargaining chip for political games," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China firmly supports the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, believes that Palestinians governing Palestine is an important principle that must be upheld in the post-conflict governance of Gaza, and opposes the forced displacement of the people of Gaza,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a growing number of countries blocking access to DeepSeek, Guo said Beijing has never asked firms to illegally store data.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government attaches great importance to data privacy and security, and protects it in accordance with the law. We have never asked and will never ask any companies or individuals to collect or store data against the laws," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has all along opposed the move to overstretch the concept of national security, or politicise trade and tech issues. We will firmly protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies at the same time."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea became the latest government to warn about or place restrictions on the Chinese artificial intelligence startup, saying the firm did not respond to a data watchdog request about how it manages user information.

 The United States said on Wednesday that its government vessels would be allowed to sail for free through the Panama Canal, following heavy pressure from President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  "US government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the US government millions of dollars a year," the State Department said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first public announcement of promises hinted at by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said that Panama offered concessions during his talks on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said he had told Panama that it was unfair for the United States to be in a position to defend the vital waterway and also to be charged for its use.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and Panama are scheduled to hold new talks on Friday to discuss the canal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's industry ministry has temporarily blocked employee access to Chinese artificial intelligence startup, DeepSeek, a ministry official said, after it did not respond to a data watchdog request about how it manages user information.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier issued a notice calling on ministries and agencies to exercise caution about using AI services including DeepSeek and ChatGPT at work, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  State-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power said it had blocked use of AI services including DeepSeek earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean defence ministry has also blocked access to DeepSeek on its computers that are for military use, officials said on Thursday, and the foreign ministry has restricted access to DeepSeek in computers that connect to external networks, Yonhap News Agency said. The ministry said it cannot confirm specific security measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear if the ministries had taken any actions against ChatGPT.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban makes South Korea the latest government to warn about or place restrictions on DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia banned DeepSeek this week from all government devices over concerns on how it uses data.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launch by the Chinese startup of its latest AI models last month sent shockwaves through the tech world. The company says its models are on a par with or better than products developed in the United States and are produced at a fraction of the cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has said it used less-advanced H800 chips - permitted for sale to China until 2023 under US export controls - to power its large learning model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have also said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration that could lead to faster breakthroughs. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping met Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra in Beijing on Thursday, Xinhua news agency reported, as the two countries eye closer ties amid growing global uncertainties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn is on an official visit to China from February 5 to 8, marking her first visit to the country since taking office in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-day visit coincides with the 50th anniversary of China-Thailand diplomatic relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai leader's visit also came on the same day that Thailand began cutting electricity, fuel and internet services to areas in Myanmar along Thailand-Myanmar borders to tackle online fraud, an issue believed to be high on the agenda during the prime minister's visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks between Xi and Paetongtarn also come as Beijing is navigating a new trade war with the United States, triggered by US President Donald Trump's 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports. (Reuters)

 US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in women's sports, in his latest move targeting transgender people since returning to office.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From now on women's sports will be only for women," Trump said before he signed the order at the White House, surrounded by dozens of children and female athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With this executive order the war on women's sports is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top Republicans including US House Speaker Mike Johnson and firebrand Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene were among those in the audience to watch the signing ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, and we will not allow men to beat up, injure and cheat our women and our girls," Trump added to applause and cheers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order allows US government agencies to deny funds to schools that allow transgender athletes to compete on women's teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated... and risk your federal funding," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would now push the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to change its rules on transgender athletes before the 2028 Los Angeles Games. (AFP)

    China launches dispute at WTO over Trump tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 China filed a World Trade Organisation complaint on Wednesday against US President Donald Trump's new 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports and his cancellation of a duty-free exemption for low-value packages, arguing the actions are "protectionist" and break WTO rules.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's request for US trade consultations came as confusion reigned among shippers and retailers over Trump's cancellation of the "de minimis" exemption for package imports valued under US$800.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tax exemption has benefitted e-commerce firms including Shein, Temu and Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Customs and Border Protection official said all small packages from mainland China and Hong Kong needed to have customs entries on file prior to arrival, and there was the potential for some cargo to be sent back without this paperwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Washington correspondent, Simon Marks, said this could lead to significant delays in package deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So recipients are going to be told in order for you to receive delivery of this package, before you get it, you have to pay the duty, and that will then release the package from Customs," he told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=1003719&livetime=20250206000000">
   <b>
    <u>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </u>
   </b>
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is absolutely going to delay substantially, at least to begin with, the delivery of these items here in the United States, because the customer service is going to have to look at every single one of them - and there are a vast number of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Marks warned that apart from the supply chain disruption, consumers will also feel the pinch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Businesses] either have to absorb the tariffs, or they have to raise the price of the good that they are bringing in from outside the country and providing to American consumers," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's why so many economists here have argued that President Donald Trump and members of his economic inner circle simply don't understand the costs of tariffs to the American consumers, that they are inherently inflationary."
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTO said China submitted a request for consultations with the US on the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The request for consultations is the start of a dispute process that could lead to a ruling that Trump's duties violated trade rules in the same manner that a 2020 WTO ruling found that his first-term China tariffs broke trade regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such a victory would be unlikely to bring Beijing relief because the WTO's Appellate Body has been largely inoperable for years, as the US has blocked the appointment of appellate judges over what it views as judicial overreach by the body.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body is unable to function with fewer than three judges. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Delta aircraft clipped by taxiing JAL plane on tarmac

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Japan Airlines plane that was taxiing on the tarmac of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport apparently clipped the tail of a parked Delta aircraft on Wednesday morning, airport authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities responded to the incident around 10:17am, the airport said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  All passengers from Japan Airlines flight 68 and Delta Air Lines flight 1921 were deplaned with no reported injuries, and response crews were working to move the aircraft off the ramp taxiway, the airport said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delta spokesperson Samantha Moore Facteau said in an email that its Boeing 737 was waiting to have ice removed from its exterior when the wing tip of another aircraft reportedly made contact with its tail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deicing, as it's known, can occur before a flight begins to taxi to the runway, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 142 passengers on board the flight to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and they were transferred to a new aircraft, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no reports of injuries for crew or passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason Chan, one of the passengers on the Delta flight, said the plane “jiggled back and forth” and shook a little bit when the collision occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after, the captain announced that the plane's tail had been hit. Passengers remained calm, Chan said, and eventually got off the plane to be taken back to the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport operations were minimally impacted because the incident occurred on a taxi lane, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate, spokesperson Sam Lichtman said in an emailed statement. (AP)

    Trump administration appears to walk back Gaza plan

<img alt="US Secretary of State Marco Rubio describes Donald Trump's plan for Gaza as " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790458_1_20250206071900.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House on Wednesday appeared to walk back elements of President Donald Trump's shock plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza and launch a US takeover of the devastated territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  A day after Trump said "the US will take over" and "own" Gaza and that Palestinians would "go to other countries," the administration sought to downplay expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Republican leader wanted Palestinians to be only "temporarily relocated" out of Gaza instead of permanently resettled in Arab-majority states like Egypt.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the rebuilding of Gaza would not be paid for by the United States and that US troops were not likely to be sent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been made very clear to the president that the United States needs to be involved in this rebuilding effort to ensure stability in the region for all people," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "that does not mean boots on the ground in Gaza, it does not mean American taxpayers will be funding this effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said Trump has been "very clear" that "he expects our partners in the region, particularly Egypt and Jordan, to accept Palestinian refugees, temporarily, so that we can rebuild their home."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a demolition site right now. It's not a liveable place for any human being," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the deployment of US troops into Gaza was being ruled out, Leavitt said: "The president has not committed to that just yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is ready to "look at all options" when asked if he was working on options to deploy troops to Gaza, but did not provide specifics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to working with our allies, our counterparts, both diplomatically and militarily, to look at all options," Hegseth told journalists as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Trump's idea "was not meant as hostile. It was meant as, I think, a very generous move – the offer to rebuild and to be in charge of the rebuilding."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump wants to support "rebuilding homes and businesses and things of this nature, so that then people can move back in," Rubio told reporters on a visit to Guatemala.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's surprise announcement on Tuesday sparked intense pushback from the Palestinian leadership and governments in the region and in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes in the context of mediated negotiations between Israel and the militant group Hamas to reach the "second phase" of a ceasefire deal that would bring a more permanent end to the devastating war in Gaza. (AFP)

    Monkeys attack tourists at Angkor Wat

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wild monkeys egged on by YouTubers have been rampaging at Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat complex, attacking tourists, wrecking temple stonework and damaging information boards, officials said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency that runs the Unesco-listed site warned visitors to steer clear of the growing gangs of "aggressive" macaques that live around the sprawling complex of ruins and have been biting tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The macaques are native to the lush forests that surround Angkor Wat, but the Apsara National Authority said human interaction – particularly by people filming content to post online – had changed their behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small number of YouTubers regularly fed monkeys to create videos and this has "changed the monkeys' natural behaviour from being wild animals to domestic ones that are aggressive, steal food, and cause injuries among people," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some have reportedly even filmed themselves abusing macaques.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long Kosal, a spokesman for the Apsara National Authority, said that as well as the danger posed to tourists, the agency was increasingly worried about the monkeys damaging the centuries-old stonework.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On top of biting visitors, they have been climbing up and pushing stones down, damaging temples," he said, adding that the macaques had also damaged information boards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency has urged tourists to leave the monkeys alone while visiting the ruins, and said it is looking for "an appropriate solution" to the problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Angkor Wat, built from the 9th to the 15th centuries, was the capital of the Khmer Empire and is Cambodia's top tourist attraction, bringing in valuable revenue to a poor country. (AFP)

    China vows 'necessary measures' over parcel halt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has urged the United States to stop "politicising trade and economic issues" and vowed to take unspecified "necessary measures" after the United States Postal Service (USPS) announced it had temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The USPS said the suspension will remain in place until further notice, with the move coming after US President Donald Trump slapped extra tariffs on Chinese imports and ended a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government calls on the United States to stop politicising and weaponising trade and economic issues, stop going after or suppressing Chinese companies," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian at a regular media briefing on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said Beijing "deplores and firmly opposes" the move by Washington regarding Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, China announced countermeasures of tariffs on a number of US goods, which will take effect next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What [action] China takes is necessary to protect its legitimate rights and interests. Trade wars and tariff wars have no winners. Threatening China with pressure leads nowhere," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the United States to correct its wrongdoings, solve each side's concerns through equal-footed consultation, and promote the sound, stable and sustainable development of China-US relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing also called for dialogue between China and the US after Trump said he was in no hurry to speak to President Xi Jinping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said what is needed is not unilateral, additional tariffs but exchanges based on equality and mutual respect.

    People frustrated with postal suspension from HK to US

<div class="itemFullText">
 People in Hong Kong who wish to send mail to the United States expressed their frustration at the situation on Wednesday, after the US stopped receiving parcels from mainland China and the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States Postal Service announced on Tuesday that it was temporarily suspending inbound parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong until further notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkong Post's website showed postal services regarding packets and parcels to the US were temporarily not available. But people could still mail letters to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman at the General Post Office in Central said she was baffled by the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sending a gift to my son in college. They said I can't send a package, I can only send a letter. I'm not happy. I'm going to try SF Express and DHL," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman said she wanted to send a card and a congratulatory gift after her friend in the US had a baby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They weren't sure why, what happened. They just said it's suspended for now. I'm going to find somewhere else and see if I can send it another way," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK reached out to various international shipping companies, and DHL's customer service office said it was still accepting packages to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the company said guidelines are updated every half an hour and things may change.
  <br>
  <br>
  FedEx and UPS, meanwhile, said postal services were not affected, but it may take a longer time for parcels to arrive in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrangement came after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods, and scrapped a duty-free exemption policy for low-value packages.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippine lawmakers on Wednesday voted to send articles of impeachment against Vice President Sara Duterte to the Senate, a day before the current congressional session is set to end.
 <br>
  <br>
  While specifics of the impeachment were not divulged, the vote follows the filing of a trio of complaints last month accusing Duterte of crimes ranging from the "brazen misuse" of millions of dollars in public funds to plotting President Ferdinand Marcos's assassination.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having been filed by more than one-third of the membership of the House of Representatives, or a total of 215 members ... the motion is approved," House Speaker Martin Romualdez told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's fate now lies in the hands of the Philippines' 24 senators, two-thirds of whom must vote for her impeachment to make it a reality.
  <br>
  <br>
  A trial date has yet to be set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's filing comes days before campaigning officially begins for mid-term elections, widely expected to set the table for the 2028 presidential race.

  <br>
  The relationship between Duterte and President Marcos is at a nadir, their former alliance giving way to a months-long public battle that has seen the trading of wild accusations, including an alleged death threat that remains under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Marcos had previously urged Congress not to pursue Duterte's impeachment, calling it a "storm in a teacup" that would distract the legislature from its primary responsibilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos's executive secretary Lucas Bersamin, however, said on Monday that the Office of the President would "not interfere" with the impeachment complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was widely tipped to succeed her father Rodrigo as president in 2022 elections but stepped aside to back Marcos and later ran for vice president on his ticket.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the alliance has since imploded. In November, she delivered an expletive-laden speech saying she had ordered someone to kill Marcos if she herself was assassinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  She later denied that her comments constituted a death threat, saying she had only been expressing "consternation" with the administration's failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alleged assassination threat was among the allegations included in the last of the three complaints filed against Duterte, lodged December 19 by seven Manila-based Catholic priests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Impeachment is the necessary, ultimate line of defence against corruption at the highest rungs of officialdom," it said. "She cannot be vice president a minute longer." (AFP)

    Saudi Arabia downplays potential ties with Israel

<img alt='A billboard depicting US President Donald Trump with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with the slogan: "Israel is ready " (for normalising relations with Saudi Arabia) is displayed in Jerusalem.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia said Wednesday it would not formalise ties with Israel unless a Palestinian state is established, after Israel's prime minister remarked that he thought normalisation with the Gulf kingdom was "going to happen".
 <br>
  <br>
  "Saudi Arabia will continue its relentless efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that," the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both US President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden have backed Israel and Saudi Arabia having diplomatic relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Riyadh paused tentative talks on the matter early in the Gaza conflict and hardened its rhetoric as the war continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign ministry's statement came swiftly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said establishing formal relations "is not only feasible, I think it's going to happen".
  <br>
  <br>
  His government remains opposed to the internationally backed two-state solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu was speaking at the White House alongside Trump, whose administration in 2020 brokered accords which saw Israel establish relations with the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Bahrain.
  <br>
  <br>
  That raised hopes of a similar deal with Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's richest economy and guardian of Islam's two holiest sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia does not recognise Israel, but since 2020 has been negotiating rapprochement in exchange for a US defence pact and Washington's help on a civilian nuclear programme. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands begin voting in the Indian capital’s state legislature election on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party trying to unseat a powerful regional group that has ruled New Delhi for over a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Voters walked to polling booths on a cold, wintry morning to cast their ballots across the sprawling capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manish Sisodia, a key Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader, and others offered prayers in a temple before voting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is up against the AAP, led by Arvind Kejriwal, which runs New Delhi and has built a vast support base on its welfare policies and an anti-corruption movement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kejriwal, a popular crusader against corruption, suffered a setback as he himself faced graft allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AAP won 62 out of 70 seats in a landslide victory in the last election, held in 2020, leaving BJP with only eight and the Congress party with none.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AAP had also swept the 2015 state elections, winning 67 seats, with the BJP taking three.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi and Kejriwal have both campaigned vigorously in roadshows with thousands of supporters tailing them.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have offered to revamp government schools and provide free health services and electricity, and a monthly stipend of over 2,000 rupees (US$25) to poor women.
  <br>
  <br>
  Results are due on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 15 million people are eligible to vote in New Delhi's election. (AP)

<img alt="The Trump administration is carrying out plans to fold the USAID humanitarian agency and merge it into the US State Department. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790336_1_20250205112314.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trump administration is placing US Agency for International Development (USAID) direct-hire staffers around the world on leave except those deemed essential, upending the aid agency’s six-decade mission overseas.
 <br>
  <br>
  A notice posted online Tuesday gives the workers 30 days to return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move had been rumoured for several days and was the most extreme of several proposals considered for consolidating the agency into the State Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other options had included closures of smaller USAID missions and partial closures of larger ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programmes worldwide shut down after US President Donald Trump imposed a sweeping freeze on foreign assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the space of a few weeks, Trump's political appointees, including tech tycoon Elon Musk’s budget-slashing team, have dismantled the aid agency despite outcry from Democratic lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have ordered a spending stop that has paralysed US-funded aid and development work around the world, gutted the senior leadership and workforce with furloughs and firings, and closed Washington headquarters to staffers Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers said the agency’s computer servers were carted away.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” Musk boasted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk’s teams had taken USAID’s website offline over the weekend and it came back online Tuesday night, with the notice of recall or termination for global staffers its sole post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to withdraw direct-hire staff and their families earlier than their planned departures will likely cost the government tens of millions of dollars in travel and relocation costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff being placed on leave include both foreign and civil service officers who have legal protection against arbitrary dismissal and being placed on leave without reason. (AP)

    Australia bans DeepSeek on govt devices

<img alt="Australia's decision to ban DeepSeek follows similar action in Italy, while other countries in Europe and elsewhere are also looking into the AI firm. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790323_1_20250205102715.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices, a top official said Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The DeepSeek chatbot - developed by a China-based startup - has astounded industry insiders and upended financial markets since it was released last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a growing list of countries including South Korea, Italy and France have voiced questions over how the application handles personal data and what information is used to train DeepSeek's AI system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia upped the ante overnight banning DeepSeek from all government devices, one of the toughest moves against the Chinese chatbot yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an action the government has taken on the advice of security agencies. It's absolutely not a symbolic move," said government cyber security envoy Andrew Charlton.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with national broadcaster ABC, Charlton voiced concern that uploaded information "might not be kept private".
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Home Affairs Department issued a directive to government employees overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After considering threat and risk analysis, I have determined that the use of DeepSeek products, applications and web services poses an unacceptable level of security risk to the Australian Government," Department of Home Affairs Secretary Stephanie Foster said in the directive.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of Wednesday all non-corporate Commonwealth entities must "identify and remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services on all Australian Government systems and mobile devices," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The directive also required that "access, use or installation of DeepSeek products" be prevented across government systems and mobile devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration and experimentation that could lead to faster breakthroughs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the firm has unveiled large language models challenging the dominate tools developing by its US rivals, but at a lower cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2018, Australia banned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from its national 5G network, citing national security concerns, and TikTok was banned from government devices in 2023 on the advice of Australian intelligence agencies. (AFP & agencies)

    Trump says US should take over Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump predicted on Tuesday that the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, home to more than two million Palestinians, could become "the Riviera of the Middle East" as he announced his plan to take control of it.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Riviera of the Middle East. This could be something that could be so magnificent," Trump said at a joint press conference with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at which he again voiced hopes that Palestinians could be removed from Gaza, and said the United States would redevelop the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love Israel. I will visit there and I'll visit Gaza and I'll visit Saudi Arabia and I'll visit other places all over the Middle East," Trump told reporters at the White House, without committing to any timetable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as talks are ramping up this week with the promise of surging humanitarian aid and reconstruction supplies to help the people of Gaza recover after more than 15 months of devastating conflict. Now Trump wants to push roughly 1.8 million people to leave the land they have called home and claim it for the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump outlined his thinking as he held talks with Netanyahu at the White House, where the two leaders also discussed the fragile ceasefire and hostage deal in the Israeli-Hamas conflict and shared concerns about Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think people should be going back," Trump said. “You can’t live in Gaza right now. I think we need another location. I think it should be a location that’s going to make people happy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the US would take ownership of the Gaza Strip and redevelop it after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere and turn the territory into “the Riviera of the Middle East" in which the “world's people” - including Palestinians - would live.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ll make sure that it’s done world class," Trump said. "It’ll be wonderful for the people - Palestinians, Palestinians mostly, we’re talking about.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt, Jordan and other US allies in the Mideast have cautioned Trump that relocating Palestinians from Gaza would threaten Mideast stability, risk expanding the conflict and undermine a decades-long push by the US and allies for a two-state solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Trump insists the Palestinians “have no alternative” but to leave the "big pile of rubble” that is Gaza. He spoke out as his top aides stressed that a three-to-five-year timeline for reconstruction of the war-torn territory, as laid out in a temporary truce agreement, is not viable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, both Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II dismissed Trump's calls to resettle Gazans.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said he believes Egypt and Jordan - as well as other countries, which he did not name - will ultimately agree to take in Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You look over the decades, it’s all death in Gaza,” Trump said. "This has been happening for years. It’s all death. If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what’s happening in Gaza.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he isn’t ruling out deploying US troops to support reconstruction of Gaza. He envisions “long-term” US ownership of a redevelopment of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Netanyahu is facing competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and for the 15-month conflict to end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. (Agencies)

    Nepal hikes Everest climb permit costs

<img alt="Fees for the peak spring climbing season will rise from US$11,000 to US$15,000 for a permit to scale the 8,849-metre peak. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790257_1_20250204210217.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nepal has hiked the cost of an Everest climbing permit by a third, arguing it will help tackle pollution and boost safety on the world's highest mountain, the tourism chief said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fees for the peak spring climbing season will rise from US$11,000 to US$15,000 for a permit to scale the 8,849-metre peak, Narayan Prasad Regmi, director general of the tourism department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cost had remained constant for a decade and it was high time to revise that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Costs of climbing at less popular – and more demanding – times of year such as during winter or the monsoon rains have also risen at similar rates, including from US$5,500 to US$7,500 during the autumn season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 peaks over 8,000 metres and welcomes thousands of climbers each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign climbers already spend tens of thousands of dollars in their attempt to climb Everest, with more than 400 purchasing permits last year, bringing in around US$4 million to government coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The funds are put towards cleaning trash from the mountain left by climbers as well as search and rescue operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mountaineering expedition companies hoped the price hike would not deter climbers, warning some might look to scale Everest through China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some climbers might shift to Tibet where the facilities are much better," said Mingma G Sherpa, who runs the Imagine Nepal mountaineering company, saying the fee must be spent on improving conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our government just increases the royalty, but doesn't do much," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It needs to also provide support to the climbers and guides."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nepal has been criticised for allowing too many climbers on Everest while doing little to keep the peak clean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the Nepal government ordered Everest mountaineers to carry mandatory trackers and carry bags to remove their excrement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fee increase was approved by the government in January, but was only published in the national gazette late on Monday. (AFP)

 Around 10 people have been killed in a shooting at an adult education centre, Swedish police said, the deadliest attack to take place in Sweden on what the prime minister said was a "painful day" for the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gunman is believed to be among those killed and a search is continuing at the school for other possible victims, the local police chief told a press conference. The perpetrator's motive was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know that 10 or so people have been killed here today. The reason that we can't be more exact currently is that the extent of the incident is so large," local police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest said police believed the gunman had acted alone and that they did not currently suspect terrorism as a motive, though he cautioned that much remained unknown. He said the suspected gunman had not previously been known to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a big crime scene, we have to complete the searches we are conducting in the school. There are a number of investigative steps we are taking: a profile of the perpetrator, witness interviews ... Obviously, it's a significant amount of work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they had opened an investigation into murder, arson and an aggravated weapons offence and that the search for possible further victims had continued into the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooting took place in Orebro, some 200 kilometres west of Stockholm, at the Risbergska school for adults who did not complete their formal education or failed to get the grades to continue to higher education. It is located on a campus that also houses schools for children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a very painful day for the whole of Sweden," Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My thoughts are (also) with all of those whose normal school day was turned into fear. Being locked up in a classroom fearing for your life is a nightmare no one should have to experience." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Global space agencies are closely monitoring a building-size space rock that has a tiny chance of hitting Earth seven years from now.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA) estimate that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, is around 40 to 100 metres wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ESA said it has an almost 99 percent chance of safely passing Earth on December 22, 2032, but a possible impact could not be entirely ruled out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Astronomy expert, Professor Quentin Parker from the University of Hong Kong, said if the asteroid hits Earth, it would cause a devastating impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like a 10 megaton nuclear explosion on that city. But the likelihood is, given that two-thirds of the Earth's surface is water, it'll go into the ocean... creating a small tsunami, which actually could be quite dangerous to landfall around where that occurred," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it hits in a desert, or in an unpopulated region, it'll devastate the surrounding region up to maybe several tens of kilometres in terms of graded damage from the epicentre to the edge where the damage is completely catastrophic at the impact site, then drops off as you get further away."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said there are still many unknowns and scientists could make more accurate estimations when the asteroid comes closer to Earth again in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard to study because it has a very elliptical orbit. It goes very far away and comes close. You can only study when it comes close. When it comes close again in 2028, we'll be able to refine the orbit again even further," Parker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's nothing we can do in terms of sending out a rocket at the moment to deflect it."
  <br>
  <br>
  The asteroid now stands at the top of the ESA's asteroid risk list and Nasa's automated Sentry risk list, which include any known asteroids with a non-zero probability of colliding with Earth.

    El Salvador offers to jail Americans: Marco Rubio

<img alt="US Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele as the pair discussed the transfer of prisoners from America to El Salvador. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790192_1_20250204114042.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 El Salvador's leader has made the offer to jail Americans sent by their own country, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  There is virtually no precedent in contemporary times for a democratic country to send its own citizens to foreign jails, and any attempt to do so is sure to be challenged in US courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Rubio welcomed an offer to do just that by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, whose sweeping crackdown on crime has won him soaring popularity at home and hero status for many in US President Donald Trump's orbit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has offered to house in his jails dangerous American criminals in custody in our country, including those with US citizenship and legal residency," Rubio told reporters in San Salvador.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country's ever made an offer of friendship such as this," Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are profoundly grateful. I spoke to President Trump about this earlier today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said that Bukele was also willing to take back Salvadoran citizens as well as nationals of other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio appeared to suggest that the prison transfer would focus on members of Latin American gangs, such as El Salvador's MS-13 and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, who have acquired US citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal -- MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be -- he has offered his jails," Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since his return to the White House last month, Trump has put a top priority on speeding up the deportation of millions of people in the United States without legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has sought to crack down on the right to birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the US Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also unveiled plans to detain 30,000 migrants at the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- a prison which previous Democratic presidents hoped to close. (AFP)

    'China's approach to tariffs contrasts with the US'

<img alt="Analysts believe any potential Chinese countermeasures against US tariffs would be related to the military and tech sectors. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790179_1_20250204102142.jpg&q=20">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A political commentator said China’s move to file a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over the Trump administration's tariff threats aims to create a contrast to the US's practice of dealing with things.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump had announced a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports on top of existing duties, a measure which was supposed to take effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump held out the prospect of a deal with an announcement on Monday that talks between Beijing and Washington on tariffs would happen within "the next 24 hours".
  <br>
  <br>
  Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme that Beijing is "colouring within the lines of the international order" by turning to the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, the US has not allowed any appellate judges to be appointed since the Obama administration. That means that they can't render a final decision," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I think China is trying to create a stark contrast between what it's willing to do and Donald Trump who seems to... he likes colouring outside the lines. He likes to be brash, bold. He likes to threaten people. And though he generally will pivot on a dime if things aren’t going well, it's still a very marked contrast between two different responses."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Beijing has yet to impose any countermeasures, Tangen believes they could be related to military and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, China has a very large position in the rare earths area, it's indicated before, and has imposed some restrictions on that. You have to register to get some of the... rare earths and things like that. And they said they're not going to export them for military use. And I see that probably is where they're going to concentrate," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Regina Ip said Hong Kong has to be more flexible in dealing with incoming challenges, saying the fact that Mexico and Canada were able to delay the imposition of tariffs on their goods underlines the importance of engaging with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the one hand, you need to engage. On the other hand, you need to strengthen yourself and have an arsenal of tools to respond if necessary," Ip told RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has much less leverage being only an SAR. But we have full backing from our country. I think we need to be more nuanced and be more flexible in our approach when we deal with these sort of great power threats."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip, who chairs the New People's Party, said people doing business in the Hong Kong are more concerned about interest rates than tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want interest rates to come down to lessen the debt burden on many of our investors, including property tycoons. The continued trend of lowering interest rates would spur our economic growth. We hope the [US Federal Reserve] would resume the downward trend of interest rates if a trade war could be avoided," she said.

    Trump says he's pausing tariffs on Canada after talks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump delayed the start of tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month on Monday after America's neighbours struck last-minute deals to tighten border measures against the flow of migrants and the drug fentanyl.
 <br>
  <br>
  Global stock markets had slumped as Trump's threat of sweeping 25 percent levies on exports from Canada and Mexico to the United States sparked fears of a global trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after calls with Trump just hours before the US tariffs were due to take effect, both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum struck deals for a postponement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said that after "very friendly" talks with Sheinbaum he'd "immediately pause" the tariffs on Mexico, and that his counterpart had agreed to send 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico frontier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions appeared higher between the US and Canada, but after two separate calls Trump later said he was "very pleased" and was announcing a 30-day halt in the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Canada has agreed to ensure we have a secure Northern Border, and to finally end the deadly scourge of drugs like Fentanyl that have been pouring into our Country," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks on final deals would continue with both countries, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said after the "good call" that Canada deploy nearly 10,000 frontline officers to help secure the border, list drug cartels as terrorists, appoint a "Fentanyl Czar" and crack down on money laundering.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear the real extent of the changes on the Canadian border, given that just this December authorities there said they already had 8,500 personnel deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  China remains in the firing line for Trump tariffs. It faces a further 10 percent duty on top of existing levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president said last-minute talks between Washington and Beijing will likely be held "probably in the next 24 hours" to avoid new tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, China and Mexico are the United States's three biggest trading partners, and Trump's threatened tariffs have sent shock waves through the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's three main indices fell sharply in early deals, but clawed back ground after Trump's announcement on the Mexico deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a trade war, this is a drug war," National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC, complaining that "the Canadians appeared to have misunderstood the plain language."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, US government figures show that only a minimal quantity of drugs comes via Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada had vowed to respond strongly to the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its most populous province Ontario on Monday had banned US firms from bidding on tens of billions of dollars in government contracts -- and dumped a deal with Trump ally Elon Musk's Starlink.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has upped the pressure recently by calling Canada's existence into question -- once again calling on Monday for it to become the 51st US state.
  <br>
  <br>
  A political crisis in the Canadian government over Trump's tariff threats led to Trudeau announcing earlier this month that he would quit too. Canadians now face elections as early as April.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president -- who has said that tariff is the "most beautiful word in the dictionary" -- is going even further in his second term on the levies than he did in his first.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has insisted that the impact would be borne by foreign exporters without being passed on to American consumers, despite most experts saying the contrary.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the billionaire 78-year-old did acknowledge as he returned from a weekend at his Florida resort Sunday that Americans might feel economic "pain".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also wielded tariffs as a threat to achieve his wider policy goals, most recently when he said he would slap them on Colombia when it turned back US military planes carrying deported migrants. (AFP)

    Musk says Trump 'shutting down' US aid agency

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk, the world's richest person and US President Donald Trump's controversial close advisor, said on Monday the giant USAID humanitarian agency will be "shutting down" as part of his drive to shrink the US government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hours later, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated it was not disappearing but would come under his control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the acting director of USAID," Rubio told reporters on a visit to El Salvador, accusing the agency of "insubordination."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid confusion over the future of the US Agency for International Development, employees were instructed by email not to go to their offices Monday. Some 600 staffers found themselves locked out of their computer systems, ABC News reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID is the aid arm of US foreign policy, funding health and emergency programs in around 120 countries, including the world's poorest regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also seen as a source of soft power for US foreign policy, which Musk accused of being "corrupt" and involved in an array of political activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SpaceX and Tesla CEO, who has massive contracts with the US government and was the biggest financial backer of Trump's campaign, said he had personally cleared the unprecedented move with the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I went over with him in detail, and he agreed that we should shut it down," Musk said in a discussion on his X online platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Musk's aides have taken control of the US Treasury Department's payments system - which manages trillions of dollars of transactions each year -- sparking alarm among critics. (AFP)

    Trump confirms one-month 'pause' in Mexico tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump paused tariffs on Mexico for one month after last-minute talks on Monday, but there was no breakthrough yet in negotiations with Canada on an issue that has sparked fears of a global trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  As world markets slumped, Trump and his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum both announced the halt in the levies after she agreed to send 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border following talks on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on his Truth Social network that after the "very friendly conversation" he had "agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period."
  <br>
  <br>
  During that time there would be further talks "as we attempt to achieve a 'deal' between our two Countries," the Republican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leftist Sheinbaum had announced the tariff pause a few minutes earlier, saying she had a "good conversation with President Trump with great respect for our relationship and sovereignty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump agreed to increase measures to prevent trafficking of US weapons into Mexico, she said, a point that did not appear in Trump's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development came hours before the 25 percent levies that Trump has ordered on imports from the US neighbors and chief trading partners, plus an extra 10 percent on China, were due to take effect at midnight on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had also spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday and was due to speak again, but the White House said negotiations with Ottawa were not going as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump repeated his frequent claims that the United States is being unfairly treated by trade while pushing his argument that the tariffs were about a "drug war" from opioids "pouring through the Borders of Mexico and Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  US government figures show that only a minimal quantity of drugs comes via Canada. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Schools were closed and emergency crews deployed on the volcanic Greek island of Santorini on Monday after a spike in seismic activity raised concerns about a potentially powerful earthquake.
 <br>
  <br>
  Precautions were also ordered on several nearby Aegean Sea islands – all popular summer vacation destinations – after more than 200 undersea earthquakes were recorded in the area over the past three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a very intense geological phenomenon to handle,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said from Brussels, where he was attending a European meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to ask our islanders first and foremost to remain calm, to listen to the instructions of the Civil Protection (authority)."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mobile phones on the island blared with alert warnings about the potential for rock slides, while several earthquakes caused loud rumbles. Authorities banned access to some seaside areas, including the island's old port, that are in close proximity to cliffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These measures are precautionary, and authorities will remain vigilant,” Civil Protection Minister Vasilis Kikilias said late on Sunday following an emergency government meeting in Athens. “We urge citizens to strictly adhere to safety recommendations to minimise risk.”
  <br>
  <br>
  While Greek experts say the quakes, many with magnitudes over 4.5, are not linked to Santorini’s volcano, they acknowledge that the pattern of seismic activity is cause for concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government officials met with scientists throughout the weekend and on Monday to assess the situation, while schools were also ordered shut on the nearby islands of Amorgos, Anafi and Ios.
  <br>
  <br>
  The frequency of the quakes, which continued throughout Sunday night and into Monday, has worried residents and visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have never felt anything like this and with such frequency – an earthquake every 10 or 20 minutes. Everyone is anxious even if some of us hide it not to cause panic, but everyone is worried," said Michalis Gerontakis, who is also the director of the Santorini Philharmonic Orchestra.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We came out yesterday and performed. Despite the earthquakes, the philharmonic performed for a religious occasion,” Gerontakis said. "When you are playing, you cannot feel the quakes but there were earthquakes when we were at the church. No one can knows what will happen. People can say whatever they like, but that has no value. You cannot contend with nature.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents and visitors were advised to avoid large indoor gatherings and areas where rock slides could occur, while hotels were instructed to drain swimming pools to reduce potential building damage from an earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire service rescuers who arrived on the island on Sunday set up yellow tents as a staging area inside a basketball court next to the island's main hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We arrived last night, a 26-member team of rescuers and one rescue dog," said fire brigadier Ioannis Billias, adding that many residents, including entire families, spent the night in their cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some residents and local workers headed to travel agents seeking plane or ferry tickets to leave the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve had earthquakes before but never anything like this. This feels different," said Nadia Benomar, a Moroccan tour guide who has lived on the island for 19 years. She bought a ferry ticket Monday for the nearby island of Naxos.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I need to get away for a few days until things calm down,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others said they were willing to take the risk. Restaurant worker Yiannis Fragiadakis had been away but said he returned to Santorini on Sunday despite the earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I wasn’t afraid. I know that people are really worried and are leaving, and when I got to the port it was really busy, it was like the summer," Fragiadakis said. "I plan to stay and hopefully the restaurant will start working (for the holiday season) in three weeks.” (AP)

    Trial of Spain's ex-soccer boss for forced kiss begins

<div class="itemFullText">
 The highly anticipated trial of Spain's disgraced former football chief Luis Rubiales over the forced kiss he gave star forward Jenni Hermoso began on Monday with the player scheduled to take the stand.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old provoked worldwide outrage after he cupped Hermoso's head and gave her an unsolicited kiss after Spain beat England to win the 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are seeking two and a half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales and Hermoso did not greet each other as they arrived at the National Court in San Fernando de Henares near Madrid for the trial scheduled to run until February 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The kiss was given "unexpectedly and without the consent or acceptance of the player", prosecutors wrote in their indictment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Constant and repeated pressure was exerted directly on the player Jennifer Hermoso and through her family and friends with the aim of justifying and publicly approving the kiss that Luis Rubiales gave her against her will," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales is scheduled to take the stand on February 12. He has called the kiss an innocuous "peck between friends celebrating" and denied any coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the accused alongside Rubiales are ex-women's national team coach Jorge Vilda and two former federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stand accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them. (AFP)

    Markets grapple with fallout from Trump's trade war

<img alt="Investors around the world and in Asia are coming to terms with the sobering implications of the Trump administration's tariff salvo against Canada, Mexico and China. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790078_1_20250203135559.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investors bought dollars, sold stocks and fretted about inflation on Monday in a scramble to assess the risk of a trade war after Donald Trump put tariffs on top US trading partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's orders for additional levies of 25 percent on imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, as well as 10 percent on goods from China are light on detail.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they kick in on Tuesday and have jolted markets that had assumed Trump was mostly bluff and bluster.
  <br>
  <br>
  The selloff extended beyond just Canadian and Mexican markets and stocks directly in the line of fire, to cryptocurrencies, stocks and even the safe-haven Japanese yen, as investors tried to second-guess the volatile president's next moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Worries about the hit to growth from the inflationary impact of the wide-ranging tariffs and the uncertainty that creates for the Federal Reserve played a part, causing everything but the dollar and long-term US Treasuries to be sold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump's trade war has started," said Alvin Tan, head of Asia currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore, noting it was hard to see the US dollar retreating any time soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dollar has been the main mover, gaining as Trump headed for and then won office because investors figured tariff-hit countries would weaken their currencies to offset the impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the euro fell 1.3 percent on fears Europe may be next on the tariff list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's dollar skidded to a 20-year low on the greenback, China's yuan slid in offshore trade, oil jumped, metals slumped and US equity futures dropped about two percent on risks to US companies' bottom lines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the tariffs may cause "short term" pain for Americans, and while he would speak on Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, which have announced retaliatory tariffs of their own, he downplayed expectations that they would change his mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said equity bulls are re-evaluating their Trump trades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equity bulls seduced by 'Trump is good for equities' narrative are subject to a rude wake-up call from the potentially jarring impact on growth/earnings amid retaliatory tariff spirals," Mizuho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul and Taipei made losses around two percent in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  European stock futures slid 2.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has linked the tariffs to the flow of migrants and drugs - particularly fentanyl - into the US and demanded crackdowns in Canada, China and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Mexico have said fentanyl is America's problem, so prospects of a breakthrough are unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said it would challenge Trump's tariffs at the World Trade Organisation and take unspecified countermeasures. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beyoncé won Album of the Year for “Cowboy Carter” at the 2025 Grammys, delivering her — at last — the show’s elusive top award.
 <br>
  <br>
  The superstar, who is both the most awarded and nominated artist in Grammys history, has been nominated in the category four times before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the Los Angeles Fire Department presented Beyoncé with the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s been many, many years,” Beyoncé said in her speech. “I want to dedicate this to Ms Martell,” she said, referencing Linda Martell, the performer who became the first Black woman to play the Grand Ole Opry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The singer also emerged with the award for best country album for “Cowboy Carter."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kendrick Lamar's culture-shifting diss track "Not Like Us" on Sunday took home the Grammy for Record of the Year, beating popular tracks from a crew of pop heavyweights to claim the prestigious prize.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chappell Roan won the 2025 best new artist Grammy award on Sunday, beating out fellow nominees including popular "Espresso" singer Sabrina Carpenter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among her hits, "Hot to Go!", helped cement her status as one of 2024 up and coming artists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I told myself that if I ever got to stand up here in front of the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels and the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists offer a liveable wage," Roan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She expressed her own experience as a minor that was signed by a record label and eventually dropped from that contract, leaving her unable to afford health insurance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We (music artists) got you, but do you got us?" she added
  <br>
  <br>
  Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, known professionally as Chappell Roan, was nominated in six Grammy categories this year, including song of the year for "Good Luck, Babe!" (Reuters)

    Rubio meets Panama leader on Trump demands for canal

<img alt="Demonstrators hold a sign that reads in Spanish 'Trump XXDTM, the canal is ours' as they protest against the visit of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Panama City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790012_1_20250203005810.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio entered talks on Sunday with Panama's leader to press President Donald Trump's demand that the United States take back control of the Panama Canal.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has refused to back down on threats to seize the vital waterway and it remains unclear what Rubio can achieve diplomatically that would please him, with Panama firmly rejecting any claims against its sovereignty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio, in his first meeting abroad as the top US diplomat, walked past an honor guard outside the whitewashed walls of President Jose Raul Mulino's official residence in the tropical capital's old quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio shook hands with Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha and flashed a thumbs-up sign before heading into talks with Mulino. They made no immediate comments to the press.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio later in the day will tour the Panama Canal, the crucial link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through which some 40 percent of US container traffic passes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Rubio claim that China has gained too much power around the canal and could shut it down in a potential conflict, with catastrophic consequences for the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said that Panama has "totally violated" the understanding when the United States handed back the canal in late 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've already offered to do many things," Trump said Friday of Panama, "but we think it's appropriate that we take it back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scattered protests broke out in Panama ahead of Rubio's visit, with an effigy of him in a red, white and blue suit set on fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diojenes Sanchez, a professor who took part in the protests, vowed to defend Panama's sovereignty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We firmly reject the claims of the United States to turn Panama into a protectorate and colony," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal, which Trump has dubbed as a modern "wonder of the world", was built by the United States at the cost of thousands of lives of laborers, mostly people of African descent from Barbados, Jamaica and elsewhere in the Caribbean.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States maintained control of the canal when it opened in 1914 but began to negotiate following deadly riots in 1964 by Panamanians angered over foreign control. (AFP)

    'Canada will hit US with retaliatory tariffs Tuesday'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada will hit back at US tariffs with 25 percent levies of its own on select American goods, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25 percent tariffs against Can$155 billion (US$106 billion) worth of American goods," he said in a dramatic tone as he warned of a fracture in longstanding Canada-US ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first round of tariffs would target Can$30 billion worth of US goods on Tuesday followed by further tariffs on Can$125 billion worth of products in three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're certainly not looking to escalate. But we will stand up for Canada, for Canadians, for Canadian jobs," Trudeau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs will apply to "everyday items" such as American beer, wine and bourbon as well as fruits, vegetables, consumer appliances, lumber and plastics, he added -- "with much, much more."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump earlier announced broad tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, citing a threat from illegal immigration and drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian exports to the United States will face a 25 percent tariff starting Tuesday, although energy resources from Canada will have a lower 10 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said the trade conflict will have "real consequences" for Canadians but also for Americans, including job losses, higher costs for food and gasoline, potential shutdowns of auto assembly plants, and impeded access to Canadian nickel, potash, uranium, steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  He offered a reminder that Canada has been at the US's side in its "darkest hours" from the Iran hostage crisis and war in Afghanistan, to deadly natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the recent California wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're always there, standing with you," Trudeau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If President Trump wants to usher in a new golden age for the United States, the better path is to partner with Canada, not to punish us."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, the actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Trudeau consulted with provincial premiers, who each said afterward that they would take additional measures such as taking US booze off local store shelves and seeking to immediately diversify their trade relationships. (AFP)

    Rescuers build slope to reach man in Japan sinkhole

<img alt="The hole was initially around five metres in diameter but has combined with a larger cavity that opened during the rescue operation on Tuesday night.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese rescuers completed building a slope on Saturday to reach a truck driver stuck in a sinkhole, officials said, four days after his vehicle was swallowed by the cavity now 40 metres wide.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers have been struggling with the operation as the hole – now the length of an Olympic swimming pool – expands since opening up on Tuesday in Yashio city, on the outskirts of Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have just completed the work on the ramp," Saitama regional governor Motohiro Ono told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers will use the 30-metre slope to send heavy equipment into the hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to clear the debris and rescue the driver as soon as possible," Ono said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soil and debris covering the cabin of the 74-year-old driver have prevented any communication with him since midday on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Groundwater leaking into the sinkhole was mostly stopped on Saturday, public broadcaster NHK reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the walls of the hole – around 15 metres deep, according to NHK – eroding, rescue workers are unable to stay inside it for long.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hole was initially around five metres in diameter but combined with a larger cavity that opened during the rescue operation on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy chunks of asphalt have fallen inside, making it difficult for rescue workers and heavy machinery to go near the chasm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 1.2 million people living in the area have been asked to cut back on showers and laundry to prevent leaking sewage from hindering the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,600 cases of road sinkholes in 2022 were caused by sewer pipes, according to local media. Most were small, at only 50 centimetres deep or less.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2016, a giant sinkhole around 30 metres wide and 15 metres deep appeared on a busy street in Fukuoka city, triggered by nearby subway construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt and the street reopened a week after workers toiled around the clock. (AFP)

<img alt="Thousands of homes were destroyed by the Eaton Fire in the Altadena neighbourhood of Los Angeles County. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789917_1_20250201181526.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two devastating wildfires in Los Angeles were declared fully contained by firefighters on Friday after burning for more than three weeks, killing about 30 people and displacing thousands more.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Palisades and Eaton fires in Southern California's Los Angeles County were the most destructive in the history of the second-largest US city, burning more than 37,000 acres (150 square kilometres) and over 10,000 homes, causing damage estimated to cost hundreds of billions of US dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cal Fire, the state's firefighting agency, updated the figures on its website on Friday to show 100 percent containment of both fires, meaning their perimeters were completely under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuation orders were lifted earlier, with the fires not posing a serious threat for days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both blazes started on January 7 and their exact cause remains under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But human-driven climate change set the stage for the infernos by reducing rainfall, parching vegetation, and extending the dangerous overlap between flammable drought conditions and powerful Santa Ana winds, according to an analysis published this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study, conducted by dozens of researchers, concluded that the conditions fuelling the blazes were approximately 35 percent more likely due to global warming caused by burning fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two fires destroyed thousands of structures over more than three weeks in the affluent Pacific Palisades neighbourhood of Los Angeles and Malibu, and in the Altadena community in Los Angeles County, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our recovery effort is based around getting people back home to rebuild as quickly and safely as possible," Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement on Friday. "We are making sure that the Palisades will be safe as residents access their properties."
  <br>
  <br>
  City police chief Jim McDonnell said the presence of law enforcement officers in the area would be "more than 10 times" what it was before the start of the fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private meteorological firm AccuWeather has estimated the damage and economic loss at between US$250 billion and US$275 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A medical jet with six Mexican nationals on board crashed into a busy Philadelphia neighbourhood on Friday, authorities said, marking another US aviation disaster after a passenger plane and a military helicopter collided mid-air in Washington earlier this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Video footage appeared to show the twin-engine plane descending at a sharp angle towards a residential area, sparking a huge fireball upon impact and showering wreckage over homes and vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the aircraft was a Learjet 55 – an American-French business jet – that had taken off shortly before from Northeast Philadelphia Airport bound for Branson, Missouri.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash happened just after 6:00 pm (2300 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  A young girl who had been in the United States for medical care, her mother, and members of the flight and medical crews accompanying her on board were killed in the crash, said the children's hospital that had treated her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The patient had received care from Shriners Children's Philadelphia and was being transported back to her home country in Mexico on a contracted air ambulance when the crash happened," said Mel Bower, a spokesman for Shriners Children's.
  <br>
  <br>
  All six of those on board were Mexican citizens, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The airline company... confirmed to the consulate that six people of Mexican nationality were travelling on the aircraft," the ministry wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operator, Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, confirmed in a statement to US media that there were two passengers and four crew, adding, "At this time, we cannot confirm any survivors."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of emergency workers were on the scene outside Roosevelt Mall, a strip mall in Northeast Philadelphia with retailers and food outlets.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump posted on Friday on his Truth Social platform that he was "sad" to see "more souls lost" in the Philadelphia tragedy. He praised first responders, adding: "God Bless you all."
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses told local TV crews that they saw body parts in or near the wreckage, as Philadelphia City Council member Mike Driscoll said he feared residents or others on the ground may have been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't look good. And it's a sad situation here," he told CNN.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said it was launching an investigation with the National Transportation Safety Board. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian militant group Hamas handed over two Israeli hostages to the Red Cross, live television images showed on Saturday, with a third expected to be transferred later in the day.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ofer Kalderon, a French-Israeli dual national and Yarden Bibas were seen being handed over to a Red Cross official in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, in the latest stage of a phased exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  US-Israeli dual national Keith Siegel is expected to be handed over in another location later on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bibas is the father of the two youngest hostages, baby Kfir, only 9 months old when he was kidnapped by Hamas-led gunmen on October 7, 2023, and Ariel, who was 4 at the time of the cross-border attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas said in November 2023 that the boys and their mother Shiri, who was taken at the same time, were killed in an Israeli airstrike. There has been no word on them since.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel is expected to transfer 182 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, Hamas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday is also expected to see the first Palestinians travelling from Gaza to Egypt through the newly reopened Rafah crossing. It will be opened initially for 50 injured militants and 50 wounded civilians, along with the people escorting them, with a further 100 people, most likely students, probably allowed through on humanitarian grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventeen of the 33 hostages due for release in the first stage of the ceasefire have now been released in exchange for 400 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations are due to start by Tuesday on agreements for the release of more than 60 remaining hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in a second phase of the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial six-week ceasefire, agreed with Egyptian and Qatari mediators and backed by the United States, has so far stayed on track despite a number of incidents that have led both sides to accuse the other of violating the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the attack on October 7, 2023, Hamas killed some 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage, according to Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's campaign in response has destroyed much of the densely populated Gaza Strip and killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities. (Reuters)

    Trump announces tariffs for China, Canada and Mexico

<img alt="Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs on his return to the White House. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789863_1_20250201080440.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Trump will implement tariffs on Saturday on the three largest US trading partners -- Canada, Mexico and China -- saying there was nothing they could do to forestall him while vowing further levies on various industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has reiterated his plans for 25 percent tariffs on imports from neighboring Canada and Mexico, accusing them of failing to crack down on illegal migrants crossing the US border and on the flow of fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also threatened a 10 percent duty for Chinese goods on the same day - also over the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt affirmed on Friday that the tariffs would be imposed from Saturday, February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Canada and Mexico have allowed an unprecedented invasion of illegal fentanyl that is killing American citizens, and also immigrants into our country," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  She did not commit to exemptions on sectors, and rejected warnings that this would spark a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond the three countries, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that tariffs on oil and gas could arrive around February 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Eventually we're going to put tariffs on chips, we're going to put tariffs on oil and gas," he said, without specifying which countries he would target.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also vowed to impose higher duties on steel and aluminium, and eventually copper imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington was "absolutely" going to impose tariffs on the European Union in the future as well, Trump said, adding that the bloc "has treated us so terribly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed an "immediate response" if Trump acted, while Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government was in close contact with Trump's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has not specified tools he would use, though analysts suggest he could tap emergency economic powers, which allow the president to regulate imports during a national emergency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has rejected accusations of complicity in the fentanyl trade. Canada has also countered that below one percent of undocumented migrants and fentanyl entering the United States comes through its northern border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts believe tariff threats are a bargaining chip to accelerate the renegotiation of the existing trade deal, known as USMCA, between the United States, Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  But tariff hikes on the trading partners would likely prove a major shock, shaking up supply chains. (AFP)

    Green projects affecting Arctic's Sami people: Amnesty

<img alt="A Sami woman from the Vilhelmina Norra Sameby, observes the movement of the reindeers. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789842_1_20250131222318.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Climate change and efforts to curb it by moving away from fossil fuels are both threatening the rights and livelihood of Sami indigenous people in the Arctic, Amnesty International said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  There are about 100,000 Samis, considered Europe's last indigenous population, many of whom live from traditional reindeer herding, which requires vast open spaces.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the expansion of infrastructure for renewable energy production and mineral extraction is hindering their ancestral ways of living, said the report, which Amnesty International drafted in partnership with the non-governmental Sami Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Climate change threatens the culture and existence of the Sami indigenous people in two ways," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Firstly, through direct environmental impacts such as changing weather conditions and ecosystems, and secondly, through the increasing number of energy projects and resource extraction... in the name of 'green' development and 'clean' energy transition."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Samis and their migratory herds are spread across the vast open spaces of Arctic Finland, Norway, Russia and Sweden.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report - entitled "Just transition or 'green colonialism'?" - takes the example of the Fosen wind farms in Norway, where 151 turbines were installed on what opponents said was traditional reindeer habitat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norway's Supreme Court later ruled that the construction of the turbines was illegal, since it had no valid licences, and that it was violating Sami people's rights as granted by the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case triggered a vast mobilisation of environmental and Sami activists, who demanded the turbines be demolished.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended with a financial settlement with herders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report highlighted other conflicts surrounding mine projects in the Swedish village of Ronnbac, and in Kasivarsi, Finland - both of which threatened reindeer herding, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amnesty and the Sami Council urged authorities in Nordic countries to increase consultations with Sami populations and seek their agreement before granting any new infrastructure projects that could infringe on their rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  These disputes add to the direct effects of climate change, which in the Arctic manifest themselves three or four times faster than elsewhere in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other challenges, temperatures are rising, with "frequent temperatures around 0 degrees Celsius".
  <br>
  <br>
  If rain falls on existing snow, it freezes and forms an ice crust over the surface, meaning reindeer cannot reach lichen, their main food source.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early ice melting means river crossings are not covered by sufficiently solid ice or are flooded, making herding and reindeer migration perilous or even impossible. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Moscow on Friday accused Ukrainian troops of killing 22 people in an occupied Russian village, including eight women who were allegedly raped before being executed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine controls dozens of border settlements in the Kursk region of western Russia since launching a surprise offensive in August and says about 2,000 civilians still live in areas it occupies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has now retaken several towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Investigative Committee had said on January 19 it was investigating the killing of "at least seven civilians" in the village of Russkoye Porechnoye, about 20 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, it said it was now investigating the killing of "22 residents" between September and November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the victims, whose bodies were found in the basements of several homes, were eight women who were allegedly raped before being killed, the Investigative Committee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused the international community of ignoring Russia's claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This must be talked about, shown, despite all the deafness of the international community and its unwillingness to pay attention to such atrocities," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian investigators said five Ukrainian soldiers carried out the killings and that one of them, Yevgeny Fabrisenko, was arrested during the fighting in the Kursk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  The committee released a video of the interrogation of a man identified as Fabrisenko, who confessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a briefing on Friday, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: "First, people were tortured, abused, then killed either by being shot or blown up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of killing civilians since the conflict began nearly three years ago. (AFP)

 President Trump -- speaking as the bodies of 67 people were pulled from Washington's Potomac River -- on Thursday blamed diversity hires for the midair collision between an airliner and a military helicopter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials confirmed the deaths of all those aboard both aircraft, and also cited pilot error on the helicopter in the nighttime crash. The Chinese Embassy in the United States said two Chinese citizens were among the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump opend fire at what he said were left-wing diversity practices under his Democratic predecessors Joe Biden and Barack Obama that he claimed kept out good employees at the Federal Aviation Administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They actually came out with a directive: 'too white.' And we want the people that are competent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wreckage of the Bombardier jet operated by an American Airlines subsidiary protruded from the river surface, surrounded by emergency vessels and diving teams. It had been carrying 64 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army Blackhawk helicopter, which had three soldiers aboard, was also in the river.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now at a point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation," Washington Fire Chief John Donnelly said. Twenty eight bodies had already been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  The collision -- the first major crash in the United States since 2009 when 49 people were killed near Buffalo, New York -- occurred late evening on Wednesday as the airliner came into land at Reagan National Airport after a routine flight from Wichita, Kansas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reagan National is a major airport located a short distance from downtown Washington, the White House and the Pentagon. The airspace is extremely busy, with civilian and military aircraft a constant presence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic audio from air traffic controllers showed them repeatedly asking the helicopter if it had the passenger jet "in sight," and then just before the crash telling it to "pass behind" the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump opened his press conference by speaking of the nation's "anguish" and said that the investigation would take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he then launched into an extended broadside against so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump -- who began his presidency a week ago with an onslaught against decades-old measures aimed at preventing sexism and racism in the United States -- singled out Biden's openly gay transport secretary Pete Buttigieg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's run it right into the ground with his diversity," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buttigieg responded on X, calling Trump "despicable."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying," he said. (AFP, Xinhua)

 There are likely no survivors from a collision between a passenger jet and US Army helicopter in Washington DC, officials said on Thursday, as recovery operations pulled 28 bodies from the Potomac River into which both crashed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "At this point we don't believe there are any survivors," Washington Fire Chief John Donnelly told a news conference at Reagan National Airport, outside the US capital. "We are now at a point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Donnelly said 27 bodies were recovered from the plane and one from the helicopter. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Scores of people are feared dead after an American Airlines regional passenger jet and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter collided and crashed into the frigid Potomac River near Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday night, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials did not provide a death toll from the collision. But US Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas, where the flight originated, suggested that all on board died, saying at a news conference at Reagan airport early Thursday that "it's really hard when you lose probably over 60 Kansans simultaneously."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When one person dies, it's a tragedy, but when many, many, many people die, it's an unbearable sorrow," he said. "It's a heartbreak beyond measure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Potter, the president and CEO of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, emphasised at the same news conference that first responders were in "rescue mode."
  <br>
  <br>
  CBS News had reported that at least 18 bodies had been recovered, citing a police official. Two sources told Reuters multiple bodies had been pulled from the water.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Airlines confirmed that 64 people were aboard the jet: 60 passengers and four crew members. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter, which was on a training flight, a US official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mid-air collision occurred as the passenger jet en route from Wichita, Kansas was on approach to land at Reagan. Radio communications between the air traffic control tower and the Black Hawk show that the helicopter crew were aware that the plane was in the vicinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pentagon said it was launching an immediate investigation into the incident, which President Donald Trump appeared to blame on the helicopter crew and air traffic controllers in a post on Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The helicopter was going straight at the airplane for an extended period of time. It is a CLEAR NIGHT, the lights on the plane were blazing, why didn't the helicopter go up or down, or turn," Trump wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why didn't the control tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the plane. This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Air traffic control recordings appear to capture the final attempted communications with the helicopter, call sign PAT25, before it collides with the plane, described as CRJ.
  <br>
  <br>
  "PAT25, do you have a CRJ in sight? PAT25, pass behind the CRJ," an air traffic controller says at 8:47 pm (0147 GMT), according to a recording on liveatc.net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seconds later, another aircraft calls in to air traffic control, saying, "Tower, did you see that?" - apparently referring to the crash. An air traffic controller then redirects planes heading to runway 33 to go around.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video of the crash captured by a webcam at the nearby Kennedy Center showed the moment of impact between the aircraft and the helicopter, with a massive explosion lighting up the night sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just after the collision, an air traffic controller was heard saying over the radio, "I just saw a fireball and then it was just gone. I haven't seen anything since they hit the river."
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives gathered at the airport said they were getting little to no information from officials about the incident, adding that they were hearing more about the incident from news reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  One woman told an airport official, "I don't know if she got on there or not," in apparent reference to a passenger on the crashed jet. She then collapsed in tears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington, DC, fire chief John Donnelly said at the news conference that at least 300 first responders were continuing to work on the "highly complex" rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Conditions out there are extremely rough for the responders," Donnelly said. "It's cold. They're dealing with windy conditions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by reporters whether there were any survivors, he responded that "we don't know yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 1:30 am ET, a Reuters reporter near the airport saw a helicopter circling in the sky and shining a spotlight into the water. A boat with a rescue team floated by with those aboard peering into the water with a flashlight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, dozens of police, ambulance and rescue units, some ferrying boats, staged along the river and raced to positions along the tarmac of Reagan airport. Live TV images showed several boats in the water, flashing blue and red lights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airports authority CEO Potter said the airport would remain closed until at least 11 am on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River, killing 70 passengers and four crew members. Only four passengers and one crew member survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last deadly major crash involving a commercial airliner in the US was in 2009, when all 49 people aboard a Colgan Air flight died when the plane crashed in New York state. One person also died on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a series of near-miss incidents in recent years have raised serious safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSA was operating Flight 5342 for American Airlines, according to the FAA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're cooperating with the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation and will continue to provide all the information we can," American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said in a video statement. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A US passenger plane carrying 64 people crashed into Washington DC's chilly Potomac River after colliding mid-air with a military helicopter on a night-time training exercise on Wednesday, prompting a major emergency response and the grounding of all flights.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plane had been about to land at nearby Reagan National Airport after flying from Kansas.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Airlines, whose subsidiary operated the flight, said "there were 60 passengers and four crew members on board the aircraft."
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Army official said the helicopter involved was a Black Hawk model carrying three soldiers -- their status currently unknown. They had been on a "training flight," a separate military spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington police said "there is no confirmed information on casualties at this time."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a massive search and rescue operation was in progress, with divers visible as they plunged into the Potomac.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Washington Post quoted unnamed sources saying police had started to pull multiple bodies from the snow-lined Potomac.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witness Ari Schulman described "a stream of sparks" and what looked like a large firework when the collision erupted overhead as he drove home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Initially I saw the plane and it looked fine, normal. It was right about to head over land," he told CNN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Three seconds later, and at that point it was banked all the way to the right... I could see the underside of it, it was lit up a very bright yellow, and there was a stream of sparks underneath it," Schulman added. "It looked like a Roman candle."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump said in a statement that he had been "fully briefed" and said of any victims, "may God bless their souls."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of all planes at Reagan National, and Washington's police said on X that "multiple agencies" were responding to the crash site in the Potomac.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kristi Noem, the country's new secretary of homeland security, posted on X that she was "deploying every available US Coast Guard resource for search and rescue efforts in this horrific incident at DCA."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said fireboats had joined the operation on the river, where any work was complicated by the fact it was dark and close to freezing. Dozens of fire trucks headed toward the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said a Bombardier regional jet operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines "collided in midair" with a Sikorsky UH-60 helicopter as it approached for landing at Reagan at around 9:00 pm (0200 GMT). The plane had left from Wichita, Kansas.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas said the collision was "nothing short of a nightmare."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I ask the world to join me in praying for Kansas this evening, the first responders, rescue crews, and all those involved in this horrific accident," he wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions were expected to focus on how a passenger plane with modern collision-avoidance technology and nearby traffic controllers could collide with a military aircraft over the nation's capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the airspace around Washington is often crowded, with planes coming in low over the city to land at Reagan airport and helicopters -- military, civilian and carrying senior politicians -- buzzing about both day and night.
  <br>
  <br>
  The same airport was the scene of a deadly crash in January 1982 when Air Florida flight 90, a Boeing 737, took off but quickly plummeted, hitting the 14th Street bridge and crashing through the ice into the Potomac River. 78 people died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators concluded the pilot had failed to activate sufficient de-icing procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last major fatal US crash was in 2009, when Continental Flight 3407 from New Jersey to Buffalo, New York crashed and killed all 49 people aboard. (AFP)

 More than 500,000 displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza, according to the media office in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  "More than half a million displaced Palestinians have returned in the past 72 hours from the southern and central governorates to Gaza and northern governorates via Al-Rashid and Salah Al-Din roads," the media office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel began allowing displaced people to return to the north of the Gaza Strip on Monday, following a ceasefire agreement with Hamas that put a pause on 15 months of fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said it would release three Israeli detainees on Thursday. Israeli public radio reported that Israel would free 110 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 minors, in exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's health authorities said hospitals received 63 bodies in the past 24 hours, including 59 recovered from rubble, bringing the total death toll since October 2023, to 47,417.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, at least ten Palestinians on Wednesday were killed and several others injured in the occupied West Bank by an Israeli strike, Palestinian health officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said it had targeted a cell of "armed terror operatives".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian health ministry added that Israeli forces killed two people in separate overnight raids in the occupied West Bank, including one at a refugee camp in Jenin, where the Israeli military is conducting a major offensive. (Agencies)

 Rwanda-backed fighters advanced on a second front in their offensive across eastern DR Congo on Wednesday after seizing control of most of the key city of Goma during heavy fighting with the Congolese military.
 <br>
  <br>
  The weeks-long advance by the M23 armed group prompted calls from mediator Angola for urgent talks, as well rising international criticism and warnings of a looming humanitarian crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  DR Congo has called on the world to stop the M23's march across the vast central African country's mineral-rich east, wracked by decades of conflict that can be partly traced back to the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
  <br>
  <br>
  After days of intense clashes, calm returned to Goma, provincial capital of North Kivu, on Wednesday as residents started venturing from their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite international pressure to end the crisis, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi declined to attend talks with his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a videoconference summit of the East African Community, the regional bloc's heads state "called for peaceful settlement of the conflicts", it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  M23 fighters and Rwandan troops entered Goma on Sunday, progressively seizing the city's airport and other sites of the key mineral trading hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest fighting has heightened an already dire humanitarian crisis in the region, causing food and water shortages and forcing half a million people from their homes this month, according to the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other side of the country, furious protesters in the capital Kinshasa on Tuesday attacked the embassies of various nations they accused of not stepping in to halt the chaos in the east.
  <br>
  <br>
  After protesters burnt tyres in the streets and looted supermarkets, the authorities banned all further protests in the capital, which remained calm on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, which was among the nations whose embassy was targeted, ordered non-emergency staff and their families to leave the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  DR Congo's former colonial ruler Belgium also warned its citizens against travelling to the country, while Brussels Airlines scrapped flights to Kinshasa. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pre-dawn stampede at the world's largest religious gathering killed at least 30 people in India on Wednesday, with many more injured after a surging crowd spilled out of a police cordon and trampled bystanders.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deadly crowd incidents are a frequent occurrence at Indian religious festivals, including the Kumbh Mela, which attracts tens of millions of devotees every 12 years to the northern city of Prayagraj.
  <br>
  <br>
  As pilgrims rushed to participate in a sacred day of ritual bathing, people sleeping and sitting on the ground near the rivers said they were trampled by huge swells of devotees coming towards them in the darkness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entire crowd fell on top of me, trampling me as it moved forward," pilgrim Renu Devi, 48, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the crowd surged, elderly people and women were crushed, and no one came forward to help."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue teams carrying victims from the accident site weaved through piles of clothes, shoes and other discarded belongings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were seen carrying stretchers bearing the bodies of victims draped with thick blankets.

  <br>
  "Thirty devotees have unfortunately died," senior police officer Vaibhav Krishna told reporters during an evening news conference at the festival. "Ninety injured were taken to the hospital."
  <br>
  <br>
  Krishna's briefing came nearly 18 hours after the stampede and was the first official death toll given by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Festivities had otherwise been allowed to continue almost as normal during the day, with millions still trekking to the riverbanks to immerse themselves in the water.

  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the stampede "extremely sad" and offered his "deepest condolences" to relatives of those killed. (AFP)

 At least seven people were killed and around 10 injured in a stampede at the Maha Kumbh Mela in northern India on Wednesday, said an official, as tens of millions gathered to take a holy dip on the most auspicious day of the six-week Hindu festival.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stampede occurred between 1 am and 2 am near the arena of the ascetics, where barricades had been put up to manage crowds during their holy dip, said Yogi Adityanath, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state where the festival city of Prayagraj is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, offered condolences to "devotees who have lost their loves ones", but did not specify the number of dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The local administration is engaged in helping the victims in every possible way", he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adityanath added that the situation was under control but the crowd was still massive.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior state official said "more than seven people have been killed in the stampede and around 10 others injured". The official did not want to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos and photographs after the stampede showed bodies being taken away on stretchers and people sitting on the ground crying, while others stepped over clothes, shoes, backpacks and blankets left by those trying to escape the crush.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Reuters witness saw several dead bodies as he followed dozens of ambulances rushing towards the river bank where the incident occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses spoke of a huge push near the confluence of three holy rivers - where a dip is considered particularly sacred - that caused devotees to fall on each other. Chief Minister Adityanath urged people to avoid the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hindu festival is the world's largest congregation of humanity, attracting some 400 million over its six weeks compared with the Haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia which drew 1.8 million last year. By Tuesday nearly 200 million people have attended the 2025 festival since it started two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devout Hindus believe taking a dip at the confluence of three sacred rivers - the Ganga, the Yamuna, and the mythical, invisible Saraswati - absolves people of sins, and during the Kumbh, it also brings salvation from the cycle of life and death.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar stampede broke out on the most auspicious day of the festival when it was last held in 2013, killing at least 36 pilgrims, mostly women.  (Reuters)

    South Korea investigates Air Busan plane fire

<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven people sustained mostly minor injuries in Tuesday's airplane fire in South Korea, authorities said on Wednesday, with local media suggesting the blaze may have been caused by a portable battery stored in the overhead bin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Air Busan plane, an Airbus A321, was set to fly to Hong Kong from Gimhae International Airport in southeastern Busan but caught fire in the rear section on Tuesday night, according to the country's transport ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 169 passengers and seven flight attendants and staff were evacuated down inflatable slides, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities initially reported three injuries but revised the number to seven on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them is currently hospitalised, the ministry added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident left nearly half of the fuselage burnt but its wings and engines on both sides remain undamaged, it said, adding that the cause of the fire is currently under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unclear when we will be able to disclose the investigation findings on the cause of last night's fire," the ministry spokesperson told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic images and footage from local media on Tuesday night showed the aircraft engulfed in flames, with thick smoke appearing to billow from the interior of the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Images from Wednesday morning revealed that the upper half of the fuselage was burned away, leaving a huge hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the ministry did not comment on the possible cause of the fire, Yonhap News Agency reported that the blaze began to spread after black smoke emerged from the overhead compartment in the back row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems that a fire broke out when a passenger's portable battery, stored in the overhead bin as carry-on luggage, became compressed," local daily JoongAng Ilbo reported, citing an unnamed person affiliated with Air Busan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the smoke filled the cabin, a passenger seated near the emergency exit opened the door, and the flight attendant opened the opposite one, allowing others to start evacuating," a passenger recounted, as quoted by Yonhap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was... chaotic and terrifying."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea suffered the worst aviation disaster on its soil last month when a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800, flying from Thailand to Muan on December 29, crash-landed and exploded into a fireball after slamming into a concrete barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  That crash killed 179 of the 181 passengers and crew members on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the wake of the Jeju Air passenger aircraft tragedy, an additional aviation accident has taken place, and we feel deeply sorry for the passengers on board and the public," transport minister Park Sang-woo said in a statement Wednesday. (AFP)

    Macron pledges Louvre 'renaissance' after decay alarm

<img alt="Standing in front of the Mona Lisa, French President Emmanuel Macron said plans included a " for src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789518_1_20250129023336.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that the Louvre would be "redesigned, restored and enlarged" after the director of the world's most visited museum voiced alarm about dire conditions for visitors and its collections.
 <br>
  <br>
  Standing in front of the Mona Lisa, Macron said plans included a "special space" for Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece that would be "independently accessible compared to the rest of the museum", with "its own access pass".
  <br>
  <br>
  The museum in central Paris would also have a "new grand entrance" to help ease congestion at its glass-and-metal pyramid entry point and be financed entirely using the institution's "own resources".
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the so-called "New Renaissance" project, France would over the next few months launch an "international architecture competition" and select winners by the end of the year to transform its buildings by 2031 at the latest, Macron said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seat of French kings until Louis XIV abandoned it for Versailles in the late 1600s, the Louvre is regularly listed as the world's most visited museum, and houses masterpieces including the Mona Lisa and the Greek marble sculpture of Venus de Milo.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Paris landmark has become a subject of national concern after the revelation last week of a confidential memo written by its director Laurence des Cars to Culture Minister Rachida Dati warning about the "proliferation of damage in museum spaces".
  <br>
  <br>
  Some areas "are no longer watertight, while others experience significant temperature variations, endangering the preservation of artworks", she wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Louvre's popularity is causing also a "physical strain" on the historic building, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Des Cars said the Louvre required an overhaul that was likely to be costly and technically complicated.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 8.7 million people visited its famed galleries last year, around twice the number it was designed for, and des Cars has expressed concern about the quality of the user experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Louvre management estimates the renovation work could cost hundreds of millions of euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron said "a different, higher fee for foreign visitors from countries outside the European Union" starting next year would help cover the costs. (AFP)

    Judge pauses Trump funding freeze order until Feb 3

<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge on Tuesday paused until next week the implementation of a Trump administration order that would have frozen the issuance of federal grants and loans.
 <br>
  <br>
  Judge Loren AliKhan’s ruling during a hearing conducted on Zoom came just minutes before the freezing order was set to take effect at 5 p.m. ET.
  <br>
  <br>
  AliKhan said her administrative stay of the order would expire at 5 p.m. on Monday unless she decides to grant a temporary restraining order as requested by plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging the Trump administration’s action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the healthcare system for millions of low-income Americans and rafts of other programs were thrown into disarray on Tuesday after President Donald Trump ordered a freeze on federal funding, a move opponents blasted as unconstitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Trump's latest step since he took office a week ago, vowing to force the US government and its employees to back his political goals or face retribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online portals used to access the Medicaid health insurance program for poor families and disabled individuals were quickly inaccessible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a blatant attempt to rip away health insurance from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed," Oregon Senator Ron Wyden posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the website would be fixed soon and that "no payments have been affected."
  <br>
  <br>
  She defended the drastic move as part of Trump's bid to make the government "good stewards of taxpayer dollars."
  <br>
  <br>
  The freeze is not a "blanket" stop on spending, but a tool to check that "every penny that is going out the door is not conflicting with the executive orders and actions that this president has taken," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the temporary pause would not impact individual Americans but would instead target programs to weed out anything "illegal."
  <br>
  <br>
  She listed as examples racial equality and climate change programs that Trump has vowed to eradicate, and did not answer a question about whether Medicaid recipients would be cut off.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extraordinary measure follows a similar freeze on most US foreign aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order, signed by acting director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Matthew Vaeth, did not make clear how such a pause on disbursements of funding will work or for how long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several non-profit groups have filed suit in federal court seeking a temporary halt to the order until its legality is assessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federal spending included more than US$3 trillion in financial assistance like grants and loans in fiscal year 2024, all of which was approved by Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats accused Trump of usurping Congress' constitutionally mandated control over budget spending as part of a broader attempt to force the government to bend to his personal will. (AFP)
