    UK ready to send troops to Ukraine: Starmer

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ready to send UK troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force as he tried to show the US that European nations should have a role in the talks on ending the conflict.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said he had not taken the decision to consider putting British servicemen and women "in harm's way" lightly, but securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter further aggression.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday said Ukraine and Europe would be part of any "real negotiations" to end Moscow's war, signalling that US talks with Russia this week were a chance to see how serious Putin is about peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  The end of Russia's war with Ukraine "when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again," Starmer wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer's comments were the first time he has explicitly said he is considering deploying British peacekeepers to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has previously said that Britain was willing to help play a part in any peace deal that is negotiated.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Starmer said he was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by "putting our own troops on the ground if necessary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do not say that lightly," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer is expected to join German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other European leaders in Paris on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron convened talks on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump stunned European allies in Nato and Ukraine last week when he announced he had held a call with Putin without consulting them and would start a peace process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, then suggested Ukraine and other European leaders would have no place at peace negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and Russian officials are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to start talks aimed at ending Russia's nearly three-year war in Ukraine. (Reuters)

    'Conclave' and 'Brutalist' share Bafta honours

<img alt='The cast and crew of "Conclave" pose for a picture after the movie won the Best Film award at the 2025 Bafta awards. Photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791943_1_20250217110853.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Papal thriller "Conclave" and immigrant epic "The Brutalist" on Sunday tied for top honours at Britain's Bafta awards with each film picking up four coveted gongs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Conclave", directed by German-born Edward Berger, won the Bafta for the best film with its tale of the intrigue and horse-trading behind the scenes during the election of a new pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accepting the award, Berger recalled the journey to make the film took seven years, paying tribute to British screenplay writer Peter Straughan's "wonderful script" and lead actor Ralph Fiennes.
  <br>
  <br>
  US filmmaker Brady Corbet took the Bafta for best director for "The Brutalist", while leading man Adrien Brody scooped up the best actor gong for his portrayal of a Hungarian Holocaust survivor and architect who emigrates to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brody told a winners press conference that the film was "an opportunity for me to honour my own ancestral struggles".
  <br>
  <br>
  In "a film that speaks to tremendous cruelty and despicable behaviour in our past... we see elements existing today that can guide us and remind us of that," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran British actor Fiennes, who played a cardinal in "Conclave", once again saw his hopes of winning a Bafta gong dashed, losing out to Brody in the race for the honour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scandal-hit "Emilia Perez", a surreal musical about a Mexican druglord who transitions to a woman, had been heavily favoured at the beginning of the year. But it ended the evening with just two Baftas, including one for Zoe Saldana for best supporting actress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until last month, French director Jacques Audiard's movie had been expected to be a frontrunner having won 11 nominations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But old racist and Islamophobic tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascon surfaced at the end of January, shaking up the race just before the London ceremony and the Oscars on March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  A surprise of the night was the Bafta for best actress which went to 25-year-old Mikey Madison for her portrayal of a sex worker in the black comedy "Anora" about an erotic dancer's whirlwind romance gone wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madison, who beat out frontrunner Demi Moore, told reporters she wanted to dedicate the award to "the sex worker community, I see you, you deserve respect and human dignity". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 India's capital New Delhi was jolted awake on Monday by powerful tremors from a magnitude 4.0 earthquake, with its epicentre on the edge of the sprawling megacity an hour before dawn.
 <br>
  <br>
  There were no immediate reports of major damage, but terrified residents rushed outside as buildings shook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Survey said the quake struck at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to follow "safety precautions" and stay alert to "possible aftershocks".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tremors were felt in Delhi and nearby areas. Urging everyone to stay calm and follow safety precautions, staying alert for possible aftershocks. Authorities are keeping a close watch on the situation," Modi said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police issued an emergency number to call for help, saying: "We hope you all are safe, Delhi."
  <br>
  <br>
  Northern India lies on a major geological faultline where the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence. (AFP)

    Asian-American women in the spotlight at US awards

<img alt="Honourees of the Outstanding Asian American Women Who Dared gala say the event comes at a crucial time, as US President Donald Trump aggressively moves to stamp out diversity, equity and inclusiveness. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791931_1_20250217101545.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A special event in the United States has been shining a spotlight on the achievements of Asian American women, in areas ranging from academics to sports.
 <br>
  <br>
  The awards gala for the Outstanding Asian American Women Who Dared – held in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley on February 27 – recognised 12 people, who said the event comes at a crucial time, especially with US President Donald Trump aggressively moving to stamp out traces of diversity, equity and inclusiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re entering a very special era in history, and it just makes us have to really step in and step up and work harder,” honouree Liu Xin – the founder of the Enlight Foundation, which focuses on education equality and helping youth engage in developing climate solutions – said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A presenter at the show, Fiona Ma, is the first Asian American Woman to be elected treasurer of California.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s been very difficult for me being an Asian woman moving up the ranks and politics. And, you know, tonight is about recognising other trailblazers and people who are really making a mark.”
  <br>
  <br>
  And one of those making a mark is Sue Xu, the managing partner of venture capital firm Amino Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has contributed to the success of at least 45 companies with a total value of more than US$100 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has also addressed the United Nations about the role of artificial intelligence in combatting human trafficking and promoting the welfare of women.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel like, woman's voice hasn’t been heard. Especially nowadays, when you're talking about DeepSeek, talking about AI. And then I feel like a lot of times woman is victims of AI. And then, you know, South Korea, they just passed that out, criminalising possession for, you know, deep-fake pornography. I feel like as a woman, if we lead with responsibility, we have a chance,” Xu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While many of the honourees stem from the world of business and technology, artists were celebrated too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honouree Chen Jiebing is one of the foremost erhu virtuosos in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai native has been nominated for a Grammy and recently had the honour of Nasa using her music to celebrate its 60th anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want the world to see and hear the unique vocal expressions of this instrument and it’s versatility to incorporate with other Western styles of music such as jazz, and even American Blue Grass country style music.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like all the honourees, Chen has daring goals. Her’s is to someday elevate the erhu to be as widely recognised worldwide as the violin.

<img alt="US President Donald Trump said he believed both the Russian and Ukrainian presidents wanted to stop fighting. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791920_1_20250217090607.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he could meet "very soon" with Vladimir Putin, adding he believes his Russian counterpart genuinely wants to stop fighting in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No time set, but it could be very soon," Trump told reporters, hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to play down expectations of upcoming high-level talks in Riyadh on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Rubio set to lead a high-level American delegation at the discussions with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia's capital in the coming days, a flurry of diplomacy was taking place as the Ukraine war nears its third anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, addressing reporters after a flight on Air Force One, said his team had been speaking "long and hard" with Russian officials, including his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff whom the president said met with Putin for about three hours recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he wants to stop fighting," Trump said of Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he believes Putin wants to seize the entirety of Ukraine, Trump said: "That was my question to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If he's going to go on... that would have caused me a big problem," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he wants to end it, and they want to end it fast. Both of them," he said, adding "Zelensky wants to end it too."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile said Sunday he believed Russia was preparing to "wage war" against a weakened NATO should Trump dilute US support for the alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump appeared to dismiss Zelensky's remarks, telling reporters he was "not even a little bit" concerned about the Ukrainian leader's messaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio is set to lead a high-level US team to Riyadh, but it remains unclear whether there will be any Ukrainian participation. Rubio said he wasn't even sure who Moscow was sending. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a united front on Sunday against their common enemies, threatening to "open the gates of hell" on Hamas and "finish the job" against Iran.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pledges came during a joint address to reporters in Jerusalem, where Rubio began his first Middle East trip as Secretary of State in President Donald Trump's new administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas cannot continue as a military or a government force... they must be eliminated," Rubio said of the Palestinian Islamist group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comment came a day after Hamas freed three Israeli hostages in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners, the sixth such swap under the ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of ceasefire violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding to strain on the deal, Trump has made a widely-condemned proposal to take control of Gaza and relocate its more than two million residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanking Rubio for "unequivocal backing" for Israel's policy in Gaza, Netanyahu added that Israel and the United States are determined to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions and its "aggression" in the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel and America stand shoulder to shoulder in countering the threat of Iran," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agreed that the ayatollahs must not have nuclear weapons and also agreed that Iran's aggression in the region must be rolled back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli-Iranian enmity stretches back decades through a history of clandestine wars and attacks by land, sea, air and cyberspace.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis sat out mass and his traditional Angelus prayer from hospital on Sunday, with a Vatican health official saying the 88-year-old pontiff needed to preserve his strength for the Church's busy Jubilee year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis was admitted on Friday to Rome's Gemelli hospital with bronchitis, one of several bouts of flu or bronchitis he has caught in recent winters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican said Saturday that doctors prescribed "absolute rest", although they said tests had indicated some improvements in his condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to attend Sunday mass at St Peter's Basilica, the pope sent a written address to a group of artists and other cultural figures in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would have liked to be among you but, as you know, I am here at the Gemelli Hospital because I still need some treatment for my bronchitis," Francis wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the mass -- which is usually presided over by the pope -- Cardinal Jose Tolentino de Mendonca read Francis's homily.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We live in a time when new walls are being erected, when differences become a pretext for division rather than an opportunity for mutual enrichment," the cardinal read. "But you, men and women of the world of culture, are called to build bridges."
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the health office for the Italian Bishops' Conference, Massimo Angelelli, told AFPTV it was "absolutely necessary for him to recover his strength" as "the Jubilee is still long."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Catholic Church has designated 2025 a "Jubilee Year" that is expected to draw more than 30 million visitors to Rome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Occurring every 25 years, the Jubilee is intended as a period of reflection and penance, and marked by a long list of cultural and religious events -- many of them presided over by the pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite his health issues -- which include knee pain and his reliance on a wheelchair -- the pope keeps a very busy schedule and has said he has no current plans to slow down.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the days ahead of his hospitalisation, Francis -- who had part of one of his lungs removed as a young man -- several times asked aides to read his public speeches aloud on his behalf.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the Vatican said in a statement that tests had confirmed the pope was suffering from a "respiratory tract infection" but was not exhibiting signs of fever, and showed "improvement in some values". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Mauritius arrested the island's former prime minister Pravind Jugnauth in a money-laundering probe and seized stacks of cash from a business linked to him, they said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers arrested the 63-year-old along with his wife Kobita Jugnauth in the early hours of Sunday and questioned him for several hours, police sources who asked not to be named told AFP. Kobita Jugnauth was later released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pravind Jugnauth was due to appear before a judge later in the morning, the sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police incident report seen by AFP detailed a search by officers at the home of another suspect, in which documents were found bearing the names of the Jugnauths, as well as luxury watches and stacks of various currencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The island's Financial Crimes Commission had asked police to detain the Jugnauths and two other suspects if they tried to leave the country, in a notice issued on Saturday, citing investigations into "a case of money-laundering".
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime minister from 2017 to 2024, Pravind Jugnauth is a member of one of the dynasties that have dominated the leadership of Mauritius since it became independent from Britain in 1968.
  <br>
  <br>
  He oversaw a historic deal with Britain for Mauritius to regain sovereignty over the Chagos Islands following a long-running dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his Militant Socialist Movement suffered a crushing defeat in tense elections in November. He ceded office to centre-left rival Navin Ramgoolam, who became prime minister for the third time.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the campaign, both camps promised to improve the lives of ordinary Mauritians who face cost-of-living difficulties despite strong economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Chagos deal, Britain will retain a lease for a joint US military base on the island of Diego Garcia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Mauritius and Britain have said US President Donald Trump's administration will have a say on the final terms of the agreement. (AFP)

<img alt='British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says London "will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together". File photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791827_1_20250216082626.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European leaders on Saturday mobilised to force their way to the table at any talks on the Ukraine war, as Washington announced a team of senior US officials was planning to meet in Saudi Arabia with counterparts from Moscow and Kiev.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump upended the status quo this week when he announced he was likely to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin soon to start talks to end the conflict, leaving US allies in Europe reeling from concerns that their interests would be sidelined in any deal on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will head to Saudi Arabia for ceasefire talks with Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, US officials said on Saturday, without giving details on when the meeting would happen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio had already been due to visit Saudi Arabia as part his first tour of the Middle East, which began on Saturday when he arrived in Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top US diplomat also had a call on Saturday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, in which he "reaffirmed President Trump's commitment to finding an end to the conflict in Ukraine," spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Munich, Nato chief Mark Rutte said Europe had to come up with "good proposals" for securing peace in Ukraine if it wanted to be involved in US-led talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Europeans want to have a say, make yourself relevant," Rutte told journalists at a gathering of top policymakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rutte also said he would head to Paris on Monday to take part in a meeting of European leaders convened by French President Emmanuel Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gathering would focus on defence spending and planning so that "when a deal is reached in Ukraine, that we have absolute clarity what Europe can contribute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Europe "must take on a greater role in Nato" and work with the United States to "secure Ukraine's future".
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Starmer said: "This is a once in a generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russi
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of any eventual "security guarantees" for Ukraine, talks have begun in Europe over a potential deployment of peacekeepers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But those discussions are at an embryonic stage -- and others argue the focus needs to be on building up Ukraine's own forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for the creation of a European army, arguing the continent could no longer count on Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really believe that time has come. The Armed Forces of Europe must be created."
  <br>
  <br>
  The push for a joint continental force has been mooted for years without gaining traction and Zelensky's intervention seems unlikely to shift the balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's rallying cry came a day after he met US Vice President JD Vance as Kyiv scrambles to ensure it is not sidelined in Washington's push to wrap up the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement," Zelensky said in a speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. No decisions about Europe without Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, gave Europeans reasons to doubt they would be heard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe would not be directly involved in talks but would still have an "input", Kellogg said in Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials have sought to assure Ukraine that it will not be left in the cold after three years of battling Russia's invasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance said after his sit-down with Zelensky that the United States was looking for a "durable, lasting peace" that would not lead to further bloodshed in coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Washington has sent mixed messages to Kyiv, with Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth appearing to rule out Ukraine joining Nato or having all of its territoroy restoreD.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also pushed for access to Ukraine's stocks of rare earth minerals as compensation for the military aid provided by the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said ON Saturday he blocked a deal that would have given the US access to vast amounts of Ukrainian natural resources as it lacked "security guarantees" for Kyiv. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 14-year-old boy died, and five other people were injured in a knife attack in southern Austria on Saturday, police said, adding they have arrested a 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A man randomly attacked passersby with a knife," police spokesman Rainer Dionisio told AFP of the incident in the city of Villach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One victim, a 14-year-old boy, died," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other men suffered serious injuries, while another two men were lightly injured, Dionisio added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened on Saturday just before 4pm local time (2300 HKT) in the centre of the city, the capital of Carinthia Province.
  <br>
  <br>
  A food delivery rider saw the attack and rammed his vehicle into the attacker, who was lightly injured and was arrested "right after the attack," according to Dionisio.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man under arrest is a Syrian asylum seeker with a valid residence permit and without a criminal record, according to preliminary information, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest victim was the 14-year-old, while the oldest is 32 years old, he said. (AFP)

<img alt="Donald Trump, who took office on January 20, has repeatedly vowed to swiftly end the Ukraine war. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791825_1_20250216075612.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to start talks aimed at ending Moscow's nearly three-year war in Ukraine, a US lawmaker and a source familiar with the planning said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who met with US Vice President JD Vance in Germany on Friday, said Ukraine was not invited to the talks in Saudi Arabia and Kyiv would not engage with Russia before consulting with strategic partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Saudi Arabia, US Representative Michael McCaul told Reuters. It was not immediately clear who they would meet from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, McCaul said the aim of the talks was to arrange a meeting between US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy "to finally bring peace and end this conflict."
  <br>
  <br>
  A source with knowledge of the plans confirmed the planned talks in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials. The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who took office on January 20, has repeatedly vowed to swiftly end the Ukraine war. He made separate phone calls to Putin and Zelenskiy on Wednesday, leaving Washington's European allies alarmed that they will be cut out of any peace process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those fears were largely confirmed on Saturday when Trump's Ukraine envoy said Europe won't have a seat at the table, after Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Saturday Rubio spoke with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. They agreed on regular contacts to prepare for a meeting between Putin and Trump, Russia's Foreign Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelenskiy said on Friday he would visit the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, but did not say when. However, the Ukrainian leader said he had no plans to meet with US or Russian officials during those visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow controls a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly advancing in the east for months, while Kyiv's smaller army grapples with manpower shortages and tries to hold a chunk of territory in western Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has demanded Kyiv cede territory and become permanently neutral under any peace deal. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured land and wants NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent attack by Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States and Europe have given Ukraine tens of billions of dollars in military aid since the war started. Trump has said he backs Ukraine but is seeking security for US funding for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and Ukraine are currently negotiating a deal that could open up Ukraine's vast natural wealth to US investment. Three sources said the US proposed taking ownership of 50 percent of Ukraine's critical minerals. Zelenskiy said on Saturday that the draft deal did not contain the security provisions Kyiv needed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK government on Saturday named two Britons detained in Iran as Craig and Lindsay Foreman, with their family saying they are determined to ensure the pair's "safe return."
 <br>
  <br>
  The two are currently being held in the city of Kerman, the family said in a statement issued by the British foreign ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The family added that it was "united in our determination to secure their safe return."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We truly appreciate the outpouring of support from friends, family, and the community, which has provided us with strength and encouragement as we face this ordeal," said the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple are in their early 50s and were on a motorbike tour around the world when they were detained in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Foreign Office confirmed on Friday that it was "providing consular assistance to two British nationals detained in Iran" and was in contact with Iranian authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after Iran's official news agency IRNA reported on Thursday that two British nationals were being held in central Kerman province for unspecified security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK government advises against all travel to Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  It says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are "at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention."
  <br>
  <br>
  Several other Europeans are held in custody in Iran, which has conducted multiple prisoner exchanges with Western governments in recent years. (AFP)

<img alt="German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pushed back against US Vice President JD Vance's broadside against Germany and the EU on Friday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791795_1_20250215201949.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday said that Germany rejects "outsiders intervening in our democracy," a day after US Vice President JD Vance in a blistering speech told Europe to open the door to far-right parties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholz, who faces elections on February 23, spoke in Munich where Vance on Friday launched his broadside against Germany and the EU on immigration, free speech and other topics in a speech later praised by US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance also met Alice Weidel, the top candidate of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has also received strong backing from technology billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Scholz pushed back against Vance's speech and defended Germany's taboo against cooperating with extremist parties, often dubbed a "firewall."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not accept outsiders intervening in our democracy, in our elections," Scholz said. "That is not appropriate – especially not among friends and allies."
  <br>
  <br>
  France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also defended European policies after Vance's speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Freedom of expression is guaranteed in Europe," Barrot said on X, after Vance alleged it was "in retreat." "Nobody is obliged to adopt our model, but nobody can impose theirs on us," the French minister added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz started his speech by mentioning Vance's earlier visit to the Nazis' Dachau concentration camp near Munich, and the US vice president's commitment to "never again" allow such crimes to be committed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Holocaust was the reason "the vast majority of Germans are firmly opposed to those who glorify or justify" the Nazis, Scholz said, recalling that AfD senior figures have trivialised Nazi crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A commitment to 'never again' cannot be reconciled with support for the AfD," Scholz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later stressed that "we are absolutely clear that the extreme right should stay outside the political decision-making process and that there would be no cooperation with them."

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday Ukraine would never accept any peace deal reached behind its back or without Kyiv's involvement – an implicit message to US President Donald Trump as he strives to end the war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech to the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky also called on Europe to create its own armed forces, urging the continent's leaders to decide their own future and saying Ukraine's armed forces alone were not enough for their security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky spoke after Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, the first between US and Russian leaders since Russia's February 2022 full-scale assault on Ukraine, and said he and Putin expected to meet in the future, probably in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has repeatedly said it wants to come together with the United States and Europe to devise a joint strategy before any Trump-Putin meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration so far has left the impression among some European allies that it was making concessions to Putin at Ukraine's expense before any negotiations begin, though remarks by some top US officials have raised confusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky predicted that the Kremlin would try to persuade Trump to attend Russia's May 9 commemorations in Moscow, when it marks the Soviet victory in World War Two with an annual military parade through Red Square.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky told the conference that he believed it would be "dangerous" if Trump met Putin before he and Trump meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  To Europe's leaders, he issued warnings, asking rhetorically whether their armies would be ready if Moscow launched an open or "false-flag" attack. The latter is designed to look like it was perpetrated by someone other than the group responsible for it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If this (Ukraine-Russia) war ends the wrong way, he (Putin) will have a surplus of battle-tested soldiers who know nothing but killing and looting," he said, citing intelligence reports saying Russia will dispatch its troops to Belarus this summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And now, as we fight this war and lay the groundwork for peace and security, we must build the Armed Forces of Europe." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged Nato to adopt a "rational and pragmatic" attitude and establish an "objective and correct understanding" of China, the foreign ministry said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the comment to Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte on Friday, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Beijing will continue to work with other parties to play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier at the conference, the top diplomat said China will work with like-minded countries to promote a stable and orderly multi-polar world as well as an inclusive and tolerant economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted that China maintains a consistent and stable policy toward the United States, which will continue to be guided by the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation. (Agencies)

    EU 'urgently' considering options to DRC fighting

<img alt="Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of Republic of Congo attends a meeting during the 38th Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU said on Saturday it was "urgently" considering all options in response to a widening rebel offensive in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, after Rwandan-backed forces seized a second major city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Having captured the key provincial capital of Goma last month, M23 fighters pushed south and took a vital airport before marching virtually unchecked into another key city, Bukavu, on Friday, according to security and humanitarian sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Alarmed by news of Rwandan backed M23 forces seizing Kavumu airport and entering Bukavu, ignoring international appeals for ceasefire," European Commission spokesman Anouar El Anouni wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EU urgently considers all the means at its disposal. The ongoing violation of the DRC's territorial integrity will not go unanswered."
  <br>
  <br>
  The warning comes as the conflict is set to dominate an African Union summit that opened on Saturday in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa with UN chief Antonio Guterres saying a regional escalation "must be avoided at all costs".
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows an appeal from the European Parliament, which this week urged the EU to suspend a minerals deal with Rwanda in response to Kigali's involvement in the offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers in Strasbourg on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a non-binding resolution which also called for the bloc's 27 member states to freeze all direct budget support as well as military and security assistance to Rwanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rwanda denies giving military support to the M23 but has accused extremist Hutu groups in DR Congo of threatening its security.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report by UN experts said last year Kigali maintained around 4,000 troops in DR Congo and had de facto control of the rebel group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conflict has killed thousands and driven vast numbers from their homes. (AFP)

    3 Israeli hostages released, 369 Palestinians freed

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli hostages Iair Horn, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Sasha (Alexander) Troufanov arrived at a release site in Gaza on Saturday after Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped avert a standoff that threatened to sink a fragile ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters led the three onto a stage at the site in Gaza's Khan Younis, live footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three have been returned in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, a swap which eases fears that the agreement could collapse before the end of a 42-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas had earlier threatened not to release more hostages after it accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire by blocking aid from entering Gaza, drawing counter-threats of a resumption of fighting from Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emaciated appearance of three hostages released last week and accounts of abuse by other hostages released since January 19 when the ceasefire took effect has set off Israeli protests demanding that the government stick to the ceasefire and proceed with the next stage of the deal to bring all the hostages home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prospects for the ceasefire surviving have also been clouded by U.S. President Donald Trump's call for Palestinians to be moved permanently out of Gaza, and for the enclave to be turned over to the United States to be redeveloped. That call was strongly rejected by Palestinian groups, Arab states and Western allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce was intended to open the way for a second phase of negotiations to return remaining hostages and complete the withdrawal of Israeli forces before a final end to the war and the rebuilding of Gaza, which now lies largely in ruins, facing shortages of food, running water and electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas threat to hold off from releasing more hostages followed its accusation that Israel had blocked tents and temporary shelter materials from entering into Gaza, leaving tens of thousands exposed to the winter cold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel rejected the accusation, saying it had allowed thousands of aid trucks in. Hamas on Saturday said it expects Israel to meet its aid obligations for the ceasefire to stay on track. (Reuters)

    OpenAI board rejects Elon Musk-led buyout offer

<img alt="OpenAI's board said it has unanimously rejected an Elon Musk-led offer to purchase the company. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791762_1_20250215151723.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI's board chairman on Friday said it has unanimously rejected an Elon Musk-led offer to buy the hot artificial intelligence company for US$97.4 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  "OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition," chairman of the board Bret Taylor said in a statement posted by the company on Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI (artificial general intelligence) benefits all of humanity," the statement continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk filed court documents on Wednesday saying that he would withdraw the offer to buy OpenAI if its board returns the artificial intelligence pioneer to a non-profit "charity" model.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI currently operates a hybrid structure, as a non-profit with a money-making subsidiary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The change to a for-profit model, one that Altman considers crucial for the company's development, had exacerbated ongoing tensions with Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and Altman were among the 11-person team that founded OpenAI in 2015, with the former providing initial funding of US$45 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three years later, Musk departed the company, with OpenAI citing "a potential future conflict for Elon... as Tesla continues to become more focused on AI."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk established his own artificial intelligence company called xAI early in 2023 after OpenAI ignited global fervor over the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The massive costs of designing, training, and deploying AI models have compelled OpenAI to seek a new corporate structure that would give investors equity and provide more stable governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transition to a traditional for-profit company requires approval from California and Delaware authorities, who will scrutinize how the non-profit arm of OpenAI is valued when it becomes a shareholder in the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current investors prefer a lower valuation to maximize their share of the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics say Musk's bid, valuing the OpenAI non-profit at US$97.4 billion - approximately US$30 billion above the level in current negotiations, according to The Information - appears designed to disrupt the company's fundraising efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI's Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane has said Musk's offer came from a competitor "who has struggled to keep up with the technology and compete with us in the marketplace". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas fighters are will release three Israeli hostages on Saturday in exchange for 369 Palestinians in Israeli custody, the sixth swap of a truce that came close to collapse this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of violating the January 19 ceasefire, with the Palestinian group saying it would pause releases and Israel threatening the resumption of war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Friday both sides signalled that the hostage release scheduled for Saturday would go ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group said that Israel was to release 369 inmates in exchange, with 24 of them expected to be deported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority, 333 people, are "prisoners from the Gaza Strip who were arrested after October 7", the group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the crisis that appeared to bring the fragile truce to a breaking point, Hamas said on Friday it expected talks on a second phase of the ceasefire to begin early next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose country is Israel's top backer and has been involved in mediation efforts during the war, is due to arrive in Israel late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week's release sparked anger in Israel and beyond, with the emaciated state of the freed Israeli hostages sparking concern over conditions in captivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also fears for Palestinians in Israeli custody after some prisoners required medical treatment on their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire has been under massive strain since US President Donald Trump proposed a takeover of the Gaza Strip under which the territory's population of more than two million would be moved to Egypt or Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any forced displacement evokes memories of the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of their ancestors during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab countries have come together to reject the plan, and Saudi Arabia will host the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday for a summit on the issue. (AFP)

    Trump signals auto tariffs to come in April

<img alt="Donald Trump made tariffs a central plank of presidential campaign last year. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791730_1_20250215093857.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Trump said on Friday that he planned to unveil tariffs on imported cars around April 2, adding to a cascade of levies he has threatened since taking office.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's statement did not specify whether the tariffs would apply to all auto imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since his inauguration on January 20, Trump has taken aim at allies and adversaries alike with threats of fresh duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has referred to tariffs as a way to raise revenue, remedy trade imbalances and pressure countries to act on US concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have warned that the tariffs will be passed on to American consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked when he might unveil auto tariffs, Trump said, "Maybe around April 2."
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not provide further details on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of the cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada and the other half from other major auto-producing countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latter group is led by Japan, South Korea and Germany, with Britain, Italy and Sweden a source of a smaller volume of imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent days, Ford CEO Jim Farley has blasted a proposed Trump tariff of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada, noting that it disadvantages US companies that have integrated their supply chains across North America under trade agreements, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) negotiated in the first Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  On February 3, the White House suspended the tariffs for 30 days following moves from Canada and Mexico on border security and fentanyl policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Levies targeting the auto sector would come after the president recently firmed up plans for tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports beginning March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has previously promised tariffs on semiconductors, steel, oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, in a move broadening trade conflicts, Trump launched plans for "reciprocal tariffs" that could hit all US trading partners on a country-by-country basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, has called for Trump to drop proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We support President Trump's efforts to consider the entire global trade situation, including both tariff and non-tariff barriers," said AAPC President Matt Blunt on Thursday in response to the announcement on reciprocal tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the meantime, Ford, GM, and Stellantis continue to believe that vehicles and auto parts that meet the USMCA requirements should not be subject to additional tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AAPC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. (AFP)

 US Vice President JD Vance pledged on Friday that Washington sought to secure a "lasting" peace as he held a first meeting with Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss Donald Trump's push for a deal with Moscow.
 <br>
  <br>
  The talks in Munich were seen as a key moment for Kyiv as it tried to keep Washington on its side after Trump stunned allies by announcing peace efforts with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to achieve a durable, lasting peace, not the kind of peace that's going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple of years down the road," Vance said as the meeting wrapped up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said "good conversations" had been had with Zelensky about how they could reach that goal, and they would have more talks "in the days, weeks, and months to come.".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky also hailed a "good conversation," saying the encounter with Vance was "our first meeting, not last, I'm sure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to move as quickly as possible towards a real and guaranteed peace," Zelensky wrote later on X, adding that an envoy from Washington would visit Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump rattled Ukraine and its European allies on Wednesday by agreeing to launch peace talks in his first publicly announced call with Putin since returning to office.
  <br>
  <br>
  After nearly three years of war of frosty relations, the dramatic thaw in US-Russia relations sparked fears that Ukraine could be left behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials have insisted that Zelensky will be involved in negotiations—and the Ukrainian leader said he would be prepared to sit down with Putin after agreeing to a "common plan" with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only in this case I'm ready to meet," Zelensky told the Munich Security Conference before seeing Vance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance said ahead of the meeting that the United States was prepared to pressure Russia, adding that Europe should "of course" be at the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also told Europe to "step up" on bolstering its own defence to allow Washington to focus on threats elsewhere in the world. (AFP)

    Drone damages outer shell of Chernobyl nuclear plant

<img alt="Ukraine said that a Russian drone had struck a cover built to contain radiation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791695_1_20250214213154.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A drone armed with a warhead hit the outer protective shell of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant on Friday, damaging the structure and briefly starting a fire, in an attack Kyiv blamed on Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin denied it was responsible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Radiation levels at the shuttered plant in the Kyiv region — site of the world's worst nuclear accident — have not increased, according to the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, which said the strike did not breach the plant's inner containment shell.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IAEA did not attribute blame, saying only that its team stationed at the site heard an explosion and was informed that a drone had struck the shell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting around nuclear power plants has repeatedly raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe during three years of war, particularly in a country where many vividly remember living through the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which killed at least 30 people and spewed radioactive fallout over much of the Northern Hemisphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is Europe’s biggest, has occasionally been hit by drones during the war without causing significant damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike came two days after US President Donald Trump upended American policy on Ukraine, saying he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move seemed to identify Putin as the only player that matters and looked set to sideline Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as European governments, in any peace talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said a Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead hit the plant's outer shell and started a fire, which had been put out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shell was built in 2016 over another heavy concrete containment structure, which was placed on the plant’s fourth reactor soon after the 1986 disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both shells seek to prevent radiation leaks. (AP)

    Japan to release emergency rice reserves

<img alt="A five-kilo bag was selling for 3,688 yen (US$24) in the last week of January, according to a government survey, up from 2,023 yen last year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Japanese government on Friday said it would release a fifth of its emergency rice stockpile after hot weather, poor harvests and panic buying over a "megaquake" warning nearly doubled prices over a year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan has previously tapped into its reserves to cope with disasters, but this marked the first time since the stockpile was built in 1995 that it was doing so because of supply chain problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some supermarket shelves were emptied in August of rice following a week-long holiday, a series of typhoons and warnings of a looming major earthquake that has so far failed to materialise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had initially hoped prices would stabilise late last year once newly harvested rice arrived in stores, but inflation continued unabated, this time because some distributors were hoarding for fear of running out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Agriculture Minister Taku Eto told reporters on Friday the government would release 210,000 tonnes of rice from its stock of one million tonnes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope you will take this as our strong determination to improve at all costs the situation where distribution has been delayed and stuck," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice prices had already began to change consumption patterns for some like Tokyo resident Eriko Kato.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still do buy rice occasionally, but since it's so expensive I sometimes give up on buying it once I see the price," Kato, 41, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A five-kilogramme bag was retailing at 3,688 yen (US$24) in the last week of January, according to a government survey, up from 2,023 yen last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice consumption in Japan has more than halved in the past 60 years to about 50.9 kilos in 2022, but the grain remains deeply ingrained in Japanese culture and its harvesting has shaped the nation's landscape -- even being used in Shinto rituals. (AFP)

    Vance to clarify Trump Ukraine peace plan in Munich

<img alt="US Vice President JD Vance will meet Ukraine's president in Munich where the pair will discuss Washington's efforts to end the conflict between Kyiv and Moscow. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791648_1_20250214165245.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance will lead America's delegation to the Munich Security Conference that starts on Friday in the southern German city, where world leaders and diplomats are gathering amid intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration's foreign policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The future of Ukraine will be the top item on the agenda following a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, when they pledged to work together to end the three-year-old Russia-Ukraine conflict .
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday for talks that many — particularly in Europe — hope will shed at least some light on Trump’s ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was supposed to join them but was delayed when his Air Force plane had to return to Washington after developing a mechanical problem en route to Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Department said he would take a different aircraft, but it was unclear whether he would arrive in time for the meeting with Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who upended years of steadfast US support for Ukraine during his call with Putin on Wednesday, has been vague about his specific intentions — other than suggesting that a deal will likely result in Ukraine being forced to cede territory that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Ukraine war has to end,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “Young people are being killed at levels that nobody’s seen since World War II. And it’s a ridiculous war.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russia-Ukraine war is the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi will also be in Munich to communicate Beijing's position on global security.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Ukraine, state media cited Wang as saying China welcomes all efforts committed to peace talks and supports building a "balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people were killed and more than two dozen were injured when a blaze ripped through a hotel construction site in the South Korean port city of Busan on Friday, the National Fire Agency said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire started just before 11am local time at the construction site of the Banyan Tree Hotel, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 workers were present when the blaze erupted, a National Fire Agency official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-five people were injured, a public health department official said, adding that most were minor injuries caused by smoke inhalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fire had already reached its peak by the time we arrived and thick black smoke was covering the scene," Busan Gijang Fire Station chief Hong Mun-sik told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were many flammable materials blocking the entrance," Hong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out on the first floor of the building where workers had stored insulation materials, Hong said, and the fatalities occurred where the fire started.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The exact cause and location of the fire need to be thoroughly investigated," Hong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire was brought under control around 1.30pm. (AFP)

    Trump signs plan for reciprocal tariffs on US partners

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump inked plans on Thursday for sweeping "reciprocal tariffs" that could hit both allies and competitors, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said he had decided to impose reciprocal duties, telling reporters that US allies were often "worse than our enemies" on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’ve decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff," Trump said at the proclamation signing. “It’s fair to all. No other country can complain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, he called the European Union "absolutely brutal" in trade ties with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the memo Trump signed on Thursday, officials - including the US trade representative and commerce secretary - will propose remedies on a country-by-country basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick said that studies should be completed by April 1, and the president could start tariffs as early as April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the EU, the White House also flagged differences in certain US tariff levels with India and Brazil, while noting Japan's "high structural barriers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists caution that sweeping tariffs on US imports would likely boost inflation, not reduce it, in the near term and could weigh on growth eventually.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump acknowledged on Thursday that US prices "could go up" due to tariffs, but he expressed confidence that they would ultimately ease. (Agencies)

    Modi, Trump agree to trade talks

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump greeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House with a bear hug on Thursday and called him “a great friend of mine," but nonetheless warned that India won't be spared from higher tariffs he's begun imposing on US trade partners around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who had previously derided India as the “tariff king,” called the import levies imposed by Modi's country “very unfair and strong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Whatever India charges, we charge them,” Trump said at a joint news conference where he stood next to Modi. “So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge.”
  <br>
  <br>
  As he has while recently hosting other foreign leaders, Trump talked about ensuring that the US erases its trade deficit with India. He suggested that could be done by increasing US energy exports to India but also promised to restore “fairness and reciprocity” to the economic relationship and said he and Modi had begun working on a major trade deal that could be completed later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and India have a trade deficit of US$50 billion in India’s favour. Goods and services trade between the two countries totalled around US$190.1 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to India’s External Affairs Ministry, US exports to India were worth nearly US$70 billion, and imports US$120 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi, the fourth world leader to visit the White House since Trump's return, described him as a friend and told him he was adopting a take on his "Make America Great Again" slogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining Trump's meeting with Modi was SpaceX and Tesla tycoon Elon Musk. Modi also met one-on-one with Musk, raising questions over whether the world's richest man was meeting the Indian leader in an official or business capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indian premier posted pictures of himself shaking hands with the beaming Musk, with several children on Musk's side of the room, and Indian officials on the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi, a prolific user of Musk-owned social media platform X, said later that he had known Musk before he became prime minister. (Agencies)

 US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he wants to restart nuclear arms control talks with Russia and China and that eventually he hopes all three countries could agree to cut their massive defence budgets in half.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump lamented the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in rebuilding the nation's nuclear deterrent and said he hoped to gain commitments from Russia and China to cut their own spending.

  “There’s no reason for us to be building brand new nuclear weapons, we already have so many,” Trump said. “You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully much more productive," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said if the weapons were ever called to use, “that’s going to be probably oblivion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two countries once “we straighten it all out" in the Middle East and Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia. And I want to say, ‘let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I think we’ll be able to.” (Agencies)

    Vaccine critic RFK Jr sworn in as US health secretary

<div class="itemFullText">
 Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine critic who has pledged to tackle chronic disease, was named US Health Secretary on Thursday after overcoming resistance from the medical establishment and members of Congress with promises to limit his role in vaccination policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  As Kennedy was sworn into the post, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to "Make America Healthy Again," that would investigate chronic illness and deliver an action plan to fight childhood diseases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy said on Thursday his first priorities would be around "radical transparency" and removing those in the government who had conflicts of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 20 years, I've gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I could end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country. On August 23 of last year, God sent me President Trump," Kennedy said, referring to when he dropped his independent presidential bid and endorsed the Republican candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Senate earlier on Thursday voted to confirm Kennedy 52-48, with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the lone Republican joining all 47 Democrats to vote against Kennedy, who had made pledges to protect existing vaccination programmes in a bid to secure votes of hesitant lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy will now oversee multiple high-profile agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy, 71, is an environmental lawyer who has long sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevented millions of deaths for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will now run the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that directs more than US$3 trillion in healthcare spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also under HHS purview are the Medicare and Medicaid programmes that provide health insurance for over 140 million Americans and the National Institutes of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to pledging to work to end chronic disease, Kennedy has said he wants to break any ties between employees at the US drugs regulator and industry. (Reuters)

    Foreign Minister Wang Yi in UK for talks

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Britain need to strengthen strategic communication, enhance mutual trust and demonstrate responsibility as major countries, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a meeting with the UK prime minister on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang is visiting London for a strategic dialogue with the British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, at which both sides agreed to speed up preparations for institutional dialogues on the economy and trade, health and industrial cooperation, the Foreign Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lammy hosted talks with Wang as the pair revived the China-UK Strategic Dialogue, a bilateral forum that was last held in 2018 before it stalled as relations soured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer "dropped in" to a meeting between Wang and UK National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell, a Downing Street spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer "underlined his intention to build a consistent and respectful relationship between the UK and China" and "reiterated that the UK will always engage frankly on the areas where our views differ," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides exchanged in-depth views on the Ukraine crisis, with Wang stressing "no expansion of the battlefields, no escalation of hostilities, and no fanning flames."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said China welcomed efforts committed to peace talks and supported the building of a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour government, elected in July, has sought to improve the UK's relationship with Beijing after the two countries fell out during the latter years of Conservative rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major thawing of tensions, Starmer and President Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit last November - the first bilateral meeting between leaders of the two countries since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance minister Rachel Reeves then visited China last month seeking investment to kickstart growth in Britain's economy, while Lammy visited Beijing in October. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge humpback whale briefly scooped a kayaker in its mouth in the seas off the coast of southern Chile before spitting him out unscathed in a dramatic incident caught on camera.
 <br>
  <br>
  The kayaker, Adrian Simancas, was out with his father last weekend in the seas off the town of Punta Arenas, when the whale surfaced and scooped him up in his mouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt like I was being lifted, but it was clearly too strong to be a wave," said Simancas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I turned, I felt something blue and white passing close to my face, like on one side and above. I didn't understand what was happening. Then everything... I went under and thought I had been swallowed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Luckily, the whale quickly spat out Simancas unharmed. His father, in another kayak, caught the whole thing on camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I turned on the camera and heard a wave crash behind me, loudly. When I turned, I didn't see anything," said his father, Dell Simancas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that was the only moment of real fear because I didn't see Adrian for about three seconds. Then he suddenly shot out without the packraft, and a second later, the packraft emerged, and then I saw the fin of something."
  <br>
  <br>
  Adrian Simancas was sure he was going to die during the ordeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought I was done for, that I was dead. It was like three strange seconds down there," he said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 German authorities said a driver drove a car into a labour union demonstration in central Munich on Thursday, injuring at least 28 people including children.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said it was believed to be an attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, an Afghan asylum-seeker, was arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident follows a series of attacks involving immigrants in recent months that have pushed migration to the forefront of the campaign for Germany’s February 23 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said on social media platform X that the driver was “secured” and no longer posed any danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  A damaged Mini could be seen at the scene, along with debris including shoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter said he was “deeply shocked” by the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said participants in a demonstration by the service workers’ union ver.di were walking along a street at about 10.30am when the car overtook a police vehicle following the gathering, accelerated and plowed into the back of the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers arrested the suspect after firing a shot at the car, deputy police chief Christian Huber said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bavarian capital will see heavy security in the coming days because of the three-day Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of international foreign and security policy officials, which opens on Friday. (AP)

    'Europe must be involved in Ukraine peace talks'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Several Nato allies stressed on Thursday that Ukraine and Europe must not be cut out of any peace negotiations, after US President Donald Trump signalled that he would hold talks soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
 <br>
  <br>
  “Let’s not forget, Russia remains a threat well beyond Ukraine,” British Defence Secretary John Healey said after the United States rattled Nato by saying that Ukraine should never join the alliance and that European allies should take responsibility for Ukraine's security going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine. And Ukraine’s voice must be at the heart of any talks,” Healey told reporters at Nato's headquarters, as the organisation’s 32 defence ministers met for talks on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swedish Defence Minister Pål Jonson said European nations provided about 60 percent of the military support to Ukraine last year and must be involved, especially given US demands that Europe take more responsibility for Ukraine's security in the longer term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s very natural that we’re engaged into the discussions,” Jonson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Estonian counterpart, Hanno Pevkur, underlined that the European Union has driven sanctions against Russia, has invested heavily in Ukraine’s defence, and will be asked to foot the bill for rebuilding the war-ravaged country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to be there. So there is no question about it. Otherwise this peace will not be long lasting,” Pevkur warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Ukraine’s Western backers on Wednesday that Nato membership for Ukraine was unrealistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia and instead prepare for a negotiated peace settlement to be backed up by international troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  After talks with Putin and then Zelenskyy, Trump said on Wednesday he would “probably” meet in person with the Russian leader soon, and suggested that the meeting could happen in Saudi Arabia. (AP)

    North Korea demolishing family reunion centre: Seoul

<img alt="South Koreans had met with their North Korean relatives during separated family reunions at the Mount Kumgang resort. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791443_1_20250213113318.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea is demolishing a venue that for decades hosted tearful reunions of families separated by the Korean War and the division of the country, Seoul said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reunions in the North's Kumgang mountain, last held in 2018, were a testament to the devastating human cost of the Korean peninsula's division.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the meetings were subject to the vagaries of inter-Korea politics and often used as a negotiating tool by Pyongyang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The demolition of the Mount Kumgang Reunion Center is an inhumane act that tramples on the earnest wishes of separated families," a spokesperson for Seoul's unification ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea "sternly urges an immediate halt to such actions" and "expresses strong regret".
  <br>
  <br>
  "North Korea's unilateral demolition cannot be justified under any pretext, and the North Korean authorities must bear full responsibility for this situation," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 1988, around 130,000 South Koreans have registered their "separated families".
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 2025, around 36,000 of those individuals are still alive, according to official data. Seventy-five percent say they do not know if their relatives are alive or dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some were lucky enough to be chosen to take part in occasional crossborder reunions, mostly hosted at the Mount Kumgang resort.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea has been escalating its rhetoric against its southern neighbour in recent years, designating the south as a "hostile state".
  <br>
  <br>
  Pyongyang also blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border last year, which prompted South Korea's military to fire warning shots at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, Pyongyang scrapped a 2018 military accord designed to curb the risk of inadvertent clashes between two countries that remain technically at war, prompting the South to take a similar step. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on Wednesday, and Trump ordered top US officials to begin talks on ending the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The conversations came after Trump's defence secretary earlier said Kyiv would have to give up its long-held goals of joining the Nato military alliance and regaining all of its territory seized by Russia, signalling a dramatic shift in Washington's approach to the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He wants it to end. He doesn't want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after speaking with Putin for more than an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we're on the way to getting peace. I think President Putin wants peace, President Zelenskiy wants peace and I want peace. I just want to see people stop getting killed," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long said he would quickly end the war in Ukraine, without spelling out exactly how he would accomplish this.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin earlier said Putin and Trump had agreed to meet, and Putin had invited Trump to visit Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said their first meeting would "probably" take place soon in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on his social media platform, he said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would lead negotiations on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Zelenskiy spoke after Trump's call with Putin, and Zelenskiy's office said the conversation lasted for about an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a meaningful conversation with @POTUS. We... talked about opportunities to achieve peace, discussed our readiness to work together ...and Ukraine's technological capabilities... including drones and other advanced industries," Zelenskiy wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  No Ukraine peace talks have been held since the early months of the conflict, now approaching its third anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  European powers, including Britain, France and Germany, said on Wednesday they had to be part of any future negotiations on the fate of Ukraine, underscoring that only a fair accord with security guarantees would ensure lasting peace. They said they were ready to enhance support for Ukraine and put it in a position of strength. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's ousted President Yoon Seok Yeol faces potentially his last impeachment hearing on Thursday over his failed martial law bid before judges begin deliberations on whether to formally remove him from office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former prosecutor has remained defiant through weeks of hearings at Seoul's Constitutional Court, blaming a "malicious" opposition for his December bid to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attempt only lasted six hours as the opposition-led parliament voted the declaration down, later impeaching him over his attempt to impose martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was detained last month on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ousted president arrived at the court at around 9am local time (0000 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's hearing is set to hear evidence from the former chief of South Korea's intelligence service and one of the heads of Seoul's Capital Defence Command, the military unit dispatched to the parliament during the short-lived martial law bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is widely expected – but not officially confirmed – to be Yoon's last hearing before the court's judges go behind closed doors to deliberate whether to uphold his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  That process could take over a week to a fortnight – formerly impeached Presidents Park Geun-hye and Roh Moo-hyun had to wait 11 and 14 days, respectively, to learn their fates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many legal scholars and experts agree that a unanimous ruling in favour of impeachment will be made by the Constitutional Court judges," said Kim Hyun-jung, a researcher at the Korea University Institute of Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But experts also warn that political wrangling could hold up the trial – prominent conservative supporters of Yoon have called for more hearings to be held.
  <br>
  <br>
  An additional judge could also be approved to the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench, which is currently one member short.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the court upholds the impeachment, an election must be held within 60 days to choose a new president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Yoon's impeachment trial has centred on the question of whether he violated the constitution by declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suggested last week that even if he had ordered the arrest of MPs to prevent them from voting down his decree, it would not legally matter because it had not been carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also facing a criminal trial on insurrection charges, for which he faces a prison sentence or the death penalty. (AFP)

    Elon Musk's X settles Trump lawsuit over ban: report

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's social media platform X has agreed to settle a lawsuit over what was then Twitter banning Donald Trump after the mob attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, a newspaper said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  X has agreed to pay about US$10 million to settle a lawsuit that Trump filed against Twitter and its former chief executive Jack Dorsey protesting his ban, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the now infamous insurrection, more than 140 police officers were injured in hours of clashes with pro-Trump rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twitter and other social media platforms removed Trump at the time due to concerns he would promote further violence with bogus claims that voter fraud caused his loss to Joe Biden in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  Billionaire Musk subsequently bought Twitter and renamed it X. Musk reinstated Trump on the platform and was a major Trump supporter during the recent presidential race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has made Musk head of a newly created Department of Government Efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta in January agreed to pay Trump US$25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit he filed claiming he was wrongfully censored by Facebook and Instagram after the US Capitol riot, according to the social media giant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta in the settlement will not admit wrongdoing over the suspensions of Trump's accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Meta confirmed the settlement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had widely criticised social media platforms for suspending his accounts after the January 6, 2021 insurrection and for comments he made that were seen as praising people engaged in the violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  After taking office in January, Trump granted pardons to more than 1,500 of his supporters who stormed the Capitol in a bid to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also ordered that all pending criminal cases against Capitol riot defendants be dropped. (AFP)

    Pentagon chief lays out red lines on Ukraine at Nato

<div class="itemFullText">
 New US defence chief Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday Washington would not deploy troops to Ukraine under any peace deal with Russia, and that Kyiv regaining all its land or joining Nato were not realistic goals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing a meeting of Kyiv's backers in Brussels, Hegseth laid out President Donald Trump's red lines and demands -- and told Europe to ramp up both support for Ukraine and spending on its own defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be US troops deployed to Ukraine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US defence chief said any peace process "must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective" -- although Washington, like Europe, wanted "a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine".
  <br>
  <br>
  And he warned that "the United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement".
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's allies have been waiting nervously for clarity from Trump's administration after the US president demanded that the transatlantic alliance more than double its defence spending target and vowed to end the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's two days of talks in Brussels are part of a flurry of visits to Europe by top US officials, culminating with Vice President JD Vance meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a security conference in Munich on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On both support for Kyiv and Europe's own defence spending, the Pentagon chief delivered the resounding message that Washington expects its allies to do more.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Safeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of Nato," Hegseth said. "Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth further warned that Washington would not accept what it considers "imbalanced" burden-sharing within the alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States remains committed to the Nato alliance and to the defence partnership with Europe, full stop," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will not travel to Washington for talks at the White House as long as the agenda includes US President Donald Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza, two Egyptian security sources said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has infuriated the Arab world with a plan to permanently displace the population of more than 2 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, claim US control of it and turn it into the "Riviera of the Middle East".
  <br>
  <br>
  He has demanded Egypt and Jordan take in the Palestinians, and has threatened to withdraw aid from the two US-allied Arab states if they refuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt has said Trump had extended an open invitation to Sisi to visit the White House earlier this month. A US official said no date for such a visit has been set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian presidency and foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan's King Abdullah appeared uncomfortable during a meeting with Trump at the White House on Tuesday, at which Trump discussed his Gaza plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty visited Washington this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian sources said one aim of his trip was to avert a potentially awkward presidential visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Egyptian sources, it was made apparent to Abdelatty during a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the displacement plan would be on the table if Sisi visited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdelatty responded that such a meeting would be of no use, and that any discussion should be over Egypt's own plan for reconstruction of Gaza, the sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt has said its plan would "ensure Palestinians remain on their land". (Reuters)

    US detainee returns home after release by Russia

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said that another detainee would be freed on Wednesday, as he met Marc Fogel, who was released after being held in Russia since 2021.
 <br>
  <br>
  Describing the prisoner deal with Russia as "very fair, very reasonable," Trump said "somebody else is being released tomorrow" without providing details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schoolteacher Fogel, freed by Russia after three and a half years in prison, got a flag-waving welcome from Trump after a flight home from Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like the luckiest man on earth right now," said Fogel, an American flag draped around his shoulders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a middle-class school teacher who’s now in a dream world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, standing alongside Fogel in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, said: "To me he looks damned good."
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of 63-year-old Fogel, who had been detained in Russia since August 2021 and was serving a 14-year sentence, came as Trump seeks to improve relations with Moscow as part of an effort to secure an end to the Ukraine conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Fogel both thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just wanted to get him back home," Trump said, and said he would take Fogel on a tour of the Lincoln Bedroom upstairs in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fogel was released into the custody of Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who made an unannounced stop in Moscow on Tuesday to pick him up.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a plane home, Fogel, who is from Pennsylvania, was shown with a raised glass, a cheese plate and his US passport in a photo posted on social media by Trump's chief hostage envoy Adam Boehler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what the United States gave up in exchange for Fogel, Trump told reporters earlier: "Not much" and called the release a show of good faith from the Russians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were treated very nicely by Russia. Actually, I hope that's the beginning of a relationship where we can end that [Ukraine] war and millions of people can stop being killed," Trump said. (Reuters)

    White House bars AP over its 'Gulf of America' style

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House Correspondents' Association protested a decision by the White House on Tuesday to bar an Associated Press (AP) reporter from an event with US President Donald Trump over the news agency's decision to continue referring to the Gulf of Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed an executive order in January directing the Interior Secretary to change the name to the Gulf of America.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The White House cannot dictate how news organisations report the news, nor should it penalise working journalists because it is unhappy with their editors' decisions," Eugene Daniels, president of the association, said on Tuesday in a statement posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the administration to bar a reporter from the Associated Press from an official event open to news coverage today is unacceptable," Daniels said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AP Executive Editor Julie Pace said in a statement earlier that its reporter had been blocked from attending an Oval Office event after being informed by the White House it would be barred unless it aligned its editorial standards with Trump's order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism," Pace said, adding that limiting access violated the First Amendment of the US Constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP says in its stylebook that the Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years and, as a global news agency, the AP will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most news organisations, including Reuters, call it the Gulf of Mexico although, where relevant, Reuters style is to include the context about Trump's executive order. (Reuters)

    Trump presses Jordan's king to take in Palestinians

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump on Tuesday pressed Jordan's King Abdullah to take in Palestinians who would be permanently displaced under the president's plan for the US to take over the Gaza Strip, even as the king said his country was firmly opposed to the move.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking alongside the Arab country's ruler in the White House, Trump implied he would not budge on his idea that involves moving the Gaza Strip's residents and transforming the war-ravaged territory into what he billed a "Riviera of the Middle East."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has infuriated the Arab world by saying that Palestinians would not be able to return to their homes under his proposal to redevelop the enclave, which has been devastated by an Israeli offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to take it. We're going to hold it, we're going to cherish it. We're going to get it going eventually, where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East," Trump said in the Oval Office, saying his plan would "bring peace" to the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  King Abdullah said later that he reiterated to Trump Jordan’s "steadfast position" against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, as well as in the occupied West Bank that borders his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the unified Arab position," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the views of his Jordanian counterpart, Trump said Jordan, as well as Egypt, would ultimately agree to house displaced residents of Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries rely on Washington for economic and military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Jordan. I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt," said Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We may have some place else, but I think when we finish our talks, we'll have a place where they're going to live very happily and very safely." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and around 60 other countries on Tuesday signed the final statement of a French-hosted artificial intelligence summit that said AI should be inclusive, open, ethical and safe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States and Britain did not sign the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The signatories agreed that the two-day summit laid out an open, multi-stakeholder and inclusive approach that will enable AI to be human rights-based, human-centric, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing told the summit that China was willing to work with other countries to safeguard security and share achievements in the field of artificial intelligence to build "a community with a shared future for mankind".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said AI has become an important driving force for the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and Beijing has always participated in global cooperation and governance on AI with a highly responsible attitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Vice President JD Vance said "massive regulations" by the European Union on AI could strangle the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry," Vance told the summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  A source close to organisers said they were not surprised that the US had not signed, considering their stance on regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UK government spokesperson said the final statement did not sufficiently address "harder questions around national security".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We felt the declaration didn't provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it," the spokesperson said. (Agencies)

    Altman dismisses Musk's OpenAI takeover bid

<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a US$97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are not for sale,” Altman said on Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk’s bid, announced on Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a non-profit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created as a counterweight to Google's dominance in artificial intelligence, OpenAI got its initial funding from Musk, who invested US$45 million. Three years later, Musk departed OpenAI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Subsequent lawsuits revealed that OpenAI claimed Musk left after his attempts to become CEO or to merge the company with Tesla were rejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  After November 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT and created a global technology sensation, Musk began criticising the company, trolling it on social media for keeping its source code private and signing a widely publicised manifesto calling for a pause in AI development, even as he pursued his own AI projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August 2024, Musk refiled a lawsuit against OpenAI and its backer Microsoft, claiming the ChatGPT maker had betrayed its founding mission of benefiting the public good in favour of pursuing profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk later updated the lawsuit to prevent OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit company - a change Altman considers crucial for the company's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's San Francisco correspondent, Mark Niu, said Musk's bid appeared designed to disrupt the company's fundraising efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The latest reports are that the OpenAI board hasn't even seen that proposal. So it's hard to know what's going on. But there is a real feeling that among investors that Musk is really trying to... tie up things in the courts," said Niu. (AP, additional reporting RTHK)

    Israel threatens renewed 'intense' Gaza war

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared on Tuesday the ceasefire in Gaza would end and the military would resume fighting Hamas until it was defeated if the Palestinian militant group did not release hostages by midday on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Following Netanyahu's ultimatum, Hamas issued a statement renewing its commitment to the ceasefire and accusing Israel of jeopardising the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli announcement came after Netanyahu met with several key ministers, including defence, foreign affairs and national security, who he said gave the ultimatum their full support.
  <br>
  <br>
  After nearly 16 months of war, Hamas has gradually been releasing hostages since the first phase of a ceasefire began on January 19, but on Monday said it would not free any more until further notice over accusations Israel was violating the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon – the ceasefire will end and the IDF (military) will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear if Netanyahu meant Hamas should release all hostages held in Gaza or just the three who had been expected to be released on Saturday under the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, 16 of 33 hostages have been freed as part of the ceasefire deal's first phase that is due to last 42 days. Five Thai hostages were also let go in an unscheduled release.
  <br>
  <br>
  In exchange, Israel has released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including prisoners serving life sentences for deadly attacks and others detained during the war and held without charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are thought to be 76 hostages still held in Gaza, more than 35 of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli media. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's former football federation chief Luis Rubiales gives his highly-anticipated version of events on Tuesday in the trial over his forced kiss on Jenni Hermoso that sparked global outrage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case has riveted the country since opening on February 3 and has turned Hermoso into an icon of the fight against macho culture and sexism in sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales was forced to resign in disgrace in 2023 after kissing Hermoso on the lips following Spain's triumph at that year's Women's World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are seeking two-and-a-half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales, 47, has called the kiss a "peck between friends celebrating" and denied any coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to now he has attended hearings without intervening as a slew of witnesses testified at the National Court near Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hermoso told the opening day of the trial she felt "disrespected" after a non-consensual kiss that "should not happen in any social or work setting".
  <br>
  <br>
  Her teammates have described how she cried and felt "overwhelmed" following the incident, while her brother Rafael Hermoso has said she came under pressure to downplay the incident to save Rubiales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former women's team manager Jorge Vilda and two ex-federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque, are also due to take the stand on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales minimised the importance of the kiss on Hermoso at the time and defied calls for his resignation at an emergency federation meeting in August 2023, railing against "false feminism".
  <br>
  <br>
  He resigned in September that year after Fifa suspended him and Spanish prosecutors opened an investigation into alleged sexual assault. (AFP)

    Corruption charges dropped against New York mayor

<img alt="The US Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791145_1_20250211115242.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Justice Department on Monday ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, arguing in a departure from long-standing norms the case was interfering with the mayor’s ability to aid the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told prosecutors in New York they were “directed to dismiss” the bribery charges against Adams immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bove said the order was not based on the strength of evidence in the case, but rather because it had been brought too close to Adams re-election campaign and was distracting from the mayor’s efforts to assist in the Trump administration’s law-and-order priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime,” Bove wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo also ordered prosecutors in New York not to take “additional investigative steps” against the Democrat until after November's mayoral election, though it left open the possibility that charges could be refiled after that following a review.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intervention and reasoning — that a powerful defendant could be too occupied with official duties to face accountability for alleged crimes — marks a striking deviation from long-standing justice department norms.
  <br>
  <br>
  An attorney for Adams, Alex Spiro, said the justice department’s order had vindicated the mayor’s claim of innocence.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Now, thankfully, the mayor and New York can put this unfortunate and misguided prosecution behind them," said Spiro, who has also represented Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case against Adams was brought under the previous US attorney for the district, Damien Williams, who stepped down before Trump became president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo follows months of speculation that Trump would take steps to end the case against Adams, who was charged in September with accepting bribes of free or discounted travel and illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals seeking to buy his influence. (AP)

    Google complies with orders to rename 'Gulf of Mexico'

<img alt='Google Maps users in the United States will see the "Gulf Mexico" renamed as "Gulf of America" in compliance with White House executive orders.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Google on Monday changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to "Gulf of America" for those using its Maps platform inside the United States, complying with an executive order by President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tech giant wrote in a blog post that users outside the United States will continue to see both the original and new name for the Gulf of Mexico, as is the case for other disputed locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People using Maps in the US will see 'Gulf of America,' and people in Mexico will see 'Gulf of Mexico.' Everyone else will see both names," Google wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google said the change aligns with its policy of following official US government geographic designations through the Geographic Names Information System.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon taking office, Trump signed executive orders not only changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico but also reverting the name of Denali, America's highest peak, to its former moniker Mt. McKinley.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2015, then-president Barack Obama officially recognised the Alaska mountain as Denali, the name used by Alaska Natives for centuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's renamings sparked criticism from indigenous groups in Alaska, who have long advocated for maintaining the Denali name, and raised diplomatic concerns with Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has cheekily suggested calling the United States "Mexican America," pointing to a map from before one-third of her country was seized by the United States in 1848. (AFP)

    Trump declares paper straws 'don't work'

<img alt='US President Donald Trump said that paper straws favoured by environmentalists "explode" in a "matter of minutes". Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791118_1_20250211093009.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump is moving to reverse a federal push away from plastic straws, declaring that paper straws don't last very long.
 <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,” Trump said on Monday as he signed an executive order to review federal purchasing policies that restrict plastic straws.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move by Trump - whose 2019 re-election campaign sold Trump-branded re-usable plastic straws - targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump declared President Joe Biden’s policy “DEAD!” in a social media post over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said he thinks "it's okay” to continue using them.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think that plastic is going to affect the sharks very much as they’re... munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also complained that paper straws "don't work".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode. If something's hot, they don't last very long, like a matter of minutes, sometimes a matter of seconds." Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Straws are just the beginning,” Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. "Back to Plastic is a movement we should all get behind.”
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.
  <br>
  <br>
  Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tonnes of new plastic. About 40 per cent of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea last year but didn’t reach an agreement. (Agencies)

    US slaps 25 percent tariffs on steel, aluminum

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump substantially raised tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Monday to a flat 25 percent "without exceptions or exemptions", although he agreed to consider an exemption on Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a telephone call with Australia’s prime minister on Tuesday that took place before the tariff rise, Trump said the US trade surplus with Australia was one of the reasons he was considering an exemption.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We actually have a surplus," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about trade with Australia. “It’s one of the only countries which we do. And I told (Albanese) that that’s something that we’ll give great consideration to.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia had an exemption from such tariffs during Trump’s first administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed proclamations raising the US tariff rate on aluminium to 25 percent from his previous 10 percent rate and eliminating country exceptions and quota deals as well as hundreds of thousands of product-specific tariff exclusions for both metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminium to be "smelted and cast" within the region to curb US imports of minimally-processed metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he signed the order at the White House, Trump said he would follow Monday's action with announcements about reciprocal tariffs on all countries that impose duties on US goods over the next two days, and said he was also looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about threats of retaliation by other countries against his new tariffs, Trump said: "I don't mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's tariffs almost immediately drew criticism from Canada, the largest source of steel imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, called Trump a destabilising force in the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the proclamations, shares in US steel and aluminium makers jumped, while shares in European and Asian steelmakers fell. The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and industry data. (Agencies)

    Trump pauses work at US consumer protection agency

<img alt="Elon Musk (right) and Republicans have long accused the independent agency of overreach. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791097_1_20250211035951.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration has informed staff at the country's consumer protection agency that it is temporarily shuttering its headquarters and pausing all work, according to an email shared on Monday with AFP.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was set up in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis and is tasked with protecting American consumers from corporate misconduct.
  <br>
  <br>
  It serves as a watchdog over a variety of consumer issues ranging from mortgages to credit cards to debt collection, and has long been a target of Republican lawmakers and industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the message to staff, acting CFPB director Russell Vought said the agency's Washington office would be closed this week, and told employees not to show up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Please do not perform any work tasks," said Vought, Trump's new director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and a key architect of the conservative plan known as Project 2025 to reform the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vought added that staff would need to seek written permission from him before doing any urgent work going forward, and should otherwise "stand down from performing any work task."
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans have long accused the independent agency of overreach, with some of Trump's most ardent supporters, including the tech billionaire Elon Musk, calling for its closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union representing CFPB employees filed two lawsuits against Vought on Sunday, accusing him of trying to shut down the agency -- which was created by Congress, and of giving the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to employees' personal information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vought's actions reflected "an unlawful attempt to thwart Congress's decision to create the CFPB to protect American consumers," the National Treasury Employees Union argued in one of the lawsuits.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFPB "has long functioned as another woke, weaponized arm of the bureaucracy that leverages its power against certain industries and individuals disfavored by so-called 'elites,'" the White House said in a statement published on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the administration of President Donald J. Trump, the weaponization ends right now," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to pause all work at CFPB and close down its offices appears to be an attempt to curtail its oversight powers without shuttering it entirely, something that would require congressional approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress built the CFPB, and no one other than Congress, not the president, not Musk, not Vought, can shut it down," Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who helped create the agency, said in a video message.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement, Democrats including Warren announced plans for a protest outside the CFPB's Washington offices for Monday, to "sound the alarm" against Musk and Vought's "attempt to kill" the agency. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian group Hamas said it will delay the release of more Israeli hostages planned for Saturday until further notice, according to a statement by the group’s spokesperson on Telegram.
 <br>
  <br>
  Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Qassam Brigades, said, “During the past three weeks, the resistance leadership has monitored the enemy’s violations and failure to abide by the terms of the agreement, including delaying the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, and targeting them with shelling and gunfire.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We affirm our commitment to the terms of the agreement as long as the occupation commits to them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday they completed their fifth hostage-prisoner exchange, with three Israeli hostages and 183 Palestinian prisoners released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz called the announcement by Hamas a "complete violation" of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said Palestinians would have no right of return to Gaza under his US takeover plan, describing his proposal in excerpts of an interview released on Monday as a "real estate development for the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told Fox News Channel's Bret Baier that "I would own it" and that there could be as many as six different sites for Palestinians to live outside Gaza under the plan, which the Arab world and others in the international community have rejected. (Agencies)

    World leaders debate AI challenges at Paris summit

<div class="itemFullText">
 Political and tech industry leaders descended on Paris on Monday for a two-day summit on artificial intelligence, hoping to find common ground on the revolutionary technology set to remake business and society across the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the summit aims to lay the groundwork for governing the nascent sector, as global powers race to play leading roles in the fast-developing technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's meeting of around 1,500 guests in the French capital's opulent Grand Palais will feature lectures and panel discussions outlining the promises of and challenges posed by AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Political leaders, including US Vice President JD Vance and Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, are set to rub shoulders with the likes of OpenAI boss Sam Altman and Google chief Sundar Pichai.
  <br>
  <br>
  A largely suit-wearing crowd of men and women speaking languages from all over the world gathered under the glass-and-steel dome of the great hall, built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selected companies, academics and non-profit groups were showing off their work with AI at stands around the cavernous space decked out with screens and geodesic domes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two years on from the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, able to respond to all kinds of natural-language prompts, "artificial intelligence fuels both immense hopes and, at times, exaggerated fear," Macron's AI envoy Anne Bouverot told guests as she opened the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  She promised a "turning point" that would bring more countries on board with AI development that until now has been restricted to a few advanced economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on the agenda is "sustainable development" of the resource- and energy-hungry technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know that AI can help mitigate climate change, but we also know that its current trajectory is unsustainable," Bouverot said. (AFP)

<img alt="Leftist candidate Luisa Gonzalez will compete in the run-off in April to try to unseat the incumbent Daniel Noboa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791001_1_20250210125151.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ecuador will choose its next president in a presidential run-off election after conservative incumbent Daniel Noboa and leftist lawyer Luisa González garnered enough votes on Sunday to beat 14 other candidates.
 <br>
  <br>
  The contest will be a repeat of the October 2023 snap election that earned Noboa a 16-month presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runoff election is set for April 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing supporters in Quito, Gonzalez hailed her stronger-than-expected showing against the conservative incumbent as a "victory" for the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures released by Ecuador’s National Electoral Council after 66 percent of ballots were tallied showed Noboa received more than 3.09 million votes, or 44.7 percent, while González earned over 3.02 million votes, or 43.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of Sunday's candidates promised voters to reduce the widespread crime that has plagued the country in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighbouring Colombia and Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  So many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses were a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years can turn Ecuador around or if Noboa deserves more time in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ecuador’s National Electoral Council reported that more than 83 percent of the roughly 13.7 million eligible voters cast ballots. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador. (Agencies)

    Trump at Super Bowl in first for sitting US president
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790989_1_20250210120317.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Bowl extravaganza was watched by a star-studded 65,719 crowd bristling with celebrities and VIPs headed by Donald Trump, who became the first sitting US president to attend the event after jetting into New Orleans from Florida on Air Force One earlier in the day following a round of golf with Tiger Woods.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has had an uneasy relationship with the NFL over the years, triggering uproar in 2017 after attacking players for kneeling in protest against racial injustice during renditions of the US national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the US leader was given a broadly positive reception at the Superdome after arriving at the venue shortly before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after arriving, Trump met with first responders and family members of victims of the January 1 attack in New Orleans that left 14 people dead and dozens wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, loud cheering could be heard among the crowd when the Superdome's giant screen showed Trump saluting during the national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  That warm applause was in stark contrast to the booing that rang around the venue early in the first quarter when the same screen showed pop icon Taylor Swift sitting in the VIP seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, expressed hope the nation could come together for the Super Bowl, which is by far the biggest annual event on the American sporting calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Football is America's most popular sport -- for good reason -- it fosters a sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together and strengthening communities," Trump said in a statement released by the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swift, watching boyfriend and Chiefs ace Travis Kelce, was among a galaxy of stars crowded into the venue, with the likes of Beatles legend Paul McCartney rubbing shoulders with Hollywood actors Kevin Costner, Paul Rudd and Anne Hathaway and soccer star Lionel Messi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The catcalls for Swift -- who backed Trump's opponent Kamala Harris in last year's election -- were not lost on the US President.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later shared a post on his TruthSocial network which read: "Trump gets massive cheers at the Super Bowl while Taylor Swift gets booed - the world is healing!" (AFP)

    Lamar entertains at Super Bowl with dig at Drake

<img alt="Kendrick Lamar was the main performance during the Super Bowl halftime show. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790985_1_20250210113933.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Kendrick Lamar entertained a packed stadium crowd and audiences around the world watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, teasing and then delivering his ubiquitous, Grammy-winning diss track "Not Like Us."
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Superdome in New Orleans, Lamar was introduced by actor Samuel L Jackson dressed in a top hat as Uncle Sam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dancers in all white, all red and all blue piled out of a Buick Grand National GNX, the car that inspired the name of Lamar's recent album "GNX."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Lamar spun through "Squabble Up," "DNA" and other hits before telling a group of female dancers: "I want to perform their favourite song, but you know they want to sue."
  <br>
  <br>
  A few beats of "Not Like Us" played, but Lamar switched to a duet of "Luther" with R&B singer SZA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" is part of a long-standing feud between Lamar and Canadian musician Drake, and there had been speculation that Lamar might skip the song at the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake filed a defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group, saying the song's false accusation that he is a paedophile has put him and his family in danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lamar went for it. At one point, he omitted the word "paedophiles" - opting instead for a scream - but included a line about seeking "A minor" in which the crowd sang along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" won five Grammy Awards a week ago, bringing Lamar's lifetime total to 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamar's appearance on the biggest stage in music followed big names from Beyonce to Prince, Madonna, Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Super Bowl typically draws more than 100 million live US viewers, the largest TV audience of the year. (Reuters)

    Trump to announce new steel, aluminium tariffs
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25-percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States, on top of existing metals duties, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And very simply, it's, if they charge us, we charge them," Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said that while the US government would allow Japan's Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management," Trump said of US Steel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former president Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump's announcement what would happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80 percent in 2019 after Trump's initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China's global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of steelmakers in Asia mostly fell on Monday, save for those with operations in the United States. The US dollar rose and US Treasury yields ticked higher. (Agencies)

 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed US President Donald Trump's widely criticised plan to move Palestinians out of the war-battered Gaza Strip, saying Israel is willing to "do the job".
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Fox News interview aired late on Saturday as the premier was wrapping up a visit to Washington, Netanyahu defended Trump's proposal, which has sparked concern and condemnation across the Middle East and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that President Trump's proposal is the first fresh idea in years, and it has the potential to change everything in Gaza," Netanyahu said, adding that it represents a "correct approach" to the future of the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All Trump is saying, 'I want to open the gate and give them an option to relocate temporarily while we rebuild the place physically'," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump "never said he wants American troops to do the job. Guess what? We'll do the job," Netanyahu declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel seized the Gaza Strip in 1967 and maintained a military presence in the territory until 2005, when it pulled out settlers and its troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  It subsequently imposed a crippling blockade on the Hamas-ruled territory and placed it under siege after the war began in October 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and armed groups in Gaza have fought several wars in recent years, but the latest -- sparked by the unprecedented 2023 Hamas attack on Israel -- has been the deadliest and most destructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said Trump's plan was a departure from the "same old, same old, same old -- we leave, Gaza becomes again occupied by these terrorists who use it as a base to attack Israel... It doesn't go anywhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we should pursue it," he added, cautioning that "the real issue" was finding a country that would agree to take in displaced Gazans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli leader also said that relocated Palestinians would have to "disavow terrorism" to be allowed to return to Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any attempts to force them out of Gaza would evoke dark memories of what the Arab world calls the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of Palestinians during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody describes Gaza as the biggest open-air prison in the world," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get the population out, allow them to leave. Not forcible eviction, not ethnic cleansing -- getting people out of what all these countries and all these do-gooders say is an open-air prison. Why are you keeping them in prison?" (AFP)

<img alt="The new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has vowed to reform Lebanon’s judiciary and battered economy. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790854_1_20250209024624.jpg&q=90">

 Lebanon’s new prime minister on Saturday formed the country’s first full-fledged government since 2022.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Joseph Aoun announced in a statement that he had accepted the resignation of the former caretaker government and signed a decree forming the new government with new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salam, a diplomat and former president of the International Court of Justice, vowed to “restore confidence between citizens and the state, between Lebanon and its Arab surroundings, and between Lebanon and the international community” and to implement reforms needed to bring the country out of an extended economic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Reform is the only path to a true salvation,” he said in a speech on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also promised to follow up on the implementation of a ceasefire agreement that ended the most recent war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group and political party Hezbollah in late November and to ensure that Israeli forces “withdraw from Lebanese territory until the last inch.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He pledged to ensure reconstruction in areas that suffered destruction during the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salam’s cabinet of 24 ministers, split evenly between Christian and Muslim sects, was formed less than a month after he was appointed and comes at a time when Lebanon is scrambling to rebuild its battered southern region and maintain security along its borders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though Hezbollah did not endorse Salam as prime minister, the group did engage in negotiations with the new prime minister over the Shiite Muslim seats in government, as per Lebanon’s power-sharing system.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was despite comments by US envoy Morgan Ortagus, who said in a speech in Beirut Friday that Washington had “set clear red lines from the United States” and that Hezbollah would not be “a part of the government.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments drew backlash from many in Lebanon who saw them as meddling in internal Lebanese affairs. (AP)
