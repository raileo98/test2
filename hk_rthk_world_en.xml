<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Wednesday it hoped for "peaceful coexistence" with the United States as Donald Trump appeared on the verge of a decisive victory over Kamala Harris in the country's presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our policy toward the United States has been consistent," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao did not comment directly on the possibility of Trump's re-election, but said "the United States presidential election is an internal affair of the United States".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We respect the choice of the American people," she said. "After the US election results are released and officially announced, we will handle related matters in accordance with usual practice," she added when asked if Chinese President Xi Jinping would call Trump to congratulate him. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Republican Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed victory in the 2024 US presidential contest after Fox News projected that he had defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, which would cap a stunning political comeback four years after he left the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  "America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate," he said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other news outlets had yet to call the race for Trump, but he appeared on the verge of winning after capturing the battleground states of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia and holding leads in the other four, according to Edison Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris did not speak to her supporters, who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly later on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We still have votes to count," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president was showing strength across broad swaths of the country, improving on his 2020 performance everywhere from rural areas to urban centres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans won a US Senate majority after flipping Democratic seats in West Virginia and Ohio. Neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump went into Election Day with a 50-50 chance of reclaiming the White House, a remarkable turnaround from January 6, 2021, when many pundits pronounced his political career to be over.
  <br>
  <br>
  That day, a mob of his supporters stormed Congress in a violent attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump picked up more support from Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and among lower-income households that have keenly felt the sting of price rises since the last presidential election in 2020, according to exit polls from Edison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump won 45 percent of Hispanic voters nationwide, trailing Harris with 53 percent but up 13 percentage points from 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 31 percent of voters said the economy was their top issue, and they voted for Trump by a 79-to-20 margin, according to exit polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 45 percent of voters across the country said their family's financial situation was worse off today than four years ago, and they favoured Trump 80 to 17 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global investors were increasingly pricing in a Trump win. US stock futures and the dollar pushed higher, while Treasury yields climbed and bitcoin rose – all flagged by analysts and investors as trades that favour a Trump victory. (Reuters)

    Republicans take control of US Senate

<img alt="The Capitol Building is seen from the National Mall in Washington DC. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777792_1_20241106141228.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Republican Party has wrested control of the US Senate from the Democrats, with at least 51 seats in the 100-member upper house of Congress, US networks projected early on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It gives the GOP a major power centre in Washington and a lead role in confirming the next president’s cabinet, as well as any Supreme Court justice if there is a vacancy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time the Republicans had a majority in the Senate was January 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Capitol is divided into the House of Representatives - where all 435 seats are up for grabs - and a 100-member Senate, which has 34 seats at stake this year. Congressional elections run alongside the White House race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim Justice, the sitting Republican governor of West Virginia, delighted Republicans early in the night when he emerged as an easy victor in the Senate race to replace retiring moderate Joe Manchin, an independent who voted with the Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohio then moved into the Republican column after longstanding Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown was defeated by Bernie Moreno, a Trump-endorsed businessman and the son of a one-time high-ranking Colombian government official.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats were looking to mitigate losses with gains in Texas and Florida, but conceded both as the sitting Republicans notched easy wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nonpartisan political finance monitor OpenSecrets reports that US$10 billion has been spent on candidates for Congress this cycle - a touch less than in 2020 but almost twice as much as the US$5.5 billion price tag for the 2024 White House race. (Agencies)

   US networks, including NBC, have called the state of Pennsylvania for Donald Trump. That puts him on the verge of a decisive victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Pennsylvania has a whopping 19 electoral votes.
   <br>
   <br>

   Fox News has declared Donald Trump the winner of the US presidential election, the sole network to make the call, after projecting he would win key battlegrounds Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. "Donald Trump elected as the next president of the United States," blared the front page of the Fox News website.

    <br>
    Share prices and bond yields have surged as the Republican party gained control of the Senate and Trump was leading in the still incomplete vote counts from Tuesday’s election. The full results may not be known for days as officials count all the votes, but investors already were repositioning in anticipation of gains by the Republicans, who took control of the Senate for the first time in four years.

    Americans in multiple states also voted on the issue of abortion on Tuesday. Voters in Missouri cleared the way to undo one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bans in one of four victories for abortion rights advocates, while Florida defeated a similar constitutional amendment, leaving in place a law barring most abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Colorado and Maryland.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Missouri and Florida results represent firsts in the abortion landscape, which underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion.

     2.14pm
    </b>
    <br>
    RTHK's correspondent in San Francisco Mark Niu said that with the first two swing states going to Trump, Pennsylvania is a must-win for Harris.
    <br>
    <br>
    "Pennsylvania is the most important one with 19 electoral votes, the most of the battleground states. It has become vital that Harris win that state to have any chance at all."
    <br>
    <br>
    Niu noted Republicans are also doing well in congressional races and that there is a high chance that Trump and his party could "come away with a clean sweep", where Republicans control both bodies of Congress and the presidency.

    Kamala Harris' campaign says she will not address her supporters on election night. "You won't hear from the vice president tonight but you will hear from her tomorrow," Cedric Richmond, Harris campaign co-chair, told a watch party at Howard University in Washington.
    <br>

     In contrast, the atmosphere at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and the watch party his campaign was holding in Palm Beach was increasingly celebratory.

     <br>
     Trump has won the key battleground state of Georgia, US media projected, flipping a state that voted Democratic in 2020. CNN and NBC News made the call in the Republican former president's favour.
     <br>
     <br>
     <b>
      1.32pm
     </b>
     <br>
     The Associated Press is reporting that Trump is leading in the battleground state of Georgia by slightly under 120,000 votes with more than 90 percent of the estimated votes counted.
     <br>
     <br>
     Trump is en route to his watch party from Mar-a-Lago in Florida where he’s expected to speak tonight to his gathered supporters, while Harris is not planning to address the public during the night, according to a person familiar with the White House.
     <br>
     <br>
     All polls are closed in the US. According to AP, Trump is ahead with 230 electoral votes, while Harris has 210.

     <br>
     RTHK's San Francisco correspondent, Mark Niu, says Trump has a commanding lead so far. The Associated Press shows Trump narrowly leading in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which comes with the most electoral votes at 19. He said this was ironic, given that the state has the third largest Puerto Rican population in the US mainland, and that Trump called it a "floating island of garbage".
     <br>
     <br>
     "In exit polling, it appears that Trump is actually doing well among Latino voters," Niu said.

      US networks are projecting Trump will win North Carolina, the first of seven battleground states. CNN, NBC and ABC News all called the race in Trump's favour in the southeastern state, which he also won in the 2020 election.

       Harris has won California, taking its huge slate of 54 electoral votes, while Trump was projected to win in Idaho and Iowa, US networks said. Harris also won in the West Coast state of Oregon. So far, that gives Trump 211 electoral votes and Harris 153.
       <br>
       <br>
       RTHK's San Francisco correspondent Mark Niu said the race is still far from over and that the wins that have been projected so far were expected. He added that attention is on the key swing states, adding Harris' performance was not as strong as expected.
       <br>
       <br>
       "It's margins in places like Virginia, where Harris is barely winning, when she was expected to dominate that have caused great concern for Democrats."

        Republicans are also vying for control of the US House and Senate. While all eyes are on the White House race, hundreds of congressional elections will determine how much of the next president's agenda gets enacted.
        <br>
        <br>
        Republicans are nudging ahead in their mission to wrest control of the Senate from the Democrats. US media have reported that Republican Bernie Moreno, a onetime car dealer who was born in Colombia, flipped an additional Senate seat for his party, besting a Democratic incumbent who has held the post since 2007. Republicans need to net just two Senate seats to win a majority in the chamber.

        Trump has called into a Wisconsin radio station to say: “I’m watching these results. So far so good". Harris did phone interviews with radio stations in the battleground states, then visited Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington carrying a box of Doritos – her go-to snack.
        <br>
        <br>
        The closeness of the race and the number of states in play raised the likelihood that, once again, a victor might not be known on election night. Trump said on Tuesday that he had no plans to tell his supporters to refrain from violence if Harris wins, because they “are not violent people”. Federal, state and local officials have expressed confidence in the integrity of the nation’s election systems. And both sides have armies of lawyers in anticipation of legal challenges on and after Election Day.

         "I think if there are more tariffs, if there are more investment restrictions, this is going to restrict trade flows, investment flows and ultimately capital flows.

          Trump and Harris are so far notching early wins in reliably Republican and Democratic states. Polls have closed in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin and North Carolina, six of the seven closely fought battlegrounds expected to decide the election, but the results there were too early to call. But results from the other states are tumbling in with US media projecting wins for Trump in Louisiana and Mississippi. Harris meanwhile, has won the big prize state of Illinois.

             US investigators are looking into apparent hoax bomb threats that were directed at polling locations in four battleground states - Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin as voting was underway.
             <br>

             "None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far," the FBI said in a statement, adding that election integrity was among the bureau's highest priorities.

             <br>
             "They're up to mischief, it seems. They don't want us to have a smooth, fair and accurate election, and if they can get us to fight among ourselves, they can count that as a victory," Raffensperger told reporters.

             "We would like to emphasize that Russia has not interfered and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, including the United States," the embassy said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday a large-scale medical evacuation was planned from Gaza this week, with more than 100 seriously ill and injured patients due to leave the war-ravaged territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said that, alongside its partners, it would evacuate as many as 113 patients on Wednesday, with most going to the United Arab Emirates and some heading to Romania for specialised care.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it goes ahead, it would be the largest evacuation from Gaza since October 2023, according to data from the UN health agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories, said he was hopeful the evacuation would go ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said efforts were currently under way to bring patients from various hospitals across the Gaza Strip to the Gaza European Hospital near Khan Yunis in the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will be transported to the Kerem Shalom crossing on early Wednesday and then flown on to the UAE and Romania, Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva, via video link from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those on the list figure among up to 14,000 people currently waiting in Gaza to be evacuated out of the territory for medical reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of them have sustained trauma injuries in the war and the others are suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the war in Gaza began following Hamas' deadly October 7, 2023 attack inside Israel, fewer than 5,000 people have been granted medical evacuations out of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only 282 have meanwhile been able to leave since Israel shuttered Gaza's main Rafah border crossing in early May, Peeperkorn said, adding that around a third of them had been children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peeperkorn lamented the "ad hoc" access to desperately-needed medical evacuations from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we need is regular access... which would be properly supported, facilitated and not made unnecessarily dangerous," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need medical corridors, and the first medical corridor we basically request to be restored is the traditional referral pathway from Gaza to East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and... a second medical corridor to Egypt should be open again, and maybe to Jordan."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,391 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health ministry figures which the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Election Day voting began in the United States on Tuesday after an extraordinary, and for many unnerving, presidential race that will either make Kamala Harris the first woman president in the country's history or hand Donald Trump a comeback that sends shockwaves around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the first polling stations opened, Democratic vice president Harris, 60, and Republican former president Trump, 78, were dead-even in the tightest and most volatile White House contest of modern times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bitter rivals spent their final day of the campaign frenetically working to get their supporters out to the polls and trying to win over any last undecided voters in the swing states expected to decide the outcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite a series of head-spinning twists in the campaign – from Harris's dramatic entrance when President Joe Biden dropped out in July, to Trump riding out two assassination attempts and a criminal conviction – nothing has broken the deadlock in the opinion polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polling stations opened from 6.00am in states including Virginia, North Carolina and New York. Tens of millions of voters are expected to cast their ballots, on top of the more than 82 million people who have already voted early in the preceding weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  A final outcome may not be known for several days if the results are as close as the polls suggest, adding to the tension in a deeply divided nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  And there are fears of turmoil and even violence if Trump loses, and then contests the result as he did in 2020, with barriers erected around the White House and businesses boarded up in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world is anxiously watching, as the outcome will have major implications for conflicts in the Middle East, for Russia's war in Ukraine, and for tackling climate change which Trump calls a hoax.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris and Trump are effectively tied in the seven main swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of the vote, Harris went all-in on the must-win state of Pennsylvania, rallying on the Philadelphia steps made famous in the "Rocky" movie and declaring: "momentum is on our side."
  <br>
  <br>
  However "this could be one of the closest races in history – every single vote matters," cautioned Harris, who was joined by celebrities including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who would become the first convicted felon and oldest person to win the presidency, cast himself as the only solution to an apocalyptic vision of the country in terminal decline and overrun by "savage" migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America – indeed, the world – to new heights of glory," Trump told his closing rally in Grand Rapids in the key swing state of Michigan, after touring North Carolina and Pennsylvania. (AFP)

    Harris, Trump make final pitch to US voters

<img alt='Donald Trump has promised to lead the United States to "new heights of glory". Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777642_2_20241105150616.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris and Donald Trump made their final case on Monday in the hours before Election Day, when voters will either choose America's first woman president or hand the Republican an unprecedented comeback.
 <br>
  <br>
  With polls showing a dead heat, Trump promised to lead the United States to "new heights of glory" while Harris said the "momentum is on our side", as the rivals held their last rallies of the 2024 race in crucial battleground states.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Vice President finished on a high note in Philadelphia in the must-win state of Pennsylvania, with a rally on the steps immortalised by the boxing movie "Rocky". "This could be one of the closest races in history – every single vote matters," said Harris, who was joined by celebrities, including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also referenced the film, telling thousands of supporters that "here at these famous steps" she was paying "tribute to those who start as the underdog and climb to victory".
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris, 60, has repeatedly said she is the underdog, having only joined the race three months ago after President Joe Biden dropped out. But she insisted she would win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former president Trump brought several family members up on stage at his closing rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America – indeed, the world – to new heights of glory," he told the crowd, as the clocks ticked over into Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, also called on people to turn up on election day, saying his supporters can "put ourselves in a position to win, which we can do very easily if we show up".
  <br>
  <br>
  The world is watching as the outcome will have major implications for conflicts in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, and for tackling climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  And with Trump having narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July and police foiling a second alleged plot, the fears of violence are very real.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington, growing numbers of businesses and office buildings are being boarded up in case of unrest. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea has fined Facebook-parent Meta more than US$15 million for illegally collecting sensitive user information from nearly a million people without consent and sharing it with advertisers, the country's data watchdog said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which also owns Instagram, ran afoul of laws prohibiting the use of information on political opinions, religious beliefs and people's sex life unless the individual provides explicit consent, Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the tech giant collected sensitive information from around 980,000 domestic users in South Korea through their Facebook profiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  This included details about their religious beliefs and whether they are in a same-sex relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said it had confirmed that such information was provided to advertisers by Meta, with around 4,000 advertisers using it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta "analysed user behaviour data, including pages liked and ads clicked on Facebook", to create and implement targeted advertising related to "sensitive themes" such as transgender issues, homosexuality and North Korean defectors, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission said on Tuesday it had decided to fine Meta 21.6 billion won or US$15.6 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it "also ordered the company to establish legal grounds for processing sensitive information, implement safety measures, and respond diligently to users' requests for access to their personal data". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will visit China this week, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, on his first foreign tour as he seeks a more prominent position for Jakarta on the world stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 73-year-old ex-general's state visit will take place from Friday to Sunday, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo was sworn in on October 20, pledging to stick to Jakarta's traditionally non-aligned foreign policy while making the world's fourth-most populous nation more active abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  On his first planned foreign visits since taking power, Prabowo will also travel to Peru and Brazil for the Apec and G20 summits.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also expected to go to the United States and Britain, newspaper Kompas reported last month, citing presidential palace sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his February election win, Prabowo used his eight-month transition period to visit more than a dozen countries – including China – to showcase a more active foreign policy than his predecessor Joko Widodo, who focused more on domestic issues like the economy. (AFP)

    North Korea stages more missile launches

 North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea on Tuesday, its neighbours said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations hours before the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said at least seven North Korean missiles flew as far as 400 kilometres with a maximum altitude of 100 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  “North Korea’s actions, including a series of repeated missile launches, threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international community,” Nakatani said.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's military also detected several missile launches by North Korea and subsequently boosted its surveillance posture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The North Korean missiles could be used to target key facilities in South Korea, including US military bases there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launches came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to reach the US mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to that launch, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force.
  <br>
  <br>
  That drew condemnation from Kim’s powerful sister Kim Yo-jong, who on Tuesday accused North Korea’s rivals of raising tensions with “aggressive and adventuristic military threats.”
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean officials have said that North Korea was likely to dial up its military displays around the US presidential election to command the attention of Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s military intelligence agency said last week that North Korea has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside officials and analysts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win concessions such as sanctions relief after a new US president is elected. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Putin met North Korea's foreign minister in the Kremlin on Monday amid mounting concern in the West that North Korean soldiers are about to enter the Ukraine war on Moscow's side.
 <br>
  <br>
  Video of the meeting showed the pair shaking hands for a full minute as Putin greeted Choe Son Hui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin noted that they were meeting on Russia's National Unity Day, a public holiday, and Choe conveyed "sincere, warm, comradely greetings" from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States says North Korea has sent some 10,000 troops to Russia, including 8,000 to the western Kursk region where Russia is still battling to expel Ukrainian troops who broke across the border in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin, who signed a treaty with Kim in June that includes a mutual defence clause, has neither confirmed nor denied the North Korean troop presence. He has said that Russia is free to implement the pact as it sees fit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian leader briefly alluded to the military situation in Kursk when he met youth volunteers earlier on Monday, telling them: "When the enemy is cleaned out from the region, there will be lots of work for you to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Kyiv, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said he had discussed with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock the "need for decisive action" in response to North Korean involvement in the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said North Korean troops were waging "an aggressive war in Europe against a sovereign European state".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week urged Kyiv's allies to stop just "watching" and start taking action to tackle the presence of the North Koreans. (Reuters)

    EU and South Korea discuss security issues

<div class="itemFullText">
 The dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia as Moscow wages war in Ukraine highlights the need for security cooperation between the European Union and South Korea, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The deployment "regrettably illustrates the importance of our shared security agenda," he said before talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul in Seoul. The EU and South Korea are holding their first Strategic Dialogue meeting after Washington and Seoul sounded the alarm about North Korea sending troops to help Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Borrell also met South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun and expressed concern over the development, the South Korean defence ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an existential threat," Borrell said in a post on X and also posted a photo of him shaking hands with Kim. "The Republic of Korea is best positioned to understand it. We are united in our support to Ukraine. I encouraged them to step it up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Borrell said in a post on X on Sunday that he had visited the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas after arriving in South Korea following a trip to Japan, and described the visit as reminder of the need to invest more in peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said in another post that he was visiting South Korea to take security and defence cooperation between the EU and Seoul to "the next level", but gave no further details. Cho said last week that all possible scenarios were under consideration, when asked about whether Seoul could send weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea aiding Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including mine clearance equipment, but has resisted Kyiv's requests for weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul also sees it as likely that the North will be compensated by Moscow with military and civilian technology, as it races to launch a spy satellite and upgrade its missile capabilities. North Korea last week flexed its military muscle with the test of a huge new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed Hwasong-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington expects North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, to enter the fight against Ukraine soon, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  At talks in Moscow on Friday, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said her country intended to back Russia until it achieves victory in the Ukraine war. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia will spend A$600 million (US$395 million) on defence reserve recruitment and extending a cash bonus to retain troops as the centre-left Albanese government seeks to overcome workforce shortages, officials are expected to announce on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A review of Australia's defence force last year identified severe workforce pressures as a priority issue, even as the government lifts its defence budget to a record A$51.5 billion annually, revamping its northern military bases and acquiring long range strike capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  A defence workforce plan expected to be released on Tuesday cites a competitive national labour market and record low levels of unemployment as putting pressure on defence's ability to recruit, according to excerpts viewed by Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bonus scheme introduced last year will be extended until 2028 and expanded through the middle ranks, offering A$40,000 to defence force members who stay to "address hollowness in the force", the plan says.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Defence aims to achieve a permanent defence workforce of 69,000 by the early 2030s, with an overall combined defence and civilian workforce of around 100,000 by 2040, the plan says.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, there were around 57,000 permanent defence personnel, falling short of funded positions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our ADF personnel are our greatest capability, which is why it is crucial that the Defence workforce has the people it needs to help protect Australia’s strategic interests," Defence Minister Richard Marles said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia is spending up to A$368 billion to acquire nuclear powered submarines under the Aukus partnership with the United States and Britain, and has also allocated A$74 billion for missile systems, as it responds to rising tensions with China in the Indo Pacific region.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Australia cancelled a multibillion-dollar military satellite project with Lockheed Martin, saying it would instead shift its focus to a multi-orbit system to increase resilience for the Australian Defence Force. (Reuters)

    Legendary music producer Quincy Jones dies aged 91

<img alt="Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777508_2_20241104162429.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic "Thriller" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died on Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones’ passing," the family said in a statement. “And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical catalogue that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for "Roots" and "In the Heat of the Night," organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of “We Are the World,” the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lionel Richie, who co-wrote “We Are the World" and was among the featured singers, would call Jones “the master orchestrator.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In a career which began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, top honours likely go to his productions with Jackson: “Off the Wall,” “Thriller” and “Bad” were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones’ versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the “King of Pop.” On such classic tracks as “Billie Jean” and “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,” Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For “Thriller,” some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing “Beat It” and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Thriller” sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles’ “Greatest Hits 1971-1975” among others as the best-selling album of all time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If an album doesn’t do well, everyone says ‘it was the producers fault’; so if it does well, it should be your ‘fault,’ too,” Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. “The tracks don’t just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The list of his honours and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography “Q”, including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for “Roots.” He also received France’s Legion d’Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Centre tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, “Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones” and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author. (AP)

    Morales vows to continue his defiance of Bolivian govt

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bolivia's former President Evo Morales insisted on Sunday that he would press on with a hunger strike until the government of his protégé-turned-rival agreed to a political dialogue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Morales' supporters have blocked roads and caused disruptions around the country in protest against what they say is the government's political persecution of the former Bolivian leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morales, a larger-than-life figure still towering over Bolivian politics five years after his ouster, spoke on his third day without food from Chapare, Bolivia’s rural coca-growing region that serves as his stronghold.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My fight is to improve the situation in the country and to start a dialogue without conditions on two fronts, one economic and one political,” Morales told reporters from the office of the coca growers’ federation that he long has led.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president said he began his hunger strike on Friday in the hope that "international organisations or friendly governments" would facilitate talks with his political nemesis, President Luis Arce .
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions have surged over the past three weeks since pro-Morales supporters set up crippling roadblocks aimed at rebuking Arce — Morales' former economy minister with whom he is now vying to lead Bolivia’s governing socialist party into next year’s elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since mid-October, protesters have choked off major highways in defiance of an attempt by Arce's government to revive a 2016 statutory rape case against Morales, an ethnic Aymara who was the first member of an indigenous community to become the president of Latin America’s only indigenous-majority nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, the disruptions in transport have cost the South American country more than US$1.7 billion, according to Bolivia's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morales has denied any wrongdoing and rejects the charges as politically motivated.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My crime is being indigenous,” he said on Sunday. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least six people died after a volcano in eastern Indonesia erupted several times overnight, officials said on Monday, raising the alert level to the highest of a four-tiered system.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, located on the popular tourist island of Flores, spewed a tower of ash and lava on nearby villages that were forced to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to our coordination with the local authorities, six fatalities have been confirmed," Abdul Muhari, spokesman of the country's disaster management agency said on Monday in an interview on Kompas TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video clips showed villages near the volcano covered by thick ash, with some areas on fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country's volcanology agency raised the alert level to the highest mark, and told locals and tourists not to carry out activities within a seven-kilometre radius of the crater.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There has been a significant increase in volcanic activity on Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki," it said in a press release.
  <br>
  <br>
  It warned there was a potential for rain-induced lava floods and told locals to wear masks to avoid the effects of volcanic ash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mountain had several major eruptions in January, prompting authorities at the time to raise the alert status to the highest level and evacuate at least 2,000 residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent eruptions due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an area of intense volcanic and seismic activity. (AFP)

    Pro-EU Sandu claims victory in Moldova election

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Moldova’s Western-friendly President Maia Sandu won a second term in a presidential runoff against her opponent who was seen as preferring closer ties with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a race which was overshadowed by accusations of Russian interference, voter fraud, and intimidation in the European Union candidate country.
  <br>
  <br>
  With nearly 99 percent of votes counted in the second round of the presidential election held on Sunday, Sandu had 55 percent of the vote, according to the Central Electoral Commission, or CEC, compared with 45 percent for Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general who was backed by the pro-Russia Party of Socialists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result will be a major relief to those who backed Sandu’s candidacy and her push for Moldova becoming a member of the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Moldova, you are victorious! Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova!” Sandu said after claiming victory after midnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  She went on to claim that her country's vote had faced an “unprecedented attack" through alleged schemes including dirty money, vote-buying, and electoral interference “by hostile forces from outside the country" and criminal groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have shown that nothing can stand in the way of the people’s power when they choose to speak through their vote," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the final vote count, Stoianoglo told the media that “everyone’s voice deserves respect” and that he hopes “from now on, we will put an end to the hatred and division imposed on us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear if he had publicly commented on his electoral defeat. (AP)

    Angry crowds throw mud at Spain's king in Valencia

<div class="itemFullText">
 Furious locals hurled mud and insults at Spain's king, queen and prime minister on Sunday in a startling show of anger in the worst hit town in the flood disaster that has killed more than 210 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  More heavy rain fell on the Valencia region after King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were forced to leave Paiporta where more than 70 people died in floods last Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mud hit the monarchs in the face and clothes as they tried to calm the angry crowd in scenes that underscored the fury over the response to the disaster that has now killed at least 217 people with many more still missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The king and queen went to a crisis centre in Paiporta. But extra security guards soon had to keep the angry crowd away from the royals and prime minister. They put up umbrellas to stop mud hitting the royal couple.
  <br>
  <br>
  The king said later that Spain had to "understand the anger and frustration" of people affected by the devastation to towns where cars have been left in muddy heaps in streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a social media video, the king called on the public to give the victims "hope and their guarantee that the state in its entirety is present".
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the fury seemed directed at Prime Minister Sanchez and Valencia regional government head Carlos Mazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand the social anger and of course, I'm here to receive it. This is my political and moral obligation," Mazon said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rear window of Sanchez's car was broken before he and the local politicians quickly left. The socialist leader said that while he empathised with the "anguish and suffering" of the victims, he condemned "all forms of violence".
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency services on Sunday listed 213 dead in the Valencia region, one in Andalusia in the south and three in Castilla-La Mancha neighbouring Valencia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have warned the toll could rise as vehicles trapped in tunnels and underground car parks are cleared. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A top Slovak mountaineer died on a descent of the 7,234-metre Langtang Lirung peak in Nepal after an historic ascent up its east face, Slovakia's climbers association said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ondrej Huserka, a member of the Slovak national mountaineering team who had climbed in the Alps, Patagonia, Pamir Mountains and Himalayas, fell into a crevasse on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Czech climbing partner Marek Holecek said that the pair had just completed the first-ever ascent of the Langtang Lirung peak via the east face.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovak climbers association SHS James called for rescue action on Facebook but then said on Sunday that the helicopter could not take off because of bad weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Holecek confirmed the death in an emotional post on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Huserka had "hit an angled surface after an eight-metre drop, then continued down a labyrinth into the depths of the glacier".
  <br>
  <br>
  Holecek added that he had spent hours trying to rescue Huserka but failed as the Slovak was trapped head down and apparently paralysed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I rappelled down to him and stayed with him for four hours until his light faded. There's nothing more to add," Holecek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  SHS James said that the weather in Nepal would prevent rescue action in the days to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Following a phone call with Marek Holecek and his status published yesterday, and given the weather conditions under Langtang Lirung, the family and friends will have to cope with the fact that Ondrej is not with us any more," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovak daily SME described the 34-year-old Huserka as "one of the best Slovak mountaineers" who focused on rock and ice climbing. (AFP)

 Europe will need to rethink its support of Ukraine if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Sunday, as the continent "will not be able to bear the burdens of the war alone".
 <br>
  <br>
  Orban opposes military aid to Ukraine and has made clear he thinks Trump shares his views and would negotiate a peace settlement for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  He backs former president Trump, the Republican candidate, to beat Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in Tuesday's US election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We (in Europe) need to realise that if there will be a pro-peace president in America, which I not only believe in but I also read the numbers that way... if what we expect happens and America becomes pro-peace, then Europe cannot remain pro-war," Orban said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine will be high on the agenda when European leaders meet in Budapest in the coming week, he said, referring to a European Political Community meeting and a more informal meeting of EU leaders due to take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Europe cannot bear the burden of [the war] alone, and if Americans switch to peace, then we also need to adapt, and this is what we will discuss in Budapest," Orban said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe is jittery about how the outcome of the US election will affect the war in Ukraine and the continent's security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orban has angered Brussels with his close ties to Russia and opposition to aid for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said in July that the Hungarian government sees Trump as a "chance for peace" in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, Orban said his team was assisting Trump's aides with policies on families and migration. On Thursday, he called Trump to wish him good luck ahead of Tuesday's election. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday claimed to have captured another Ukrainian village, just a dozen kilometres from the key eastern logistics hub Pokrovsk, as its troops advance rapidly.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Russian defence ministry said it had "liberated the settlement of Vichneve following offensive operations".
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has been making swift advances in the eastern Donetsk region for weeks, taking dozens of towns and villages.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Moscow said its forces had captured the large village of Kurakhivka close to the industrial town of Kurakhove, which Russia is also aiming to capture, and the small village of Pershotravneve in the Kharkiv region close to the eastern Lugansk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Capturing Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukraine that connects several fortresses in the Donbas, is one of Russia's main objectives in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also home to a major coke coal mine that is crucial to Ukraine's steel production for its military.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian troops have advanced to just a few kilometres outside the town.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian army took 478 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory in October, according to an AFP analysis of data from the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
  <br>
  <br>
  That marks a record since the first weeks of the conflict in March 2022. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A 15-year-old boy shot in the head during a bloody shootout between drug gangs in the west of France on Saturday died of his wounds, the regional prosecutor announced, as the interior minister warned the country was at risk of "Mexicanisation" due to rising drug crime.
 <br>
  <br>
  The teen had been in intensive care since the shootings Thursday evening in the city of Poitiers, which have raised alarm nationwide over increasing violence in gangland turf wars that are making the streets unsafe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four other minors, aged between 15 and 16, were also injured by gunshots fired in front of a restaurant in the city in the incident which involved dozens of people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers used tear gas to break up the fight, restoring order around 45 minutes after arriving on the scene, the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on Friday that France's struggle with drug-related violence is at a "tipping point," with the nation facing a choice between "full mobilisation or the 'Mexicanisation' of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexico has suffered more than 450,000 drug-related killings since the government started using the military to fight its notorious drug cartels in 2006.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gangland violence long associated with the Mediterranean port city Marseille has expanded into other French cities in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims can include gang members, some of them minors guarding dealing spots or employed as hitmen, but also innocent bystanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Poitiers' experience on Thursday was "unprecedented" for the city of 90,000, mayor Leonore Moncond'huy said, adding that it "demonstrated rather serious developments in society."
  <br>
  <br>
  Retailleau, a member of the right-wing Republicans and seen as a hardliner on security issues, has called for the battle against drug violence to become a "nationwide effort" since becoming interior minister in Prime Minister Michel Barnier's shaky minority government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 'narco thugs' have no limits any more... These shootouts aren't happening in South America, they're happening in Rennes, in Poitiers... we're at a tipping point," Retailleau told BFMTV. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Air pollution in Pakistan's second biggest city Lahore soared on Saturday, around 40 times over the level deemed acceptable by the World Health Organisation (WHO), data from IQAir showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The level of deadly PM2.5 pollutants – fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health – peaked at 610, with a reading above 15 in a 24-hour period considered unhealthy by the WHO.
  <br>
  <br>
  The air quality index, which measures a range of pollutants, also spiked at 1,067.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have never reached a level of 1,000," said Jahangir Anwar, a senior environmental protection official in Lahore.
  <br>
  <br>
  For days, Lahore has been enveloped by smog, a mix of fog and pollutants caused by low-grade diesel fumes, smoke from seasonal agricultural burning and winter cooling.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the provincial environmental protection agency announced new restrictions in four "hot spots" in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuk-tuks equipped with polluting two-stroke engines are banned, as are restaurants that barbecue without filters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government offices and private companies will have half their staff work from home starting on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Construction work has been halted and street and food vendors, who often cook over open fires, must close at 8 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smog is particularly pronounced in winter when cold, denser air traps emissions from poor-quality fuels used to power the city's vehicles and factories at ground level. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 5.48-metre Australian crocodile that held the world record as the largest crocodile in captivity has died, a wildlife sanctuary said on Saturday. He was thought to be more than 110 years old.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cassius, weighing in at more than one ton, had been in declining health since October 15, Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat said on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was very old and believed to be living beyond the years of a wild Croc," according to a post by the organisation, based on Green Island near the Queensland tourist town of Cairns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cassius will be deeply missed, but our love and memories of him will remain in our hearts forever."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's website said he had lived at the sanctuary since 1987 after being transported from the neighbouring Northern Territory, where crocodiles are a key part of the region's tourist industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cassius, a saltwater crocodile, held the Guinness World Records title as the world's largest crocodile in captivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He took the title after the 2013 death of Philippines crocodile Lolong, who measured 6.17 metres long, according to Guinness. (Reuters)

    Badenoch elected new leader of UK Conservative Party

<img alt="Kemi Badenoch has called for a return to conservative values. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777338_1_20241102194657.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 "Anti-woke" candidate Kemi Badenoch on Saturday won the vote to become the UK Conservatives' new leader, replacing Rishi Sunak who quit after the party's disastrous showing in July's general election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Badenoch, 44, came out on top in the two-horse race with former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, winning 57 percent of the votes of party members.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that becoming party leader was an "enormous honour," but that "the task that stands before us is tough."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to be honest about the fact we made mistakes" and "let standards slip," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is time to get down to business, it is time to renew," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The combative former equalities minister now faces the daunting task of reuniting a divided and weakened party that was emphatically ousted from power in July after 14 years in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badenoch will become the official leader of the opposition and face off against Labour's Keir Starmer in the House of Commons every Wednesday for the traditional Prime Minister's Questions.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, she will be leading a much-reduced cohort of Tory MPs in the chamber following the party's dismal election showing.
  <br>
  <br>
  She must plot a strategy to regain public trust while stemming the flow of support to the right-wing Reform UK party, led by Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having campaigned on a right-wing platform, she also faces the prospect of future difficulties within the ranks of Tory lawmakers, which includes many centrists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badenoch, born in London to Nigerian parents and raised in Lagos, has called for a return to conservative values, accusing her party of having become increasingly liberal on societal issues such as gender identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  She describes herself as a straight-talker, a trait that has caused controversy on the campaign trail.
  <br>
  <br>
  When addressing immigration, Badenoch said that "not all cultures are equally valid" when deciding who should be allowed to live in the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was widely criticised after suggesting that statutory maternity pay on small businesses was "excessive" and sparked further furore when she joked that up to 10 percent of Britain's half a million civil servants were so bad that they "should be in prison." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain will deploy 10,000 more troops and police officers to the eastern Valencia region devastated by historic floods that have killed 211 people, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of finding survivors more than three days after torrents of muddy water submerged towns and wrecked infrastructure were slim in the European country's deadliest such disaster in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all the deaths have been recorded in the eastern Valencia region, where thousands of security and emergency services personnel were frantically clearing debris and mud in the search for bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez said in a televised address that the disaster was the second deadliest flood in Europe this century and announced a huge increase in the security forces for relief works.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had accepted the Valencia region leader's request for 5,000 more troops and informed him of a further deployment of 5,000 police officers and civil guards, Sanchez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain was carrying out its largest deployment of army and security force personnel in peacetime, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Restoring order and distributing aid to destroyed towns and villages – some of which have been cut off from food, water and power for days – is a priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have come under fire over the adequacy of warning systems before the floods, and some stricken residents have complained the response to the disaster is too slow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am aware the response is not enough, there are problems and severe shortages... towns buried by mud, desperate people searching for their relatives," Sanchez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Susana Camarero, deputy head of the Valencia region, told journalists on Saturday that essential supplies had been delivered "from day one" to all accessible settlements.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was "logical" that affected residents were asking for more, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in the Valencia region have restricted access to roads for two days to allow emergency services to carry out search, rescue and logistics operations more effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have said dozens of people remain unaccounted for.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with telephone and transport networks severely damaged, establishing a precise figure is difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska on Friday told Cadena Ser radio station that it was "reasonable" to believe more fatalities would emerge.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also hoped that the estimated number of missing people will fall once telephone and internet services are running again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of ordinary citizens pushing shopping trolleys and carrying cleaning equipment took to the streets on Friday to help with the clean-up effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Camarero said some municipalities were "overwhelmed by the amount of solidarity and food" they had received.
  <br>
  <br>
  The surge in togetherness continued on Saturday as around 1,000 people set off from the Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia towards nearby towns laid waste by the floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have urged them to stay at home to avoid congestion on the roads that would hamper the work of emergency services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm that sparked the floods on Tuesday formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for this time of year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But scientists warn that climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events. (AFP)

 Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed on Saturday to respond to attacks by Israel and its ally the United States against Tehran and groups it supports in the region.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The enemies, both the USA and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a tooth-breaking response to what they are doing against Iran, the Iranian nation, and the resistance front," said Khamenei at a student gathering in Tehran, referring to the alliance of Tehran-backed groups that include Yemen's Houthis, Lebanese Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes as Washington announced the deployment of additional military assets to the Middle East, including ballistic missile defense destroyers and long-range B-52 bomber aircraft, serving as a warning to Iran as it and Israel trade tit-for-tat strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it had launched rockets at an Israeli intelligence base near Tel Aviv in the early hours of Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hezbollah and Israel exchanged cross-border fire for nearly a year after Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war, before Israel ramped up the conflict on September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group frequently claims to have fired rockets at Israeli bases or urban areas in Israeli territory, and has several times claimed the targeting of Glilot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said on Saturday that sirens were activated following the arrival of "suspicious aerial targets" from Lebanon and the targets remained under surveillance in an ongoing incident. (AFP)

    Japan urges 200,000 to evacuate due to heavy rain

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 200,000 people in western Japan were urged to evacuate on Saturday as authorities warned of landslides and floods while the remnants of a tropical storm trickle over the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Japan Meteorological Agency said "warm, moist air... was causing heavy rainfall with thunderstorms in western Japan" partly due to Kong-rey, which was downgraded to an extratropical low-pressure system from a typhoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city of Matsuyama "issued the top-level warning, urging 189,552 residents in its 10 districts to evacuate and immediately secure safety," a city official told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the evacuation was not mandatory, Japan's highest-level warning is typically issued when it is extremely likely that some kind of disaster has already occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters warned that landslides and floods could affect western Japan on Saturday and eastern Japan on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Due to rain, shinkansen bullet trains were briefly suspended between Tokyo and southern Fukuoka region in the morning before resuming on a delayed schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kong-rey smashed into Taiwan on Thursday as one of the biggest storms to hit the island in decades. It claimed at least two lives and knocked out power to tens of thousands of households.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say human-driven climate change is intensifying the risk posed by heavy rains because a warmer atmosphere holds more water. (AFP)

    'Brat' named word of the year by Collins dictionary

<img alt="Thanks to singer Charli XCX the word 'brat' now means a lot more than simply a badly-behaved child. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777242_1_20241101192506.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brat, the word redefined by singer Charli XCX and adopted by supporters of US presidential candidate Kamala Harris, was on Friday named the Collins Word of the Year 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Brat" was the name of the UK singer's hit sixth album, and the word has now come to represent a "confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude," said Collins, rather than simply a term for a badly-behaved child.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Inspired by the Charli XCX album, 'brat' has become one of the most talked about words of 2024," said the UK-based dictionary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than a hugely successful album, 'brat' is a cultural phenomenon that has resonated with people globally, and 'brat summer' established itself as an aesthetic and a way of life," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old pop star, whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison, described the typical brat girl as someone "who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes, who feels herself, but then also maybe has a breakdown, but kind of parties through it."
  <br>
  <br>
  She tweeted in July that "Kamala IS brat," in reference to the US Vice President, prompting the presidential nominee to use her song "365" in one of her TikTok videos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her campaign account also re-branded with a lime green photo in the style of the Brat album cover.
  <br>
  <br>
  The album hit number one in her native UK and number three in the US. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers on Friday raised the death toll in Spain's worst floods for a generation to at least 205 as the government deployed more troops in an increasingly desperate search for survivors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The floods that have tossed vehicles, collapsed bridges and covered towns with mud since Tuesday are the European country's deadliest such disaster in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organisation coordinating emergency services in the hardest-hit eastern Valencia region said 202 people had been confirmed dead there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in neighbouring Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia had already announced a combined three deaths in their regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers equipped with drones and sniffer dogs waded through the water and rummaged through debris in search of the dozens of people the authorities believe are still missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is deploying an extra 500 troops to the stricken areas to bolster the 1,200 already on site for search, rescue and logistics tasks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some cut-off areas remain without water, food or power three days after the floods began, and many roads and rail lines remain inaccessible, raising fears the death toll will climb.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is still a pile of cars in the industrial estate, mountains and mountains of cars," Amparo Fort, mayor of the town of Chiva, told public radio RNE.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many must be empty, but we are sure others are occupied," Fort said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to national weather service AEMET, the town west of Valencia city recorded 491 mm of rain in just eight hours on Tuesday – almost equalling a year's worth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government minister Angel Victor Torres on Thursday vowed an uncompromising response to looting, in a sign order was breaking down in some places.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police on Friday said they had arrested 50 people for incidents including theft from cars and a jewellery store.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Valencia region town of Aldaia, Fernando Lozano said he saw thieves grabbing items from an abandoned supermarket as "people are a bit desperate".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until things return to normal and the supermarket opens, it's going to be very bad here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slabs of tarmac from destroyed roads littered fields inundated with murky brown water and mud caked the ground floor of homes in the Valencia region.
  <br>
  <br>
  The courthouse in Valencia city has been converted into a morgue, where health workers wearing smocks carried stretchers covered with white sheets.
  <br>
  <br>
  An army of hundreds of volunteers set off from Valencia on Friday armed with shovels, buckets and shopping trolleys laden with food and nappies to help distressed neighbours in the city's flooded suburbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez hailed "the limitless solidarity and dedication of Spanish society" on X and pledged aid "for as long as it takes."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Valencia regional government urged people not to travel to the worst-affected areas, saying emergency services could not reach them and that roads risked collapsing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of people spent a third night without power or communications and slept in temporary shelters.
  <br>
  <br>
  AEMET placed part of the southern Andalusia region on the highest alert level for torrential rain on Friday and maintained warnings for Valencia, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm that sparked the floods formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for the time of year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But scientists say climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events. (AFP)

    Spain flooding death toll rises to 158

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain mourned at least 158 deaths on Friday as authorities told people in flood-stricken regions to stay at home.
 <br>
  <br>
  An exceptionally powerful Mediterranean storm from Tuesday unleashed heavy rains and torrents of mud-filled water that swept away people and wrecked homes, with the eastern Valencia region hit hardest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body coordinating rescue work in Valencia announced 155 bodies had been recovered there by Thursday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia had announced a combined three deaths in their regions on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But "dozens and dozens" of people remain missing two days after the start of the catastrophe, government minister Angel Victor Torres told reporters, raising fears the death toll could rise further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some rural areas also remain inaccessible to rescuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Please, stay at home... follow the calls of the emergency services," pleaded Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
  <br>
  <br>
  European officials pointed on Thursday to the floods in Spain as a reminder of the self-harming effects of humans' destruction of nature, urging delegates at a deadlocked UN biodiversity conference in Colombia to "act."
  <br>
  <br>
  European Commission envoy Florika Fink-Hooijer said the "catastrophe" in the Valencia region highlighted the link between biodiversity loss and human-caused climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Worsening droughts and flooding cause the loss of plant species such as trees -- which serve as a bulwark against some of the worst effects of global warming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we act on biodiversity, we at least can buffer some of the climate impacts," Fink-Hooijer said at a press conference in the city of Cali, host of the 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) to the UN's Convention on Biodiversity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this COP we really have a chance to act," said the envoy, who is also the European Commission director-general for environment. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU launched a formal investigation on Thursday into Chinese-founded e-commerce platform Temu on suspicion the site is doing too little to stop the sale of illegal products, in a probe that could lead to large fines.
 <br>
  <br>
  Extremely popular in the European Union despite having entered the continent's market only last year, Temu has on average around 92 million monthly active users in the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation will also look at dangers from the platform's "potentially addictive design" that could have "negative consequences" on users' "physical and mental well-being," said the European Commission, the EU's powerful digital watchdog.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe is being launched under a mammoth law known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) that forces the world's largest tech firms to do more to protect European consumers online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to ensure that Temu is complying with the Digital Services Act. Particularly in ensuring that products sold on their platform meet EU standards and do not harm consumers," EU tech chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU wants to know more about the systems Temu has in place to "limit the sale" of illegal products as well as how the platform restricts their "reappearance".
  <br>
  <br>
  Temu will also have to explain what measures it is taking to address any risks from its service, including game-like reward programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temu said it would cooperate with the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Temu takes its obligations under the DSA seriously, continuously investing to strengthen our compliance system and safeguard consumer interests on our platform," a Temu spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will cooperate fully with regulators to support our shared goal of a safe, trusted marketplace for consumers," the spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU probe will also look at Temu's systems and how they recommend content and products to users as well as whether the platform is complying with the obligation to give researchers access to Temu's publicly available data, the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temu will also have to provide more details about the "parameters" of its recommender systems, which are used by platforms to push more personalised content.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU stressed that the "opening of formal proceedings does not prejudge its outcome" and there is no deadline for the probe's completion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temu is among 25 "very large" online platforms that must comply with the DSA or risk fines that could reach as high as six percent of their global turnover, or even a ban for serious and repeated violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other shopping platforms that must comply with the DSA include Chinese online retailer AliExpress, US giant Amazon and Chinese-founded Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other DSA investigations have targeted AliExpress, social media platform X, which is owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk and used to be called Twitter, as well as Facebook and Instagram owned by Meta. (AFP)

    EU greenhouse emissions fell in 2023 says EEA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by eight percent in 2023 but the cuts being made are falling short of EU targets, the European Environment Agency (EEA) reported on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Following this "largest year-on-year reduction in several decades," emissions were now 37 percent below 1990 levels, the EEA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The huge drop was led by a significant decline in coal use and growth of renewable energy sources and supported by reduced energy consumption across Europe," said an agency statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The share of renewable energy in Europe's energy consumption has risen from 10.2 percent in 2005 to 24 percent in 2023, the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on existing measures, projections signal a 43 percent reduction in net emissions in EU countries by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, falling short of the 55 percent target set by the EU, the agency warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that "22 member states have submitted additional projections that include planned but not yet launched measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together, these would reduce net emissions in the EU by 49 percent below 1990 levels in 2030," the EEA said, coming closer but still falling short of the target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To close the remaining gap by 2030, it is essential that emissions reductions continue at a swift pace over the coming years," the EEA said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of Japan warned on Thursday of "high uncertainties" following the ruling party's worst election result in 15 years, as it kept interest rates unchanged.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition lost its majority in Sunday's snap vote, likely forcing him to head a minority government with support from other parties to pass legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Businesses and economists worry that as concessions to other parties, Ishiba, 67, will offer tax cuts and higher spending, and go slow on reforms needed to improve Japan's competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are also concerns that the government may pressure the BoJ to take a break from the gradual normalisation begun this year of its ultra-loose monetary policy, even if it leads to a weaker yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the opposition Democratic Party for the People (DPP) – which Ishiba has been courting for support – on Tuesday urged the BoJ "to avoid making big policy changes now".
  <br>
  <br>
  For a long time, the BoJ was an outlier among major central banks, sticking to its ultra-loose policy to spur inflation after the "lost decades" of stagnant or falling prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoJ ditched negative rates in March, lifting borrowing costs for the first time since 2007 and then again in July – signalling more was to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoJ on Thursday kept its main short-term policy rate at 0.25 percent, as widely expected, warning of "high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices".
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank also said it was paying "due attention" to other economies, particularly the United States ahead of presidential elections on November 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoJ again signalled that it would raise borrowing costs if inflation develops as it expects, saying the Japanese economy "is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate".
  <br>
  <br>
  The central bank said it expected inflation of 2.5 percent for the current fiscal year to March 2025 before moderating to two percent in the following two years. (AFP)

    N Korea fires 'long-range' ballistic missile: Seoul

<img alt="The launch came just hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776947_1_20241031075514.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea on Thursday fired a "long-range ballistic missile", South Korea's military said, Pyongyang's first weapons test since Seoul accused it of sending tens of thousands of soldiers to Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's military had warned a day earlier that the nuclear-armed North was preparing to test another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) or even conduct a nuclear test, possibly ahead of next week's US elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our military detected one ballistic missile launched from the Pyongyang area toward the East Sea at approximately 7:10 AM (2210 GMT) today," Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ballistic missile is presumed to be a long-range missile launched at a high angle," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea typically test-fires its longest-range and most powerful missiles on a so-called lofted trajectory – fired up, not out – which it says is to avoid overflying neighbouring countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our military has heightened its alert level and is closely sharing information regarding North Korea's ballistic missile with the US and Japan authorities, maintaining a thorough readiness posture," Seoul's JCS added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo also confirmed a possible launch, with Japan's coastguard reporting an "object potentially a ballistic missile launched from North Korea" and warning vessels to take care.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launch came just hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia, where Washington says some 10,000 have been deployed for possible action against Ukrainian forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence chiefs of South Korea and the United States condemned North Korea's troop deployment to Russia in the "strongest" terms at the allies' annual defence talks at the Pentagon on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul has previously said the nuclear-armed North's accelerating deployment posed a "significant security threat," with the military telling lawmakers on Wednesday that thousands of troops had been moved to western Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that such a large number of personnel has moved westward suggests they are unlikely to have gone merely for observation," a presidential official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul, a major weapons exporter, has said it is reviewing whether to send weapons directly to Ukraine in response, something it has previously resisted due to longstanding domestic policy that prevents it from providing weaponry into active conflicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul has long accused the nuclear-armed North of sending weapons to help Moscow fight Kyiv and alleged that Pyongyang has moved to deploy soldiers en mass in the wake of Kim Jong-un's signing of a mutual defence deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea has denied sending troops, but in the first comment in state media last week, its vice foreign minister said that if such a deployment to happen, it would be in line with international law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pyongyang is banned from tests using ballistic technology by multiple rounds of UN sanctions, but Kim Jong-un has ramped up testing this year, with experts warning he could be testing weaponry before providing it to Russia. (AFP)

    UK to raise taxes by 40 billion pounds annually

<img alt="Rachel Reeves announces a string of tax increases, as she seeks to uphold her new rule get day-to-day spending back into balance by the end of the decade. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776929_1_20241031012156.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's new finance minister Rachel Reeves announced the biggest tax increases in three decades in her first budget on Wednesday, accusing the former Conservative government of breaking the country's public services.
 <br>
  <br>
  Businesses and the wealthy were set to bear the brunt of the tax hikes, and Reeves also paved the way for higher borrowing for investment to speed up Britain's economy, which has been slowed by the 2007-09 global financial crisis, Brexit, Covid and soaring energy prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Bank of England economist – who said she was proud to be the first female Chancellor of the Exchequer – stressed there would be no repeat of how former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss sent the bond market into a tailspin in 2022 with her unfunded tax cut plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Initial reaction to her speech suggested investors were unfazed by the Labour Party's first economic programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  But government prices fell later as the scale of the planned spending became apparent and investors scaled back their bets on Bank of England interest rate cuts next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves said she would raise taxes by 40 billion pounds (US$52 billion) a year, blaming the Conservatives for leaving her Labour Party with a budget "black hole".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any responsible Chancellor would take action," she said. "That is why today, I am restoring stability to our public finances and rebuilding our public services." She painted a grim picture of Britain, with record waiting times in the health service, children studying in crumbling schools and dysfunctional transport and justice systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank, tax hikes of 40 billion pounds would be equivalent to 1.25 percent of economic output, surpassed in recent history only in 1993 by a budget plan under the Conservatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer had warned "those with the broadest shoulders" would have to pay more to spare "working people."
  <br>
  <br>
  The yield on 10-year British government bonds – which moves in the opposite direction to prices – was up by around four basis points on the day at 1600 GMT, having fallen sharply during Reeves' speech earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were pricing in fewer interest rate cuts by the BoE given the scale of government spending with four quarter-point reductions expected in 2025 compared with about five earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves announced a string of tax increases, saying "difficult decisions cannot be constantly delayed or deferred" as she sought to uphold her new rule get day-to-day spending back into balance by the end of the decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rate of social security contributions paid by employers will rise by 1.2 percentage points to 15 percent from April, and a threshold at which firms start to pay it will come down, raising an extra 25 billion pounds a year in five years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other revenue-raising moves included changes to taxes on capital gains and inheritances and tax paid by private equity executives, non-domiciled residents and users of private jets and private schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Reeves unexpectedly ruled out making more individuals pay basic and higher income tax rates after a freeze on the threshold for payments expires in the 2028/29 tax year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also extended a freeze on fuel duty and cut a tax on draught beer in pubs, measures that could help to reverse a fall in support for Starmer's fledgling government in opinion polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another significant move, Reeves said she would change a second fiscal rule to allow for more borrowing, paving the way for 100 billion pounds in investment over the next five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves said the government will now target a fall in public sector net financial liabilities as a share of the economy, rather than public sector net debt excluding the BoE. (Reuters)

    Scientists recreate face of woman buried as a vampire

<div class="itemFullText">
 Buried with a padlock on her foot and an iron sickle across her neck, "Zosia" was never supposed to be able to come back from the dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Entombed in an unmarked cemetery in Pien, northern Poland, the young woman was one of dozens feared by her neighbours to have been a "vampire".
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, using DNA, 3D printing and modelling clay, a team of scientists has reconstructed Zosia's 400-year-old face, revealing the human story buried by supernatural beliefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really ironic, in a way," said Swedish archaeologist Oscar Nilsson. "These people burying her, they did everything they could in order to prevent her from coming back from the dead... we have done everything we can in order to bring her back to life."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zosia, as she was named by locals, was found in 2022 by a team of archaeologists from Torun's Nicolaus Copernicus University.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aged 18-20 when she died, analysis of Zosia's skull suggests she suffered from a health condition which would have caused fainting and severe headaches, as well as possible mental health issues, Nilsson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sickle, the padlock and certain types of wood found at the grave site were all believed at the time to hold magical properties protecting against vampires, according to the Nicolaus Copernicus team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zosia's was Grave No. 75 at the unmarked cemetery in Pien, outside the northern city of Bydgoszcz. Among the other bodies found at the site was a "vampire" child, buried face down and similarly padlocked at the foot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Little is known of Zosia's life, but Nilsson and the Pien team say items she was buried with point to her being from a wealthy — possibly noble — family.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 17th century Europe she lived in was ravaged by war, something Nilsson suggests created a climate of fear in which belief in supernatural monsters was commonplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nilsson's recreation began with creating a 3D printed replica of the skull, before gradually building layers of plasticine clay "muscle by muscle" to form a life-like face.
  <br>
  <br>
  He uses bone structure combined with information on gender, age, ethnicity and approximate weight to estimate the depth of facial features.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's emotional to watch a face coming back from the dead, especially when you know the story about this young girl," Nilsson says.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nilsson said he wanted to bring Zosia back "as a human, and not as this monster that she is buried as". (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain braced for a heavier human toll after at least 95 people died in flash floods that launched muddy waters through towns, tossed cars and wreaked transport havoc.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers were expected to find more bodies in the European country's deadliest flood in more than 50 years and three days of official mourning were due to start on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Television pictures from the town of Utiel showed rescuers using dinghies worked in the dark to scour the floodwaters and taking several people to safety. Emergency services were still working to reach the worst-hit areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those who at this moment are still looking for their loved ones, the whole of Spain weeps with you," Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address, vowing to "rebuild your streets, your squares, your bridges".
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlos Mazon, the regional leader of Valencia, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of citrus production in the world's top orange supplier, said some people remained isolated in inaccessible locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If (emergency services) have not arrived, it's not due to a lack of means or predisposition, but a problem of access," Mazon told a press conference, adding that reaching certain areas was "absolutely impossible".
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 62 people died in Valencia, while authorities in the central region of Castilla La Mancha said the storm had left two people dead and several missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of videos shared on social media overnight appeared to show people trapped by the floodwaters, with some climbing into trees to avoid being swept away. Footage showed rescue workers carrying several women in a bulldozer's bucket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trains to the cities of Madrid and Barcelona were cancelled due to the flooding, and schools and other essential services were suspended in the worst-hit areas, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency services in the region urged citizens to avoid all road travel and to follow further official advice, and a military unit specialised in rescue operations was deployed in some places to help local emergency workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some parts of the region such as the towns of Turis, Chiva or Bunol recorded more than 400 millimetres of rainfall - equivalent to a year of normal rainfall - leading the state weather agency AEMET to declare a red alert on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As rain eased there, the alert was lowered to amber, but with the storm moving in a northeasterly direction, the regional weather service in Catalonia issued a red alert for the area around Barcelona, warning of high winds and hail.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will likely rise with other regions yet to report victims and search efforts continuing in areas with difficult access.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming more frequent in Europe due to climate change. Meteorologists think the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Wednesday said they firmly opposed new rules announced by the US Treasury that will prohibit US-headquartered firms, citizens, and permanent residents from engaging in transactions involving cutting-edge technology with China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The restrictions will take effect on January 2, targeting investments in the fields of semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China firmly opposes the United States issuing final rules on investment restrictions on China and has lodged stern representations with the United States," a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States has generalised the concept of national security," the statement said, calling the restrictions a "typical non-market practice".
  <br>
  <br>
  The rules will "damage the interests" of firms in both China and the United States, the statement warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  China "reserves the right to take measures", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury assistant secretary for investment security Paul Rosen had said in a statement that the areas targeted by the latest US curbs "are fundamental to the development of the next generation of military, surveillance, intelligence and certain cybersecurity applications".
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors will also be required under the rules to inform authorities about investments in some less advanced technologies that could threaten US national security, the department added. (AFP)

 Kamala Harris warned against Donald Trump's bid to seize "unchecked power" in a fiery speech on Tuesday at the spot where her rival riled up a mob before the deadly January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But America, I am here tonight to say: that's not who we are," Harris told a huge crowd of flag-waving supporters against the imposing backdrop of the White House in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The campaign claimed 75,000 people attended the rally, which comes just a week before the current Democratic vice president faces the Republican former president in the closest and most volatile election of modern times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number could not be immediately verified, but the crowd was unusually big in an election that has already seen heavy enthusiasm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The choice of the Ellipse – a park linking the White House to the vast National Mall – was a direct attempt by her campaign to remind voters of the chaos caused by Trump's attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump urged supporters in a speech there to "fight like hell," many then marched on the Capitol to disrupt the certification of Biden's victory, in an assault that left 140 police officers wounded and shocked the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The choice of venue – the White House lit up against the night in the background – was also a symbolic pitch to show Harris ready for the presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking from behind bulletproof screens next to blue signs saying "Freedom," Harris pledged to be a "president for all Americans" – unlike Trump, whom she accused of wanting to jail his enemies.
  <br>
  <br>
  And although her speech began with the dramatic put-down of Trump's behavior, she soon pivoted to a recap of her detailed plans to help financially struggling middle class Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  She got one of the biggest cheers when she referred to Republicans' drive to curtail abortion, saying the government should not be "telling women what to do with their bodies."
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd extended far beyond the Ellipse, across the Mall and all the way up to the iconic Washington Monument obelisk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although there is almost a week to go, the Harris campaign cast the speech as a "closing argument" – a nod to her career as a prosecutor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think of this as a cleansing for what happened on January 6," said Mitzi Maxwell, 69, who came from Florida with her mother to see "all the love and passion and excitement that she (Harris) has become known for."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some Harris supporters queued for more than seven hours before the speech, whose sheer scale and energy was a direct challenge to Trump, a politician who has always boasted about his ability to draw crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Harris spoke in Washington, Trump visited a heavily Hispanic city in Pennsylvania, two days after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's comments about Puerto Rico drew outrage at the New York rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Puerto Ricans are the largest Hispanic group in Pennsylvania, the most crucial battleground state to win as it holds the highest number of Electoral College votes of the seven battleground states, according to the Census Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’d like to begin with a very, very simple question: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans," Trump said. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel faced an international backlash on Tuesday after its parliament approved a bill banning the main United Nations aid agency for the devastated Gaza Strip.
 <br>
  <br>
  Despite global concerns, including from Israel's ally the United States, lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to ban the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) from working in Israel and annexed east Jerusalem.
  <br>
  <br>
  UNRWA has been operating in the Palestinian territories for more than seven decades, and is the largest aid provider in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel controls all humanitarian aid shipments to Gaza, where its forces have been fighting Palestinian militant group Hamas for more than a year. It is unclear how the agency will continue to operate there, and aid groups have warned that there is no immediate replacement for UNRWA.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmakers also passed a measure prohibiting Israeli officials from working with UNRWA and its employees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel says UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas and that the militant group siphons off aid and uses UN facilities to shield its activities, allegations denied by the UN agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a deep connection between the terrorist organisation (Hamas) and UNRWA, and Israel cannot put up with it," lawmaker Yuli Edelstein said in parliament as he presented the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several of Israel's Western allies voiced disquiet at the ban, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying Britain was "gravely concerned."
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany, which has been a staunch defender of Israel's security, warned it would "effectively make UNRWA's work in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem impossible... jeopardising vital humanitarian aid for millions of people."
  <br>
  <br>
  James Elder, a spokesperson for the UN children's agency UNICEF, said the suspension of UNRWA's work “would likely see the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said UNICEF “would become effectively unable to distribute lifesaving supplies" such as vaccines, winter clothes, hygiene kits, health kits, water, and ready-to-use therapeutic food to combat malnutrition.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres said the Israeli law could have "devastating consequences" if implemented, while UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini warned that the vote "sets a dangerous precedent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on social media that Israel was "ready" to continue providing aid to Gaza "in a way that does not threaten Israel's security."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban comes as fighting rages in Gaza and Lebanon, where a second full-scale front opened last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. Around 90 percent of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced from their homes, often multiple times. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Democratic presidential candidate and US Vice President Kamala Harris will urge Americans to turn the page on Donald Trump as she delivers her closing election argument on Tuesday on the spot where her Republican rival rallied supporters before the January 6, 2021 US Capitol attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  With polls in a dead heat one week before Election Day, Harris’ campaign said she chose the symbolic site to push her case that the Republican former president is a threat to American democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said in a statement that the former prosecutor would deliver a "major closing argument" and "make the case that it is time to turn the page on Trump and chart a new way forward.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior campaign official said Harris will also deliver an "optimistic and hopeful" message, amid rumblings in the party that she is focusing too much on Trump and not enough on her own policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris will address some 20,000 people on the Ellipse, a park outside the White House where Trump delivered a fiery speech in which he ramped up his false claims that he won the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump supporters then marched on the Capitol to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's victory, in an assault that left at least five people dead and 140 police officers injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Trump, who, at 78, is the oldest presidential candidate in US history, will be trying to take the sting out of Harris' big event by delivering remarks at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will then rally in blue-collar Allentown in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most crucial of the seven battleground states that are expected to decide the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump gave his closing arguments at a mass rally at New York's Madison Square Garden at the weekend, where some of the other speakers used language widely condemned as racist and sexist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both candidates will keep up a punishing schedule in the final days until November 5, sometimes hitting three or more states in one day. (AFP)

<img alt="Moscow says it has seized the war-battered mining town of Selydove in Donetsk region, and that it had also wrested control of nearby villages there. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776760_1_20241030001806.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato and South Korea have expressed alarm that North Korean troops could soon be joining Moscow's side in the Ukraine-Russia war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nato said on Monday thousands of North Korean troops were moving toward the front line, a development which has prompted Kyiv to call for more weapons and an international plan to keep those troops at bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Western leaders said North Korea has sent some 10,000 soldiers – up from an estimate of 3,000 troops last Wednesday – to help Russia’s military campaign, and warned that its involvement in a European war could also unsettle relations in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had talked with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and told him that 3,000 North Korean soldiers are already at military bases close to the Ukranian front line, and that he expects that deployment to increase to 12,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This war is becoming internationalised, extending beyond two countries," Zelenskiy said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agreed to strengthen intelligence and expertise exchange, intensify contacts at all levels, especially the highest, in order to develop an action strategy and countermeasures to address this escalation," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon told Zelensky that if North Korea receives aid from Russia and is able to glean military experience and knowledge from its involvement in the war, it would pose a "great threat" to South Korea's security, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has said it may start supplying weapons to Ukraine if North Korean troops joined Russia's war. Neither Putin nor Pyongyang has denied North Korean troops are in Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Moscow said on Tuesday it had seized the war-battered mining town of Selydove in eastern Ukraine where Kyiv's forces are buckling.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow also said it had wrested control of the nearby villages of Bogoyavlenka, Girnyk and Katerynivka, also in the Donetsk region, which Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed was formally part of Russia in late 2022, the year Moscow started the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains announced by Moscow on Tuesday are just the latest in a string of Russian advances that have gained momentum since February with the collapse of Ukraine's defences in the stronghold town of Avdiivka.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui arrived in Russia's far east on Tuesday on her way to Moscow, Russian state media said. Russian state news agencies said it was not clear who Choe, making her second visit in six weeks, would meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had no plans to meet her. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany and the European Union on Tuesday strongly condemned Iran's execution of a 69-year-old German-Iranian dissident after years behind bars and warned they were considering retaliatory measures.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Jamshid Sharmahd's execution on Monday a "scandal" and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned Iran's "inhumane regime" of "serious consequences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi doubled down and poured scorn on her comments, writing on X that "a German passport does not provide impunity to anyone, let alone a terrorist criminal".
  <br>
  <br>
  Berlin summoned Iran's charge d'affaires to "convey its strong protest" at the execution. The German ambassador in Tehran also protested to the Iranian foreign ministry and was then recalled to Berlin for consultations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berlin "reserved the right to take further measures", the foreign ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said the bloc condemned Sharmahd's "killing in the strongest possible terms" and was also "considering measures in response".
  <br>
  <br>
  A European Commission spokeswoman told reporters that "any measures" could be taken against Iran and that they "have to be discussed with all member states".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharmahd, a German citizen of Iranian descent and a US resident, was a software engineer who had worked and written for an Iranian opposition group's website based abroad that strongly criticised the Islamic republic's leadership.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was seized by Iranian authorities in 2020 while travelling through the United Arab Emirates, according to his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran accused him of having played a role in a deadly 2008 mosque bombing. He was sentenced to death in February 2023 for the capital offence of "corruption on Earth".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Iranian judiciary's Mizan website said on Monday that "the death sentence of Jamshid Sharmahd... was carried out this morning".
  <br>
  <br>
  His family have always vehemently protested his innocence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharmahd's daughter Gazelle said on X she was waiting for the German and US governments to provide "concrete proof" that her father had been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  If so, she said, his body should be brought home "immediately" and the Iranian government should face "severe punishment".
  <br>
  <br>
  A German foreign ministry source said that Baerbock had spoken to Gazelle Sharmahd on Monday "and expressed condolences on behalf of the German government". (AFP)

 The European Commission on Tuesday said it had finalised discussions with Britain on an agreement that would allow both sides to cooperate directly in antitrust investigations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agreement is the first that would allow national competition authorities from EU countries to cooperate directly with a competition authority outside the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement, which comes into force after both the EU and Britain have finalised their ratification procedures, will set out that important antitrust and merger investigations are brought to each other's attention, the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also allow the coordination of investigations when necessary and set out the principles of cooperation, to avoid conflicts between jurisdictions. (Reuters)

    Former Trump advisor Bannon released from jail

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Steve Bannon, a prominent right-wing figure and former senior advisor to Donald Trump, was released from prison early on Tuesday after spending nearly four months behind bars and just a week ahead of the US election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bannon left a federal prison in Connecticut where he was serving time for a contempt of Congress conviction, several US media outlets reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not broken, I'm empowered," the 70-year-old told the New York Times outside the prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bannon was convicted of defying a subpoena to testify before the congressional panel investigating the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  When he entered prison on July 1, he defiantly said he was "proud" to serve time "if it's what it takes to stand up to Joe Biden."
  <br>
  <br>
  Much has changed in US politics since then, with Biden dropping out of the race and Kamala Harris replacing him as the Democratic nominee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bannon played a senior role in Trump's 2016 campaign and later served in the White House as chief strategist, leaving after seven months reportedly due to conflicts with other top staffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though he no longer works officially for ex-president, he has continued to use his influence to get him back in the White House, mainly through his podcast "The War Room."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2020, he was charged with wire fraud and money laundering for taking for personal use millions of dollars contributed by donors for the construction of a border wall with Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  While others were found guilty in the scheme, Trump issued a blanket pardon to Bannon before leaving office in January 2021, leading to the dismissal of the charges against him. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Vatican on Tuesday will publish its first annual report on protecting minors in the Catholic Church, a move requested by Pope Francis amid pressure for more action to tackle clerical child sex abuse.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors said its report will be a "first step towards a process of data gathering and reporting", and will document "where risks remain, and where advances can be found".
  <br>
  <br>
  Pope Francis set up the independent panel of experts in December 2014 amid an avalanche of revelations of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy across the world, and its cover-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the commission has faced strong criticism over its organisation, funding and role, with several high-profile members quitting.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, Francis incorporated the commission into the Roman Curia – the government of the Holy See – and asked for an annual, "reliable account on what is presently being done and what needs to change".
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of these will be published on Tuesday, launched at the Vatican by the commission's president, US Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the former archbishop of Boston who has spent decades listening to abuse survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement ahead of the launch, the commission described the report as a "new tool", part of a process to set out clear standards on protecting children and vulnerable adults.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be divided into four areas – a review of safeguarding policies in 15 to 20 local churches each year, trends across continents, policies within the Vatican and the Church's broader role in society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It collects resources and practices to be shared across the Universal Church, and makes specific recommendations to promote further progress in safeguarding," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since becoming pope in March 2013, Francis has taken numerous measures to tackle abuse, from opening up internal Church documents to punishing high-ranking clergy, while making it compulsory to report suspicions of sexual assault to Church authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But clergy are still not required to report abuse to civil authorities, unless the laws of that country require it, while any revelations made in confession remain private. (AFP)

    Philadelphia prosecutor sues Musk group over giveaways

<img alt="Election law experts say Elon Musk's giveaway may violate US federal law. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776613_1_20241029032140.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The district attorney of Philadelphia said on Monday that he has filed a lawsuit to halt Elon Musk's US$1 million giveaways as part of his political organisation's effort boosting Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suit by Democratic District Attorney Larry Krasner is the first legal action to be brought over the sweepstakes offering US$1 million every day until November 5 to a person in a battleground state who has signed a petition supporting the Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Krasner's office said the lawsuit, coming just over a week before Election Day, doesn't preclude potential criminal action.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Philadelphia District Attorney is charged with protecting the public from public nuisances and unfair trade practices, including illegal lotteries. The DA is also charged with protecting the public from interference with the integrity of elections,” Krasner's office said in a statement published on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the billionaire tech mogul's America PAC (political action committee), emailed for comment on the lawsuit and asked if the cash awards would continue, responded with a link to an X post, which showed the latest US$1 million winner holding an oversized check.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in Delaware after casting his ballot Monday, US President Joe Biden called the giveaway “totally inappropriate.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk's giveaway requires entrants to sign a petition backing the First and Second Amendments of the Constitution and calls for them to serve as spokespeople for the organization as a condition of winning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The awards have carried on after election law experts raised questions that it violates federal law barring anyone from paying a person to vote or register to vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his statement announcing the lawsuit, Krasner characterised the US$1 million prize as a “lottery,” which would make it more heavily regulated than if it were a prize or work-related. (AP)

    Thousands protest in Georgia after disputed vote

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of Georgians massed outside parliament on Monday night, demanding the annulment of the weekend parliamentary election that the president denounced as rigged with the help of Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rally deepened the political crisis in the South Caucasus country, where the governing Georgian Dream party has become increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You did not lose the election,” President Salome Zourabichvili told the demonstrators who waved Georgian and European Union flags. “They stole your vote and tried to steal your future, but no one has the right to do that and you will not let anyone do that!”
  <br>
  <br>
  Giorgi Vashadze, leader of United National Movement coalition, said the opposition won't take part in any talks with the government and push for a new vote under international supervision.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are not going to enter this parliament. We refuse all mandates,” he said. “We are not going to enter into any negotiations. We are going to fight until victory and we promise you, we will definitely win together.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Natia Chachava, who was wrapped in the Georgian flag, said the demonstrators “don’t want Russia, we don’t want to back to Russia or back to the Soviet Union.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU, the United States and NATO have all called for a full investigation of alleged irregularities in the Georgian election on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georgian Dream and the electoral commission said the vote was free and fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Central Election Commission said the Georgian Dream party received 54.8 percent of the vote with almost all ballots counted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin on Monday denied any Russian interference in the vote, saying it was the West, not Moscow, that was trying to destabilise the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We aren’t meddling in Georgia’s internal affairs, and we have no intention of meddling,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He countered that it was the West that had tried to influence the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament speaker Shalva Papuashvili, a member of Georgian Dream, accused the president of creating “a coup scenario” that goes “against the constitutional order and democratic elections.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely because of a Russian-style “foreign influence law” passed in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many Georgians viewed Saturday’s vote as a pivotal referendum on the opportunity to join the EU. (Agencies)

    Starmer takes on critics as tax rises loom

<img alt="Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaks during an event in Birmingham. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776600_1_20241028220117.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said taxes needed to rise to rebuild public services and fix the foundations of the economy, and challenged critics to spell out how they would tackle the country's "unprecedented" problems.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, finance minister Rachel Reeves will set out her first tax and spending plans which must address a difficult fiscal picture without raising major taxes on workers, cutting spending in priority departments or spooking investors with excessive borrowing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer, whose Labour Party won a landslide election victory in July, said in a speech on Monday that tough trade-offs were needed to "fix the foundations" of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to be realistic about where we are as a country... These are unprecedented circumstances," he said, noting his government, unlike its predecessors in 1997 and 2010, had to deal with both a weak economy and poor public services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I won't offer it as an excuse. I expect to be judged on my ability to deal with this," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour would borrow to drive growth and increase taxes to "prevent austerity and rebuild public services", he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is looking to find around 40 billion pounds in tax rises and spending cuts to address the fiscal gap while putting more money into areas like health and education.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said he rejected the "fiction you can lower taxes (and) spend more on public services without making any changes".
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after the election, Reeves said the fiscal situation was worse than thought due to a 22 billion-pound (US$28.5 billion) black hole she said she had inherited from the previous Conservative government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves has said she will change the definition of public debt in the government's fiscal rules to allow it to borrow more to invest in the hope of speeding up economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to move to a situation where we invest in the future of this country," Starmer said. "I do not accept the proposition that it will have an impact on interest rates."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 240 million pounds would be spent on helping people back into work, and a two pound cap on bus fares would be replaced by a three pound cap next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of the build-up to the budget has been dominated by a debate over the definition of "working people".
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has pledged not to raise social security contributions paid by employees, but critics say working people might still bear the cost if the government increases the contributions paid by employers instead, or raises taxes on their savings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said he was prepared to have a debate about the definition of working people but his chief concern was that there was "no more tax in their payslip."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Conservatives have challenged the new government's assessment of the public finances, saying they are a pretext for tax rises that Labour had been planning already. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The social media network X on Monday suspended an account that published Hebrew-language messages on behalf of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, just days after it was opened.
 <br>
  <br>
  The account had a short notice reading "X suspends accounts which violate the X Rules," though the Elon Musk-owned platform did not specify which rule had been violated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khamenei's office runs several social network accounts in his name, broadcasting messages in different languages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hebrew-language account had launched on the weekend with a message that is a common greeting in the Islamic world: "In the name of Allah, the Benevolent, the Most Merciful."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was opened after Israel carried out air strikes against military sites in Iran on Saturday in response to Tehran's missile attack on October 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least four Iranian soldiers were killed in the attack which Iran said caused "limited damage" to a few radar systems. (AFP)

<img alt="The actor is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's version of the #MeToo movement. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776597_1_20241028213234.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The trial of French actor Gerard Depardieu on sexual assault charges opened on Monday in the absence of the celebrity, who had declared himself to be ill.
 <br>
  <br>
  His lawyer, Jeremie Assous, had said earlier that Depardieu, 75, was "extremely affected" by ill health, and that he had asked for proceedings to be delayed until he could attend in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately his doctors have forbidden him from appearing here today," the lawyer said on arrival for the trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said would ask the court for a six-month suspension of the trial, which comes after numerous other complaints and with a possible second court case already lying in wait.
  <br>
  <br>
  The actor is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's version of the #MeToo movement, triggered in 2017 by allegations against US producer Harvey Weinstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu faces charges of abuse that allegedly occurred during a 2021 film shoot. The names of the two women accusing him have not been made public.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the plaintiffs, a set dresser now aged 55, reported in February that she had suffered sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults while filming director Jean Becker's "Les Volet Verts" ("The Green Shutters") in a private house in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I expect the justice system to be the same for everybody and for monsieur Depardieu not to receive special treatment just because he's an artist," the plaintiff's lawyer Carine Durrieu-Diebolt told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assous said that Depardieu's defence would offer "witnesses and evidence that will show he has simply been targeted by false accusations".
  <br>
  <br>
  He accused the plaintiff of attempting to "make money" by claiming 30,000 euros (US$32,500) in compensation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plaintiff told French investigative website Mediapart that Depardieu had started loudly calling for a cooling fan during the shoot because he "couldn't even get it up" in the heat.
  <br>
  <br>
  She claimed the actor went on to boast that he could "give women an orgasm without touching them".
  <br>
  <br>
  The plaintiff alleged that an hour later she was "brutally grabbed" by Depardieu as she was walking off the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The actor pinned her by "closing his legs" around her before groping her waist and her stomach, continuing up to her breasts, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu made "obscene remarks" during the incident, she said, including: "Come and touch my big parasol. I'll stick it in your pussy."
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the actor's bodyguards dragging him away as he shouted: "We'll see each other again, my dear".
  <br>
  <br>
  "My client expects that the justice system will find Gerard Depardieu to be a serial sexual assaulter," Durrieu-Diebolt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second plaintiff in Monday's case, an assistant director on the same film, also alleges sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anouk Grinberg, an actor who appeared in "The Green Shutters", told AFP that Depardieu had used "salacious words... from morning till night".
  <br>
  <br>
  "When producers hired Depardieu to work on a film, they knew they were hiring an assaulter," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grinberg said that in her experience, Depardieu had "always used sexual, smutty language" -- but that his behaviour had become "much, much worse, with permission from his profession, that pays him for it and covers up his offences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 20 women have now accused Depardieu of various sexual offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Actor Charlotte Arnould was the first to file a criminal complaint.
  <br>
  <br>
  A judge has yet to rule on a request from prosecutors in August for Depardieu to stand trial for raping and sexually assaulting her.
  <br>
  <br>
  An investigation is also underway in Paris after a former production assistant accused Depardieu of a 2014 sexual assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  And actor Helene Darras filed a sexual assault complaint that fell foul of the statute of limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spanish writer and journalist Ruth Baza has accused Depardieu of raping her in 1995.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Never, but never, have I abused a woman," Depardieu wrote in an open letter published in conservative daily Le Figaro in October last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks later, President Emmanuel Macron shocked feminists by complaining of a "manhunt" targeting Depardieu, who he called a "towering actor" who "makes France proud".
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron's remarks followed the broadcast by an investigative TV show of a recording of Depardieu making repeated misogynistic and insulting remarks about women.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu is the biggest star to face accusations in French cinema's #MeToo movement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Directors Jacques Doillon and Benoit Jacquot are among the other major figures accused of sexual violence. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A UK judge on Monday jailed far-right agitator Tommy Robinson for 18 months after he admitted committing contempt of court over a long-running libel case involving a Syrian refugee.
 <br>
  <br>
  The sentence is the latest jail term for one of Britain's most prominent anti-Muslim activists, who is blamed for helping fuel anti-immigration riots earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came after Robinson -- whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon -- pleaded guilty earlier on Monday to 10 breaches of a 2021 High Court order.
  <br>
  <br>
  It bars the 41-year-old far-right figurehead from repeating false allegations he had made about the Syrian refugee, who successfully sued him for libel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Handing down the 18-month jail sentence at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London, judge Jeremy Johnson said Robinson's actions were a "planned, deliberate, direct, flagrant breach of the court's orders".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nobody is above the law. Nobody can pick and choose which injunctions they obey and those they do not," the judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is in the interests of the whole community that injunctions are obeyed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Robinson, wearing a grey suit and waistcoat with no tie, was held in custody, as some of his supporters looked on in court.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had turned himself in to police on Friday, after an arrest warrant was issued following his failure to appear for a July court hearing on the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for the Solicitor General, a senior government post advising on legal matters and which pursues such cases, said during the hearing that Robinson had been "thumbing his nose at the court".
  <br>
  <br>
  It accused him of "undermining" the rule of law, including by last year helping to publish a film called "Silenced", which contains the libellous allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film remains pinned to the top of Robinson's profile on the social media site X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former football hooligan, who helped form the now-defunct far-right English Defence League in 2009, had landed himself back in court because of his "principles", his lawyers argued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robinson, who brands himself as a free speech advocate, has previously served time for contempt of court, which is not a crime but can be sanctioned with a jail term.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also has several criminal convictions, including for assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, thousands of his supporters and other protesters marched through central London demanding his release, as well as tougher immigration laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robinson, who has reportedly spent recent months outside the UK, has amassed a large online following built around his vehemently anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant messaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators at anti-immigrant riots which erupted across England and Northern Ireland in late July and early August could be heard chanting his name.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was widely condemned for a stream of social media posts during the week of violence, which was sparked by false rumours that the suspect behind the fatal stabbings of three young girls was a Muslim asylum seeker.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been a familiar sight at far-right rallies over the years, but has seen his profile grow over the last year after his X account was reinstated following billionaire Elon Musk's purchase of the platform. (AFP)

<img alt="Donald Trump and his supporters went on the attack against Harris in their New York campaign event. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776536_2_20241028133227.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said on Sunday that “no one can sit on the sidelines” in this year's presidential election, capping a day of campaigning across the largest city in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We are focused on the future and we are focused on the needs of the American people," Harris said, "as opposed to Donald Trump, who spends full time looking in the mirror focused on himself.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a city recreation centre, the US Vice President singled out young voters, praising them for being “rightly impatient for change," and told the audience that “there is too much at stake” in the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must not wake up the day after the election and have any regret about what we could have done in these next nine days," Harris said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Energising voters in Philadelphia, a traditional Democratic stronghold, is crucial for Harris’ chances of beating Republican presidential candidate Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  If turnout falls short here, she will struggle to overcome her opponent's advantages in the state's rural areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump hosted a rally featuring crude and racist insults at New York’s Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just over a week before Election Day, speakers at the New York rally labelled Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” and called Harris “the devil”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” said Tony Hinchcliffe, a stand-up comic whose set also included lewd and racist comments about Latinos, Jews and Black people, all key constituencies in the election just nine days away.
  <br>
  <br>
  His joke was immediately criticised by Harris’ campaign as it competes with Trump to win over Puerto Rican communities in Pennsylvania and other swing states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Puerto Rican music superstar Bad Bunny backed Harris shortly after Hinchcliffe's appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The normally pugnacious Trump campaign took the rare step of distancing itself from Hinchcliffe. “
  <br>
  <br>
  This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign," senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But other speakers also made incendiary comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s childhood friend David Rem referred to Harris as “the Antichrist” and “the devil" while businessman Grant Cardone told the crowd that Harris' handlers "will destroy our country.” (AP)

    LDP heavyweight resigns after Japan election drubbing

 The election committee chief of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) resigned on Monday after the party suffered its worst result since 2009, a party official said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of a former prime minister, submitted a letter of resignation, the official said, with media reports quoting him as saying he wanted to "take responsibility" for the result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s ruling coalition lost a majority in the 465-seat lower house in a snap parliamentary election held on Sunday, a punishment by voters' outrage over the governing party’s extensive financial scandals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba's LDP remains the top party in Japan's parliament, and a change of government is not expected. But the results create political uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Falling short of a majority makes it difficult for Ishiba to get his party’s policies through parliament, and he may need to find a third coalition partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LDP’s coalition retains a majority in the less powerful upper house.
  <br>
  <br>
  All told, the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held, according to Japanese media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba took office on October 1 and immediately ordered the election in hopes of shoring up support after his predecessor, Fumio Kishida , failed to address public outrage over the LDP’s scandals.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The results so far have been extremely severe, and we take them very seriously," Ishiba told Japan's national NHK television late Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe the voters are telling us to reflect more and become a party that lives up to their expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba said the LDP would still lead a ruling coalition and tackle key policies, compile a planned supplementary budget and pursue political reform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He indicated that his party is open to cooperating with opposition groups if that suits the public's expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda, made huge gains to 148 seats, from its previous 98.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We accomplished our goal of preventing the ruling coalition from a majority, which was a major achievement,” Noda said. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philippines raised a fresh weather alert on Monday, days after more than 100 people were killed by the country’s worst storm of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly a million people are still sheltering at evacuation centres or with relatives after losing their homes or being driven out by floodwaters brought by Severe Tropical Storm Trami, which struck from October 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country's weather agency says Tropical Storm Kong-rey will strengthen into a typhoon by Tuesday and pass close to the northern Philippines as early as Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lowest of a five-stage storm alert is in place on the country's northeast coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trami, by contrast, struck some of the country's most populous areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government's disaster agency put the death toll from Trami at 116, with 39 missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Philippines or its surrounding waters each year, damaging homes and infrastructure and killing dozens of people. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's ruling coalition has lost its majority after snap elections, Japanese media projected early on Monday, in what would be a major blow to new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba, 67, called Sunday's election only days after taking office on October 1, aiming to bolster his position and that of his scandal-hit Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost continuously for seven decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  But national broadcaster NHK and other media outlets reported in the hours after polls closed that the LDP – in the party's worst result since 2009 – together with its long-term junior coalition partner Komeito had fallen short of the 233 seats needed for a majority in Japan's lower house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voters in the world's fourth-largest economy have been rankled by rising prices and the fallout from a party slush fund scandal that helped sink previous premier Fumio Kishida.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LDP remains the top party in Japan's parliament, and a change of government is not expected. But the results create political uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Falling short of a majority makes it difficult for Ishiba to get his party’s policies through parliament, and he may need to find a third coalition partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LDP’s coalition retains a majority in the less powerful upper house. Public broadcaster NHK reported that the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are receiving severe judgement," Ishiba told NHK earlier on Sunday while it was still unclear whether the coalition would secure enough seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voters "expressed their strong desire for the LDP to do some reflection and become a party that will act in line with the people's will," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage from the LDP headquarters showed gloomy faces as projections based on exit polls indicated Ishiba's justice and agriculture ministers were likely to lose their seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda, made huge gains to 148 seats, from its previous 98.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We accomplished our goal of preventing the ruling coalition from a majority, which was a major achievement,” Noda said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noda called the election a rare chance for a change of government, and said he seeks to lead a coalition with other opposition groups to do so. But his party has had trouble finding partners, and some voters were skeptical about the opposition’s ability and inexperience.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Ishiba, potential additional partners include the Democratic Party of the People, which calls for lower taxes, and the conservative Japan Innovation Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  DPP head Yuichiro Tamaki said he was open to “a partial alliance.” Innovation Party chief Nobuyuki Baba has denied any intention to cooperate. As of early Monday, DPP had 28 seats and the Innovation Party 38.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts say a CDPJ-led government is not in the picture because of its lack of viable policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If they take power and try to change the economic and diplomatic policies of the current government, they will only end up collapsing right away,” said Izuru Makihara, a University of Tokyo professor of politics and public policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Realistically, Ishiba's ruling coalition would seek a partnership with either the Innovation Party or the Democratic Party of the People”, he said. (Agencies)

<img alt='Georgian president Salome Zurabishvili has accused Moscow of orchestrating a special operation that resulted in the "total falsification of the election".

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Georgian opposition on Sunday called for protests and the European Union demanded an investigation into "irregularities" after a disputed legislative vote that showed a win for the ruling party.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pro-Western President Salome Zurabishvili accused Moscow of being behind the alleged election fraud, calling it a "Russian special operation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid angry opposition claims over the result, Zurabishvili called for a rally on Monday. Jailed former president Mikheil Saakashvili also called for mass protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union had warned that Saturday's vote could determine Tbilisi's chances of joining the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU council president Charles Michel wrote on X that Georgian authorities should "swiftly, transparently and independently investigate and adjudicate electoral irregularities and allegations thereof.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These alleged irregularities must be seriously clarified and addressed," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After meeting with opposition leaders in Tbilisi, Zurabishvili said there had been a "total falsification of the election".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are witnesses and victims of a Russian special operation, a modern form of hybrid war against the Georgian people," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  International observers said Saturday's election was "marred by an uneven playing field, pressure and tension". An EU parliament mission also expressed concern about "democratic backsliding", saying it had seen instances of "ballot box stuffing" and the "physical assault" of observers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saakashvili said on Facebook that opposition lawmakers should renounce their parliamentary seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time for mass protests. We must show the world that we are fighting for freedom and that we are a people who will not tolerate injustice," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official tallies from more than 99 percent of precincts showed the ruling Georgian Dream party winning 54 percent of the vote, with the main pro-Western opposition coalition on 37.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result gives Georgian Dream 91 seats in the 150-member parliament – enough to govern but short of the supermajority it had sought to pass a constitutional ban on all main opposition parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our victory is impressive," Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said in a statement, accusing the opposition of "undermining the country's constitutional order" by questioning his party's victory. (AFP)
