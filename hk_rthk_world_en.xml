<div class="itemFullText">
 Sectarian feuding in northwest Pakistan killed 13 more people, a local government official said on Saturday, as warring Sunnis and Shi'ites defied repeated ceasefire orders, bringing the total death toll in a recent spasm of violence to 124.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country, but Kurram district – in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the border with Afghanistan – has a large Shi'ite population and the communities have clashed for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh fighting broke out last Thursday when two separate convoys of Shi'ite Muslims travelling under police escort were ambushed, killing more than 40.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then 10 days of fighting with light and heavy weapons has brought the region to a standstill, with major roads closed and mobile phone services cut as the death toll surged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Kurram local government official put the death toll at 124 on Saturday after 13 more people were killed in the past two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two were Sunni and 11 Shi'ite, he said, whilst more than 50 people have been wounded in fresh fighting which continued on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a severe lack of trust between the two sides, and neither tribe is willing to comply with government orders to cease hostilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police report that many people want to flee the area due to the violence, but the deteriorating security situation makes it impossible," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A seven-day ceasefire deal was announced by the provincial government last weekend but failed to hold. Another 10-day truce was brokered on Wednesday but it also failed to stymie the fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior security official in the provincial capital of Peshawar, also speaking anonymously, confirmed the total death toll of 124.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a fear of more fatalities," he said. "None of the provincial government's initiated measures have been fully implemented to restore peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have regularly struggled to control violence in Kurram, which was part of the semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas until it was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 79 people had been killed in the region between July and October in sectarian clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The feuding is generally rekindled by disputes over land in the rugged mountainous region, and fuelled by underlying tensions between the communities adhering to different sects of Islam. (AFP)

<img alt="Children in the town of Pasir Puteh invent new games to pass the time. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781537_1_20241130164746.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 122,000 people have been forced out of their homes as massive floods caused by relentless rains swept through Malaysia's northern states, disaster officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number surpassed the 118,000 displaced during one of the country's worst floodings in 2014, and disaster officials feared it could rise further as there was no let-up in the torrential downpours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll remained at four recorded across Kelantan, Terengganu and Sarawak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kelantan state bore the brunt of the flooding, accounting for 63 percent of the 122,631 people displaced, according to data from the National Disaster Management Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were nearly 35,000 people evacuated in Terengganu, with the rest of the displacements reported from seven other states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy rains, which began early this week, continued to hammer Pasir Puteh town in Kelantan, where people could be seen walking through streets inundated with hip-deep waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My area has been flooded since Wednesday. The water has already reached my house corridor and is just two inches away from coming inside," said Pasir Puteh resident and school janitor Zamrah Majid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Luckily, I moved my two cars to higher ground before the water level rose."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she allowed her grandchildren to play in the water in front of her house because it was still shallow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if the water gets higher, it would be dangerous, I'm afraid they might get swept away," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't received any assistance yet, whether it's welfare or other kinds of help."
  <br>
  <br>
  Muhammad Zulkarnain, 27, who is living with his parents in Pasir Puteh, said they were isolated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no way in or out of for any vehicles to enter my neighbourhood," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I'm scared... Luckily we have received some assistance from NGOs, they gave us food supplies like biscuits, instant noodles, and eggs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of emergency services personnel have been deployed in flood-prone states along with rescue boats, four-wheel-drive vehicles and helicopters, said Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who chairs the National Disaster Management Committee. (AFP)

<img alt="Jihadist fighters keep warm in front of the landmark Aleppo citadel. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781535_1_20241130161818.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A monitor of Syria's war said on Saturday that jihadist rebels now control a majority of Aleppo city, reporting Russian air strikes on parts of Syria's second city for the first time since 2016.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions... took control of most of the city and government centres and prisons," said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, referring to a jihadist alliance led by Al-Qaeda's former Syria branch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrian jihadist rebels have pressed a lightning offensive against forces of the Iranian- and Russian-backed Syrian government since Wednesday, the same day a fragile ceasefire took effect in neighbouring Lebanon between Israel and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah after two months of all-out war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, Russian "warplanes launched raids on areas of Aleppo city for the first time since 2016," added the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  It raised the death toll in days of clashes to 311 – 183 from HTS and allied Turkish-backed factions, 100 soldiers and pro-government forces, as well as 28 civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media reported that four civilians were killed when HTS shelled a student residence in Aleppo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran-backed militias have a heavy presence in the Aleppo region after providing crucial ground support when the Syrian army – backed by Russian air power – recaptured rebel-held areas of the city in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said that "the governor of Aleppo and the police and security branch commanders withdrew from the city centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  The overnight air strikes coincided with "the arrival of large (rebel) military reinforcements" to the area, the Observatory added. (AFP)

    Thailand flooding kills nine, displaces thousands

<div class="itemFullText">
 Flooding driven by heavy rains in southern Thailand has killed nine people and displaced more than 13,000, officials said on Saturday, as rescue teams using boats and jet skis worked to reach stranded residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Local media footage showed residents wading through murky, chest-deep water and cars submerged in flooded streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Flooding across eight provinces in southern Thailand has affected 553,921 households and claimed nine lives, prompting agencies to mobilise urgent assistance," the country's disaster agency said on its official Facebook page.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 13,000 people had been forced to flee their homes, with temporary shelters set up in schools and temples, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nampa, a resident of coastal Songkhla province, told state broadcaster Thai PBS she was concerned about the dwindling food supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are doing fine now, but I am not sure how long can we stay in this condition," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two hospitals in nearby Pattani province suspended operations to prevent floodwaters from damaging medical facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring north Malaysia, the rains have forced the evacuation of at least 80,000 people to temporary shelters this week, with disaster officials there saying at least four people have been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai Meteorological Department has warned that "very heavy rain" could continue to affect some areas of the country's south through next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has deployed rescue teams to assist affected residents and designated 50 million baht (US$1.7 million) in flood relief for each province.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on Friday on social media platform X that the goal was to "restore normalcy as quickly as possible."

    British MPs advance contentious assisted dying law

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK lawmakers voted on Friday in favour of assisted dying for terminally ill people in England and Wales, advancing the emotive and contentious legislation to the next stage of parliamentary scrutiny.
 <br>
  <br>
  MPs voted by 330 to 275 in support of legalised euthanasia in the first vote on the issue in the House of Commons for nearly a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result came following an emotionally-charged debate that lasted almost five hours in a packed and hushed chamber, and as competing protesters made their voices heard outside parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill now progresses to the committee stage where lawmakers can table amendments, a process likely to be vexed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legislation would then face further votes in the Commons and House of Lords upper chamber. The process will likely take months and if it is ultimately passed then a change in the law is expected to be several years away.
  <br>
  <br>
  The House of Commons last debated, and defeated, a euthanasia bill in 2015, but public support for giving terminally ill people the choice to end their lives has since shifted in favour, polls show.
  <br>
  <br>
  A change in the law would see Britain emulate several other countries in Europe and elsewhere that allow some form of assisted dying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who is behind the bill, told the debate that changing the law would give terminally ill people "choice, autonomy and dignity at the end of their lives."
  <br>
  <br>
  Advocates also argue that it would make some deaths less painful.
  <br>
  <br>
  But other MPs expressed concern that people might feel coerced into opting for euthanasia, while some said they were worried it would discriminate against people with disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opponents also worry that the healthcare system is not ready for such a landmark change and that it could cause a decline in investment for palliative care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "True dignity consists in being cared for to the end," Conservative MP Danny Kruger said, urging colleagues to reject a "state suicide service."
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside, dozens of opponents gathered holding signs with "Kill the Bill, not the ill" and "Care not killing," urging MPs to vote against the proposed legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A nearby gathering in favour of the legislation saw people dressed in pink holding placards with slogans such as: "My life, my death, my choice."
  <br>
  <br>
  Assisted suicide currently carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Scotland, which has a separate legal system and devolved powers to set its own health policy, it is not a specific criminal offence. But it can leave a person open to other charges, including murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leadbeater's bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults with an incurable illness who have a life expectancy of fewer than six months and are able to take the substance that causes their death themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any patient's wish to die would have to be signed off by a judge and two doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures are stricter than assisted dying laws in other European countries and also proposed legislation being contemplated in France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consideration is being given to a similar bill in Scotland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leadbeater's initiative is a so-called private members' bill and is not part of the government's agenda, although it follows Prime Minister Keir Starmer's vow, before winning power in July, to allow parliament to revisit the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  MPs had a free vote, meaning predicting the outcome was virtually impossible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer, who voted in favour of permitting assisted suicide in 2015 with "robust" safeguards, did not reveal his view in the run-up to the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  His ministerial team had been instructed to remain neutral but several expressed views, both in support and against.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two polls last week indicated that a majority of Britons back changing the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faith leaders are among the stringent opponents, with nearly 30 signing a joint letter last weekend arguing they are "deeply concerned" by the plans. (AFP)

    Notre Dame unveils its new interior 5 years after fire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than five years of frenetic reconstruction work, Notre Dame Cathedral showed its new self to the world on Friday, with rebuilt soaring ceilings and creamy good-as-new stonework erasing sombre memories of its devastating fire in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Images broadcast live of a site visit by French President Emmanuel Macron showed the inside of the iconic cathedral as worshippers might have experienced it back in medieval times, its wide, open spaces filled with bright light on a crisp and sunny winter’s day that lit up the vibrant colours of the stained glass windows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside, the monument is still a construction site, with scaffolding and cranes. But the renovated interior – shown in its full glory on Friday for the first time before the public is allowed back in on December 8 – proved to be breathtaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gone are the gaping holes that the blaze tore into the vaulted ceilings, leaving charred piles of debris. New stonework has been carefully pieced together to repair and fill the wounds that had left the cathedral's insides exposed to the elements. Delicate golden angels look on from the centrepiece of one of the rebuilt ceilings, seeming to fly again above the transept.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cathedral's bright, cream-coloured limestone walls look brand new, cleaned not only of dust from the fire but also of grime that had accumulated for centuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cathedral attracted millions of worshippers and visitors annually before the April 15, 2019, fire forced its closure and turned the monument in the heart of Paris into a no-go zone except for artisans, architects and others mobilised for the reconstruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron entered via the cathedral’s giant and intricately carved front doors and stared up at the ceilings in wonder. He was accompanied by his wife, Brigitte, the archbishop of Paris and others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powerful vacuum cleaners were used to first remove toxic dust released when the fire melted the cathedral's lead roofs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fine layers of latex were then sprayed onto the surfaces and removed a few days later, taking dirt away with them from the stones' pores, nooks and crevices. In all, 42,000 square metres of stonework were cleaned and decontaminated – an area equivalent to roughly six soccer pitches.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It feels like it was built yesterday, like it’s just been born, even though Notre Dame is very old," said stonemason Adrien Willeme, who worked on the reconstruction. "Because it’s been so carefully restored and cleaned, it looks really extraordinary.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleaning gels were also used on some walls that had been painted, removing many years of accumulated dirt and revealing their bright colours once again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carpenters worked by hand like their medieval counterparts as they hewed giant oak beams to rebuild the roof and spire that collapsed like a flaming spear into the inferno. The beams show the marks of the carpenters' handiwork, with dents made on the woodwork by their hand axes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 2,000 oak trees were felled to rebuild roof frameworks so dense and intricate that they are nicknamed “the forest.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron's visit kicked off a series of events ushering in the reopening of the 12th-century Gothic masterpiece. At the end of his tour, the president addressed hundreds of workers gathered inside the cathedral and thanked them for their labours on what he called the "building site of the century.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The shock of the reopening will, I want to believe, be as powerful as the one of the fire. But it will be a shock of hope,” he said. “The inferno of Notre Dame was a wound for the nation. And you were its remedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron will return on December 7 to deliver another address and will attend the consecration of the new altar during a solemn Mass the following day. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun on Friday fulfilled a promise he made after spending US$6.2 million on an artwork featuring a banana duct-taped to a wall – by eating the fruit.
 <br>
  <br>
  At one of Hong Kong's priciest hotels, Sun chomped down on a banana in front of dozens of journalists and influencers after giving a speech hailing the work as "iconic" and drew parallels between conceptual art and cryptocurrency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's much better than other bananas," Sun said after getting his first taste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really quite good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Titled "Comedian," the conceptual work created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan was sold at a Sotheby's auction in New York last week, with Sun among seven bidders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said he felt "disbelief" in the first 10 seconds after he won the bid, before realising "this could become something big."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 10 seconds after that, he decided he would eat the banana.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Eating it at a press conference can also become a part of the artwork's history," he said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The debut of the edible creation at the 2019 Art Basel show in Miami Beach sparked controversy and raised questions about whether it should be considered art – Cattelan's stated aim.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Sun on Friday compared conceptual art like "Comedian" to NFT art and decentralised blockchain technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of its objects and ideas exist as (intellectual property) and on the internet, as opposed to something physical," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also this week disclosed a US$30 million investment in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project backed by US president-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crypto businessman was last year charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission with offering and selling unregistered securities in relation to his crypto project Tron. The case is ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a function room at the Peninsula hotel in Hong Kong, two men dressed as auction house staff stood in front of a featureless wall with the yellow banana offering the only splash of colour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said he only recently decided to bid for the artwork, adding he had "dumb questions" such as whether the banana had decayed and how to value the work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The artwork owner is given a certificate of authenticity that the work was created by Cattelan as well as instructions about how to replace the fruit when it goes bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event attendees on Friday each received a roll of duct tape and a banana as a souvenir.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone has a banana to eat," he said. (AFP)

    Mexico rules out trade war with US

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump has said the tariffs would remain in effect until the flow of drugs and migrants into the US was controlled. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781280_1_20241128203256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Thursday ruled out a trade war with the United States after speaking with President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened stiff tariffs to halt illegal immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There will not be a potential tariff war," Sheinbaum - who has been scrambling to head off threatened tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican goods - told a daily news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was speaking a day after a telephone call with Trump, who has threatened to slap tariffs on Canada and China in addition to Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their call, Sheinbaum and Trump offered differing accounts of what they had discussed regarding migration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump claimed that Mexico's left-wing president had "agreed to stop migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum later said she had discussed a policy already in place, and denied Trump's version again on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can assure you... that we would never - we would not be capable - of proposing that we were going to close the border," she said, adding: "Of course we do not agree with that."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she had assured the Republican leader that a caravan of migrants assembled in southern Mexico, over which Trump had expressed concern, "will not reach the northern border," pointing to Mexico's "strategy" of preventing such convoys crossing its territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that after that, the talks had no longer revolved around the threat of tariff hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump caused panic among some of the biggest US trading partners on Monday when he said he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican and Canadian imports and 10 percent on goods from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard warned on Wednesday that some 400,000 jobs in the United States could be lost if Trump followed through on his threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a study based on figures from US carmakers that manufacture in Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum said Thursday that further conversations were planned between her government and Trump's transition team before his January 20 inauguration. (AFP)

    Australia passes social media law banning youngsters

<img alt="Australia plans to trial an age-verification system that may include biometrics or government identification. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781285_1_20241128212031.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia passed a law on Thursday to ban social media for children aged under 16 after days of heated debate, setting a standard for other countries to follow in a global push to curb the power of Big Tech.
 <br>
  <br>
  The law, expected to take effect in November 2025, sets some of the toughest social media controls in the world and will force platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a parliamentary session that went into the night, the country's Senate, or upper house of parliament, voted to pass the law after the centre-left Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese won support from the conservative opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate's approval for the law is the final legislative hurdle after the lower house, or House of Representatives, passed the bill on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese, trying to lift his approval ratings ahead of an election expected in May, had argued that social media posed risks to the physical and mental health of children and is looking for support from parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia plans to trial an age-verification system that may include biometrics or government identification to enforce the ban. The trial will run for several months and its findings would be reviewed by mid-2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the law, companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million (US$32 million) for breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  In submissions to parliament, Alphabet's Google and Meta said the ban should be delayed until the age-verification trial finishes, expected in mid-2025. Bytedance's TikTok said the bill needed more consultation, while Elon Musk's X argued the proposed law might hurt children's human rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Senate committee backed the bill this week, but also inserted a condition that social media platforms should not force users to submit personal data such as passport and other digital identification to prove their age. (Reuters)

<img alt="Prosecutors in Berlin have now linked the suspect to four more deaths. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781274_2_20241128204123.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German investigators suspect a Berlin doctor of killing eight elderly patients under his care and setting fire to some of their homes to cover up his crimes, prosecutors said Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unnamed suspect, 40, who worked in palliative care for a nursing service, was remanded in custody in August on suspicion of killing four women aged 72 to 94 and starting fires at their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors in Berlin have now linked the suspect to four more deaths of men and women aged between 61 and 83, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in August said the man was being investigated on four counts of manslaughter, one count of arson and three counts of attempted arson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Berlin prosecutors said they were now treating the alleged killings as murder cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The accused appears to have had no motive for killing the people other than the act of killing itself," they said, accusing him of a "lust for murder".
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in August said the man was suspected of killing four female patients in the care of his nursing service in Berlin between June 11 and July 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, an 87-year-old woman was resuscitated after emergency services arrived, but died later in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another, the suspect allegedly started a blaze but the fire went out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he realised this, he allegedly informed a relative of the woman and claimed that he was standing in front of her flat and that nobody was answering the doorbell," police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the four new cases, which date back to the period from June 2022 to April 2024, the suspect is accused of killing two men and two women in Berlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, he is suspected of administering a cocktail of medications to a 70-year-old female patient in her apartment in Berlin's Tempelhof district and then starting a fire to cover up his crime.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire department, called by a neighbour, was able to prevent the flames from spreading to the rest of the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also accused of administering deadly medications to two men, aged 70 and 83, and to a 61-year-old woman. (AFP)

    EU invites UK prime minister Starmer to defence talks

<img alt="The encounter between Keir Starmer and the EU will be the first of its kind since London's 2020 departure from the bloc. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781265_1_20241128191850.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU will invite British premier Keir Starmer for talks on defence with the bloc's 27 leaders in February, Brussels said Thursday, as the two sides push to rebuild ties after Brexit.
 <br>
  <br>
  A senior European Union official said Brussels intends to organise "informal retreats", starting with a meeting in Belgium on February 3 focused on security issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The encounter would be the first of its kind between the EU and Britain since London's 2020 departure from the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For this one, the idea is to invite the secretary general of NATO and the UK prime minister," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outreach to Starmer is part of efforts to forge better ties after the acrimony caused by Britain's exit from the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British prime minister -- who came to power in July -- made his first visit to Brussels last month to launch the long road to a reset.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of those efforts, he agreed with European Commission chief to start holding regular summits between the two sides from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer's government has mooted reaching a "security pact" with the EU but details so far remain vague on what that would entail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister, who voted in the UK's 2016 Brexit referendum to remain in the EU, has insisted his reset will not mean reversing Brexit, which remains a politically toxic subject in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The February talks on defence will come at a crucial juncture, just after Donald Trump assumes power in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain and the EU have been staunch supporters of Ukraine in its war against Russia and are warily eyeing Trump's promises to end the conflict quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels is currently reshuffling its top leadership, with former Portuguese prime minister Antonio Costa set to replace Belgium's Charles Michel as head of the European Council on Sunday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several members of Donald Trump's incoming administration have received threats including bomb alerts, the FBI said on Wednesday, with one nominee reporting a pipe-bomb scare sent with a pro-Palestinian message.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The FBI is aware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees, and we are working with our law enforcement partners," the agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swatting refers to the practice in which police are summoned urgently to someone's house under false pretenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, earlier said that several appointees and nominees “were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Elise Stefanik, a Trump loyalist congresswoman tapped to be UN ambassador, said her residence in New York was targeted in a bomb threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in a statement that she, her husband, and her three-year-old son were driving home from Washington for the Thanksgiving holiday when they learned of the threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Zeldin, Trump's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said his home was targeted with a pipe bomb threat sent with “a pro-Palestinian themed message.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The former congressman from New York said he and his family were not home at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he prepares to return to the White House in January, Trump has already swiftly assembled a cabinet of loyalists, including several criticised for a severe lack of experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican, who appears set to avoid trial on criminal prosecutions related to attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss, was wounded in the ear in July in an assassination attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has not commented on the apparent bomb threats. (AFP/Reuters)

<img alt="More than 10,000 protesters surged into the city, defying a lockdown and a ban on public gatherings to skirmish with 20,000 security forces. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781120_1_20241127210502.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan police said on Wednesday they had arrested nearly 1,000 protesters who marched on the capital Islamabad demanding the release of jailed ex-prime minister Imran Khan, after crowds were evicted from the city centre in a sweeping security crackdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan has been jailed since August 2023, sidelined by dozens of legal cases he claims were concocted to prevent his comeback in elections this year marred by rigging allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the February vote, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has defied a government crackdown with regular rallies, but Tuesday's gathering was by far the largest to grip the capital since the poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10,000 protesters surged into the city, defying a lockdown and a ban on public gatherings to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Islamabad Police Inspector General Ali Nasir Rizvi said 954 protesters had been arrested between Sunday and Tuesday, when crowds came within 1.6 kilometres of a public square they aimed to occupy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said at least one police officer and four state paramilitary personnel had been killed, before the main thoroughfare was cleared by forces armed with tear gas and batons early on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement that security forces had "bravely repulsed the protesters" as PTI told activists on social media the rally was cancelled "for the time being."
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan made a statement from his cell outside Islamabad calling supporters to the capital on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the crowds were led by his key lieutenant Ali Amin Gandapur and his wife Bushra Bibi, who was also jailed earlier this year but released last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The movement is continuing and it will be ended only by Imran Khan," said Gandapur after retreating from Islamabad to northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where he serves as chief minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called the protests "extremism." Since Sunday, his ministers have held regular press conferences in central Islamabad vowing no mercy for the oncoming marchers. (AFP)

<img alt="Hassan Fadlallah (centre) said there was full cooperation with the Lebanese state. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781121_1_20241127211249.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said on Wednesday his group was cooperating with the army's deployment to southern Lebanon under the terms of a new truce with Israel, insisting "there will be no problem there".
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came as Lebanon's army said it had begun reinforcing its presence in the south, and as tens of thousands of residents streamed home after the sealing of an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire following more than a year of hostilities and two months of all-out war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to an AFP question about Hezbollah fighters' withdrawal north of the Litani River in accordance with the ceasefire deal, Fadlallah said the matter was "linked to Lebanese state measures and strengthening the army presence".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is full cooperation on this issue and there will be no problem there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lebanese military said Wednesday that it had "begun reinforcing its presence in the South Litani sector and extending the state's authority in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)".
  <br>
  <br>
  An AFP journalist saw army troops and vehicles in two areas of south Lebanon on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fadlallah went on to say that Hezbollah had "no visible weapons or bases" in the south, but at the same time, noted the group "is a secret resistance... not a regular army".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hezbollah's people are the people of these villages and towns, and most of the dead are from these villages," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nobody can make residents leave their villages."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon says at least 3,823 people have been killed in the country since exchanges of cross-border fire began in October 2023, most of them in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the army would shore up its presence in the country's south, while urging Israel to withdraw and respect the ceasefire that came into force on Wednesday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s weather agency said the capital, Seoul, was blanketed on Wednesday by the heaviest November snowfall since records began over a century ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The snowstorm grounded hundreds of flights and disrupted commuter traffic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said 20 centimetres of snow fell in northern parts of Seoul and nearby areas, compared to the city's previous record of 12.4 centimetres on November 28, 1972.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap news agency said one person died and four others were injured in a five-vehicle accident in the eastern town of Hongcheon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm blanketed much of the country, with the country’s central, eastern and southwestern regions seeing about 10 to 23 centimetres of snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 220 flights were cancelled or delayed at airports nationwide, while authorities ordered around 90 ferries to remain at port. They also shut down hundreds of hiking trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Icy road conditions slowed down the morning commute in Seoul, while emergency workers across the country responded to fallen trees, signs, and other safety risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather agency said snowfall would continue in most parts of the country until Thursday. (Agencies)

    Aussie social media bill closer to becoming law

<img alt="Australian legislation banning social media for people under 16 is closer to reality after it passed through the country's lower house of Parliament on Wednesday. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781021_1_20241127122816.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia on Wednesday moved closer to banning social media for children under 16 after the parliament's lower house passed the bill even as Alphabet's Google and Facebook-owner Meta pressed the government to delay the legislation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Australia's House of Representatives passed the bill 102 votes to 13 after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's centre-left Labor government secured bipartisan support for the ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate is expected to debate the bill later on Wednesday, with the government keen to ensure it is passed by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With widespread support of the bill, analysts said this all but guarantees the legislation will pass in the Senate, where no party holds a majority of seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it becomes law this week, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restrictions before the penalties are enforced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese, trying to lift his approval ratings ahead of an election expected in May, has argued that excessive use of social media poses risks to the physical and mental health of children and is looking for support from parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The planned law would force social media platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place. Companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million (US$32 million) for systemic breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition lawmaker Dan Tehan told Parliament the government had agreed to accept amendments in the Senate that would bolster privacy protections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver’s licences. The platforms also could not demand digital identification through a government system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Will it be perfect? No. But is any law perfect? No, it’s not. But if it helps, even if it helps in just the smallest of ways, it will make a huge difference to people’s lives,” Tehan told Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some youth advocates including Australia's human rights commission raised concerns the law would hurt children's rights to self-expression, but a YouGov survey released on Tuesday showed 77 percent of Australians backed the ban, up from 61 percent in an August survey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers who were not aligned with either the government or the opposition were most critical of the legislation during the debate on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were criticisms the legislation had been rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents’ authority to decide what’s best for their children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encountered and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Independent lawmaker Zoe Daniel said the legislation would “make zero difference to the harms that are inherent to social media.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The true object of this legislation is not to make social media safe by design, but to make parents and voters feel like the government is doing something about it,” Daniel told Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is a reason why the government parades this legislation as world-leading, that’s because no other country wants to do it,” she added. (Agencies)

    Ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah takes effect

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon took effect on Wednesday, after more than a year of fighting that has killed thousands of people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The truce, which began before dawn, should bring a halt to a war that has forced tens of thousands of people in Israel and hundreds of thousands more in Lebanon to flee their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  An international panel led by the United States will monitor compliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire does not address the war in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's security cabinet approved the US-France-brokered agreement after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented it, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war has seen swathes of Lebanon pounded by air strikes and Israeli troops deployed across the border to battle Hezbollah militants.
  <br>
  <br>
  It began with Hezbollah launching cross-border strikes in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon says at least 3,823 people have been killed in the country since then -- most of them in the past several weeks, when Israel escalated its campaign against Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Israeli side, the hostilities with Hezbollah have killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities say. (Agencies)

    Russia vows response to latest Ukraine ATACMS strikes

<img alt="Russia's defence ministry on Tuesday said Ukraine had carried out fresh strikes. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780941_1_20241126220654.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Moscow's military on Tuesday pledged a response to fresh Ukrainian air attacks inside Russia using US-supplied ATACMS missiles.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine firing the long-range missiles into Russia for the first time last week prompted a furious reaction from Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's defence ministry on Tuesday said Ukraine had carried out fresh strikes on November 23 and 25 using ATACMS.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Retaliatory actions are being prepared," it said in a post on Telegram, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States gave Ukraine permission to use the weapons to hit Russian territory earlier this month after months of requests from Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a rare admission, Russia said the fresh strikes had caused damage to military hardware and wounded some of its personnel on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  A strike on the Kursk Vostochny air base wounded two servicemen, the defence ministry said, while a strike on an air defence battery damaged a radar system and also caused "casualties".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said three of the five missiles fired in the first strike were shot down, while seven of the eight used in the second were destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow rarely provides such specific details on Ukrainian aerial attacks and almost never admits missiles have reached their intended target.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence ministry also posted photos of what it said were the missile fragments, showing large casings with English-language inscriptions on the side.
  <br>
  <br>
  The images could not be immediately verified.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes come with tensions having ratcheted up dramatically in the near three-year conflict over the last few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin last week signed a decree lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, days before launching the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik missile at Ukraine. (AFP)

    Biden proposes weight loss drugs under Medicare

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed on Tuesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The costly proposal from the US Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labelled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as US$35 billion over the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,” US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. “It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The rule would not be finalised until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese — someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher — would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese. (AP)

    World oldest man John Tinniswood dies aged 112

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world's oldest man, Briton John Tinniswood, has died aged 112 at the care home where he lived in Southport, northwest England, Guinness World Records said on Tuesday, quoting his family.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tinniswood was born in Liverpool on August 26, 1912, and died on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He became the world's oldest man in April following the death of 114-year-old Venezuelan Juan Vicente Perez.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His last day was surrounded by music and love," the family said in a statement, also thanking "all those who cared for him over the years".
  <br>
  <br>
  Born the same year the Titanic sank and living through both World Wars, Tinniswood told Guinness World Records that the secret to his longevity was "pure luck".
  <br>
  <br>
  "You either live long or you live short, and you can't do much about it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He nonetheless advised moderation in all things to stay healthy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you drink too much or you eat too much or you walk too much, if you do too much of anything, you're going to suffer eventually," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  During World War Two, Tinniswood held an administrative role in the Royal Army Pay Corps, going on to work in accounts for oil giants Shell and BP.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was a life-long supporter of Liverpool football club, and ate fish and chips every Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's oldest living woman currently is Japan's Tomiko Itooka, who is 116.

 Egyptian officials said 16 people were missing after a tourist yacht sank in the Red Sea on Monday after warnings of rough waters.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red Sea Governor Amr Hanafi said preliminary reports suggested a sudden large wave struck the boat, capsizing it within five to seven minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some passengers were in their cabins, which is why they were unable to escape," he added in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hanafi said rescuers saved 28 people from the vessel south of the coastal town of Marsa Alam.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the Red Sea Governorate said the 28 had only minor injuries, such as bruises and scrapes, with none requiring hospitalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governorate said a distress call was received just before dawn from the boat, which had departed from Porto Ghalib in Marsa Alam on Sunday with plans to return to Hurghada Marina on November 29.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 44 people were onboard the yacht, including 13 Egyptians, who include crew members, and 31 foreign nationals from the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Poland, Belgium, Switzerland, Finland, China, Slovakia, Spain, and Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Embassy in Egypt said two Chinese tourists were rescued by other vessels passing through the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy has contacted both tourists, who are said to be in good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the second boat to sink in the area this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, a boat sank after it suffered severe damage from strong waves. No casualties were reported in that incident. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of protesters calling for the release of Pakistan's jailed ex-prime minister Imran Khan defied roadblocks and tear gas to march to the gates of the nation's capital on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government said one police officer was killed and nine were critically wounded in two days of clashes with demonstrators as they closed in on Islamabad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan was barred from standing in February elections that were marred by allegations of rigging.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sidelined by dozens of legal cases which he claimed were fabricated to prevent his comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has defied a government crackdown with regular demonstrations, aiming to seize public spaces in Islamabad and other large cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The capital has been locked down since late Saturday, with mobile internet sporadically cut and more than 20,000 police flooding the streets, many armed with riot shields and batons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the Islamabad city administration announced a two-month ban on public gatherings.
  <br>
  <br>
  But PTI convoys travelled from their power base in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the most populous eastern province of Punjab, hauling aside roadblocks of stacked shipping containers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the early hours of Tuesday, protesters were clashing with police who were firing tear gas and rubber bullets at a motorway entry to Islamabad.
  <br>
  <br>
  PTI's chief demand is the release of Khan, the 72-year-old charismatic former cricket star who served as premier from 2018 to 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been jailed since August 2023, facing legal accusations ranging from illegal marriage to graft and inciting riots. (AFP)

    China 'open to dialogue' after Trump tariff threat

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it remains "open to dialogue" with the United States after president-elect Donald Trump vowed to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China and elsewhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As a principle, we are open to maintaining dialogue and communication," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing, after being asked whether Beijing had reached out to Trump's team for talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in the US said "no one will win a trade war" after Trump said he intends to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico in response to illegal drug trade and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature," Liu Pengyu, an embassy spokesman said in an email to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a series of posts to his Truth Social account on Monday, Trump vowed to hit some of Washington's largest trading partners with duties on all goods entering the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25 percent tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another post, Trump said he would be slapping China with a 10 percent tariff, "above any additional Tariffs," on all of its products entering the US in response to what he said was its failure to tackle fentanyl smuggling.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Canberra, China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, said on Tuesday that the US policy on trade with China and other countries would have an impact on relations between China and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "US policy on trade with China, with other countries as well, will have an impact and that is an important element that we have to consider," Xiao told a press conference in Canberra, in response to a question on whether potential tariffs by Trump would impact China and Australia's bilateral relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada described its trade relationship with the US "mutually beneficial".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will of course continue to discuss these issues with the incoming administration," said a statement from Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many economists have warned that tariffs would hurt growth and push up inflation, since they are primarily paid by importers bringing the goods into the US, who often pass those costs on to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But those in Trump's inner circle have insisted that the tariffs are a useful bargaining chip for the US to use to push its trading partners to agree to more favourable terms, and to bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas. (Agencies)

    Former king Juan Carlos sued for alleged tax offences

<img alt="Juan Carlos, 86, went into self-imposed exile in the United Arab Emirates in 2020. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780780_1_20241125215556.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's disgraced former king Juan Carlos is being sued for alleged tax offences by a group of retired judges, one of the complainants said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spanish prosecutors in March 2022 closed three probes into his finances due to insufficient evidence and the statute of limitations, but said several irregularities had been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them were lucrative gifts from Gulf Arab monarchies and private trips funded by a foundation based in the tiny European state of Liechtenstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The complainants say a court rather than public prosecutors must decide if Juan Carlos fulfilled his tax obligations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Carlos, 86, has made two payments worth more than five million euros to the Spanish tax authorities to settle money owed on undeclared income, widely viewed as a bid to avoid charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  His regularisation of income declarations from 2014 to 2018 "were not done in accordance with the law", former Spanish Supreme Court judge Jose Antonio Martin Pallin told public broadcaster TVE.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not have the slightest interest in prison sentences being applied," but the harshest possible fine should be imposed, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legal experts, philosophers and journalists were also among the complainants, Pallin said, without specifying their number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Carlos enjoyed widespread admiration for his role in Spain's transition to democracy following the death of longtime dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the revelations about the murky origins of his fortune since his abdication in 2014 have done irreparable damage to his reputation and harmed the Spanish monarchy.
  <br>

    DHL cargo plane crashes in Lithuania

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A DHL cargo plane crashed as it came in to land at Lithuania's Vilnius airport early on Monday morning, killing one person on the aircraft and with some debris damaging a house.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three other people onboard were injured but no one on the ground was hurt, officials said. Flames and smoke engulfed the crashed plane as fire crews worked to extinguish the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheduled flight was operated by airline Swiftair on behalf of DHL and had taken off from Leipzig, Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the crash was not immediately known and officials said there was no indication so far that it might be a case of sabotage, although Germany is investigating several fires caused by incendiary devices hidden inside parcels at a warehouse in Leipzig for delivery by DHL earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuanian counter-intelligence chief Darius Jauniskis told reporters: "We cannot reject the possibility of terrorism...but at the moment we can't make attributions or point fingers, because we don't have such information."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-400 crashed around 0330 GMT while approaching Vilnius airport for landing, a spokesperson for Lithuania's National Crisis Management Centre said. The flight had departed from Leipzig at 0208 GMT, Flightradar24 said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security camera footage showed an aircraft descending behind a warehouse after which the night sky was lit up in bright red and orange colours followed by plumes of thick dark smoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue services said the plane hit the ground, split into pieces and slid over 100 metres. Some debris hit a house.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the recording of the conversation between the pilots and the tower, the pilots, until the very last second did not tell the tower of any extraordinary event," said Marius Baranauskas, head of the Lithuanian National Aviation Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to examine the black boxes to know what was happening in the aircraft," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuanian police and prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the incident, and a specialised unit in the Justice Ministry will carry out a civil aviation incident probe, the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only these investigations will answer questions on the real reasons of the incident, speculations and guesses will really not help to determine the truth", Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Lithuanian police spokesperson said one person onboard, a Spanish citizen, was killed and three others - Spanish, German and Lithuanian citizens - were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police told a press conference 12 people had been evacuated from the house hit by debris. There were no casualties on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters poured water onto the smoking building some 1.3 km north of the airport runway and nearby streets were cordoned off.
  <br>
  <br>
  DHL has launched its own investigation into the crash, a spokesperson for the company's Lithuanian arm told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aircraft contained regular parcels. We do not have any information that any of them were suspicious," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A European Union Aviation Safety Agency spokesperson said it was too early to comment on the causes of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 737-400 aircraft involved in the accident was 31 years old, according to a Flightradar24 database. Boeing was working to gather more information and would provide any support, a Boeing spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiftair declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  German security authorities are also investigating the crash and are in close contact with domestic and foreign authorities, a security source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany is already investigating several fires caused by incendiary devices hidden inside parcels at a warehouse in Leipzig earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  British police are investigating a warehouse fire in Birmingham in July, caused by a package catching alight, and liaising with other European law enforcement agencies to see if there was a connection with similar incidents elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig Airport operator Mitteldeutsche Flughafen AG declined to comment on the crash. (Reuters)

    Far-right candidate surprises in Romania elections

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A little-known, far-right populist took the lead in Romania’s presidential election on Sunday, electoral data showed, and will likely face leftist Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu in a run-off vote in two weeks, an outcome that has rocked the country's political landscape.
 <br>
  <br>
  Calin Georgescu, who ran independently, led the polls with around 22 percent of the vote, while Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party, or PSD, trailed at 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party, or USR, stood at about 18 percent, and George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, took around 14 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After polls closed, 9.4 million people — about 52 percent of eligible voters — had cast their ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second round of the vote will be held December 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen candidates ran for the presidency in the European Union and Nato member country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president serves a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georgescu, 62, ran independently and was not widely known. He outperformed most local surveys, sending shockwaves through Romania's political establishment as he ascended to poll position.
  <br>
  <br>
  After casting his ballot on Sunday, Georgescu said in a post on Facebook that he voted “For the unjust, for the humiliated, for those who feel they do not matter and actually matter the most.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, said that Georgescu’s unexpected poll performance appears to be a “large protest or revolt against the establishment.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The mainstream political parties have lost the connection with regular Romanians,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georgescu lacks an agenda, Andrei added, and has a vague and populist manifesto with positions that are “beyond the normal discourse."
  <br>
  <br>
  His stances include supporting Romanian farmers, reducing dependency on imports, and ramping up energy and food production.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to his website, Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania's environment ministry in the 1990s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted to his popular TikTok account, where he has amassed 1.6 million likes, depict him attending church, doing judo, running around an oval track, and speaking on podcasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Sunday's vote, many had expected to see Simion, a vocal supporter of US President-elect Donald Trump, face Ciolacu in the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  He campaigned for reunification with Moldova, which this year renewed a five-year ban on him entering the country over security concerns, and he is banned for the same reason from neighbouring Ukraine. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The presidential candidate of the conservative coalition that has governed Uruguay for the past five years conceded defeat on Sunday after a tight run-off election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The results means the South American nation joined others around the world in rebuking the incumbent party in a year of landmark elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even as the vote count continued, Álvaro Delgado, the centre-right government’s candidate, told supporters at his campaign headquarters in the capital of Montevideo that “with sadness, but without guilt, we can congratulate the winner,” referring to left-wing challenger Yamandú Orsi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fireworks erupted over the stage where Orsi, 57, a working-class former history teacher and two-time mayor from Uruguay's centre-left coalition known as the Broad Front, claimed victory as crowds flocked to greet him.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The country of liberty, equality and fraternity has triumphed once again,” he said, vowing to unite the nation of 3.4 million people after such a tight vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Let's understand that there is another part of our country who have different feelings today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These people will also have to help build a better country. We need them too.”
  <br>
  <br>
  With more than 91 percent of the votes counted, Orsi had close to 50 percent support compared to Delgado’s 46 percent in an election in which nearly 90 percent of voters turned out, according to preliminary data released by the Electoral Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest were blank votes or non-voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  While failing to entice apathetic young voters and generating extraordinary indecision, Uruguay's lacklustre electoral campaigns steered clear of the anti-establishment fury that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere in the world, like in the United States and neighbouring Argentina.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people have been arrested in the United Arab Emirates in connection with the alleged murder of an Israeli citizen, the Emirati interior ministry said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ministry statement did not give details on the suspects or say if they had been charged, but said all legal powers would be used "to respond decisively and without leniency to any actions or attempts that threaten societal stability".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office had denounced the killing of the rabbi, Zvi Kogan, 28, as a "heinous anti-semitic terrorist act" and said Israel would do everything it could to bring those responsible to justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local authorities say Kogan was a resident of the UAE and a Moldovan national.
  <br>
  <br>
  He worked with the New York-based Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement and was reported missing on Thursday. His body was found on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He ran a kosher grocery store in Dubai, where Israelis have flocked for commerce and tourism since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in the 2020 Abraham Accords.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement has held through more than a year of soaring regional tensions unleashed by Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza and its attack of Lebanon, after months of fighting with the Hezbollah militant group, have stoked anger among Emiratis, Arab nationals and others living in the UAE.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Sunday, the UAE’s state-run WAM news agency acknowledged Kogan’s disappearance but pointedly did not acknowledge he held Israeli citizenship, referring to him only as being Moldovan. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistani government team mediated a seven-day ceasefire deal between rival sectarian groups on Sunday, halting days of clashes that have killed some 70 people and injured dozens in the northwest of the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The violence began when gunmen attacked convoys of civilian vehicles on Thursday, killing at least 40 people, mostly Shi'ite Muslims.
  <br>
  <br>
  That sparked retaliatory attacks against Sunni Muslim residents and there were pitched battles between armed groups from both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armed Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims have engaged in tribal and sectarian rivalry for decades over a land dispute in Kurram district near the Afghanistan border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both sides have agreed to a week-long ceasefire which is expected to be extended," Muhammad Ali Saif, a member of the mediation team, told Reuters by phone, adding that major clashes had already stopped.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saif, who is the information minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province - where Kurram is located - said both sides also agreed to exchange prisoners, including women and the bodies of those killed in the clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prisoners and bodies would be exchanged with assistance from Pakistani paramilitary forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team flew into Parachinar, Kurram's main city, on Saturday and met Shi'ite and Sunni tribal leaders with the entire district under curfew and armed groups roaming the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saif said news of the ceasefire should also halt smaller skirmishes that had been reported in remote areas of the district.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another member of the mediation team, Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, the police chief of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said Shi'ite leaders were demanding the immediate arrest of those involved in attacking passenger vehicles, as well as compensation for the victims and safety assurances for travelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is yet to identify or publicly name who the attackers were and no one has claimed responsibility. (Reuters)

<img alt="Josep Borrell (pictured) speaks during a press conference after meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri in Beirut. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780634_1_20241124203648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for an "immediate ceasefire" in the Israel-Hezbollah war while on a visit to the Lebanese capital for talks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since September 23, Israel has intensified its air campaign in Lebanon, later sending in ground troops following nearly a year of limited exchanges of fire initiated by Hezbollah in support of its ally Hamas after the Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see only one possible way ahead: an immediate ceasefire and the full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701," Borrell said after meeting Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who has led mediation efforts on behalf of Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Resolution 1701 ended the last Hezbollah-Israel war of 2006 and stated that Lebanese troops and UN peacekeepers should be the only armed forces in the country's south, where Hezbollah holds sway.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also called for Israel to withdraw troops from Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Back in September I came and was still hoping we could prevent a full-fledged war of Israel attacking Lebanon," Borrell said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two months later Lebanon is on the brink of collapse."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the European Union was ready to provide 200 million euros for Lebanon's army, whose deployment in larger numbers along the border forms a crucial point in truce talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  France and Washington have been spearheading ceasefire efforts, with US envoy Amos Hochstein visiting Lebanon and Israel this week to discuss a truce plan based on implementing Resolution 1701.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must pressure the Israeli government and maintain the pressure on Hezbollah to accept the US proposal for a ceasefire," Borrell said, calling for an "immediate" truce. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Raging orange flames and thick black smoke billowed into the sky on Sunday as fire ripped through hundreds of houses in a closely built slum area of the Philippine capital Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manila Fire District said around 1,000 houses were burned in the blaze that is thought to have started on the second floor of one of the homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no immediate reports of casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drone footage shared online by the city's disaster agency showed houses in Isla Puting Bato village of Manila razed to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  The structures housed around 2,000 families, according to the fire department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Village resident Leonila Abiertas, 65, lost almost all her possessions, but managed to save her late husband's ashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only got the urn with the ashes of my husband," a crying Abiertas told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really don't know how I can start my life again after this fire."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire and disaster services deployed 36 trucks and four fire boats while the country's air force sent in two helicopters to help extinguish the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That area is fire-prone since most of the houses there are made of light materials," firefighter Geanelli Nunez told AFP. (AFP)

 A man was shot dead and three members of the security services wounded after gunfire at dawn on Sunday in the neighbourhood in Jordan's capital where the Israeli embassy is located, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Public Security Directorate announced that it dealt with an incident of gunfire at a patrol operating in the Rabieh area in the capital, Amman, at dawn on Sunday," the official Petra news agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said a gunman opened fire on a patrol and was later surrounded by security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man "started firing gunshots at the security force, which in turn applied the rules of engagement, which resulted in the killing of the perpetrator", the agency added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said three public security personnel were injured during the incident and were receiving treatment. (AFP)

    Climate summit US$300bn deal 'a paltry sum'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world approved a bitterly negotiated climate deal on Sunday but poorer nations most at the mercy of worsening disasters dismissed a US$300 billion a year pledge from wealthy historic polluters as insultingly low.
 <br>
  <br>
  After two exhausting weeks of chaotic bargaining and sleepless nights, nearly 200 nations banged through the contentious finance pact in the early hours in a sports stadium in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the applause had barely subsided in Baku when India delivered a full-throated rejection of the dollar-figure just agreed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount that is proposed to be mobilised is abysmally poor. It's a paltry sum," said Indian delegate Leena Nandan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This document is little more than an optical illusion. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nations had struggled to reconcile long-standing divisions over how much rich nations most accountable for historic climate change should provide to poorer countries least responsible but most impacted by Earth's rapid warming.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra said COP29 would be remembered as "the start of a new era for climate finance".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sleep-deprived diplomats, huddled in anxious groups, were still revising the final phrasing on the plenary floor hours before the deal passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  At points, the talks appeared on the brink of collapse, with developing nations storming out of meetings and threatening to walk away should rich nations not cough up more cash.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the end -- despite repeating that no deal is better than a bad deal -- they did not stand in the way of an agreement, despite it falling well short of what they wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final deal commits developed nations to pay at least US$300 billion a year by 2035 to help developed countries green their economies and prepare for worse disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is up from US$100 billion under an existing pledge but was slammed as offensively low by developing nations who had demanded much more.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This COP has been a disaster for the developing world," said Mohamed Adow, the Kenyan director of Power Shift Africa, a think tank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a betrayal of both people and planet, by wealthy countries who claim to take climate change seriously."
  <br>
  <br>
  A group of 134 developing countries had pushed for at least US$500 billion from rich governments to build resilience against climate change and cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN climate chief Simon Stiell acknowledged the deal was imperfect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country got everything they wanted, and we leave Baku with a mountain of work still to do. So this is no time for victory laps," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States and EU have wanted newly wealthy emerging economies like China -- the world's largest emitter -- to chip in.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final deal "encourages" developing countries to make contributions on a voluntary basis, reflecting no change for China which already provides climate finance on its own terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy nations said it was politically unrealistic to expect more in direct government funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump, a sceptic of both climate change and foreign assistance, returns to the White House in January and a number of other Western countries have seen right-wing backlashes against the green agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal posits a larger overall target of US$1.3 trillion per year to cope with rising temperatures and disasters, but most would come from private sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy countries and small island nations were also concerned by efforts led by Saudi Arabia to water down calls from last year's summit in Dubai to phase out fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main texts proposed in Baku lacked any explicit mention of the Dubai commitment to "transitioning away from fossil fuels".
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of countries had accused Azerbaijan, an authoritarian oil and gas exporter, of lacking the experience and will to meet the moment, as the planet again sets temperature records and faces rising deadly disasters. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sudanese army said on Saturday it had retaken a key state capital south of Khartoum from rival paramilitaries who had held it for the past five months.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Sennar state capital of Sinja is a strategic prize in the 19-month-old war between the regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces as it lies on a key road linking army-controlled areas of eastern and central Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army said that Sinja had been "liberated... from the terrorist militia."
  <br>
  <br>
  It posted footage on social media that it said had been filmed inside the main base in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sinja has returned to the embrace of the nation," the information minister of the army-backed government, Khaled al-Aiser, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aiser's office said armed forces chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan had travelled to the city of Sennar, 60 kilometres to the north, on Saturday to "inspect the operation and celebrate the liberation of Sinja."
  <br>
  <br>
  The RSF had taken the two cities in a lightning offensive in June that saw nearly 726,000 civilians flee, according to UN figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Human rights groups have said that those who were unwilling or unable to leave have faced months of arbitrary violence by RSF fighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinja teacher Abdullah al-Hassan spoke of his "indescribable joy" at seeing the army enter the city after "months of terror."
  <br>
  <br>
  "At any moment, you were waiting for militia fighters to barge in and beat you or loot you," the 53-year-old said by telephone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides in the Sudanese conflict have been accused of war crimes, including indiscriminately shelling homes, markets and hospitals.

  The RSF has also been accused of summary executions, systematic sexual violence and rampant looting.

  The paramilitaries control nearly all of the vast western region of Darfur as well as large swathes of Kordofan in the south. They also hold much of the capital Khartoum and the key farming state of Al-Jazira to its south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since April 2023, the war has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 11 million – creating what the UN says is the world's largest displacement crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the eastern state of Gedaref – where more than 1.1 million displaced people have sought refuge – Asia Khedr, 46, said she hoped her family's ordeal might soon be at an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll finally go home and say goodbye to this life of displacement and suffering," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain and Ireland faced travel chaos on Saturday as a winter storm battered northwest Europe with strong winds, heavy rain, snow and ice.
 <br>
  <br>
  Storm Bert left at least 60,000 properties in Ireland without power and closed roads and some ferry and train routes on both sides of the Irish Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Media footage showed flooding in the west of Ireland, while floods prompted rail closures in Northern Ireland and snow impacted travel across Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heaviest snow hit Scotland and parts of northern and central England, with dozens of flood alerts in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK Met Office issued warnings for snow and ice for those regions, warning there was a "good chance some rural communities could be cut off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scottish hills could see up to 40 centimetres of snow, while winds approaching 113 kilometres per hour were recorded in parts of Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferry operator DFDS cancelled services on some routes until Monday, with sailings from Newhaven and Dover in southern England to Dieppe and Calais in France severely affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flights were disrupted at Newcastle Airport due to heavy snow, with some flights diverted to Belfast and Edinburgh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avanti West Coast, which runs rail services between England and Scotland, advised customers not to attempt travel beyond the northern English city of Preston, as it cancelled numerous trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Highways also issued a "severe weather alert," warning of "blizzard conditions" affecting Yorkshire and northeast England, with a number of road closures announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Met Eireann, the Irish National Meteorological Service, had also issued a yellow warning for "very strong winds and heavy rain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The worst impacted areas for power outages in Ireland were in western and northwestern counties, according to ESB Networks, which runs the country's electricity system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Crews and contractors are deployed and restoring power in impacted areas where it is safe to do so," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 4,000 properties across Britain were without power by mid-Saturday -- the majority in southwest England – with the National Grid operator saying power had been restored to "many homes and businesses."
  <br>
  <br>
  Blackburn Rovers Championship football fixture against Portsmouth was postponed because of the storm. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lebanon said an Israeli air strike in the heart of Beirut that brought down a residential building and jolted residents across the city killed at least 11 people on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The attack in the capital was followed by others in the city's southern suburbs after calls by the Israeli military to evacuate the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has not commented on the strike in central Beirut, while Hezbollah has yet to mention it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue operations were underway in the area on Saturday morning, with an excavator removing the rubble of the eight-storey building, and a fire truck and civil defence rescuers stationed nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The strike was so strong it felt like the building was about to fall on our heads," said Samir, 60, who lives in a building facing the one that was destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he fled his home in the middle of the night with his wife and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw two dead people on the ground... The children started crying and their mother cried even more," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli strike, which hit the working-class Basta neighbourhood, killed at least 11 people and wounded 63, Lebanon's health ministry said, adding it had also left behind "a large amount of body parts that are being identified."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The final death toll will be determined after DNA tests are carried out," the ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The state-run National News Agency said Israeli jets had launched six missiles at the structure, causing "widespread destruction in buildings" nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pre-dawn attack in Basta was not preceded by an evacuation warning from Israel's military.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Lebanese security source said on condition of anonymity that the strike had "targeted a leading Hezbollah figure," though it was unclear if they were killed. The official did not name the figure. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea has decided not to attend a memorial ceremony set to take place in Japan to honour wartime forced labour victims, including many Koreans, its foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing unspecified disagreements with Tokyo.
 <br>
  <br>
  The East Asian neighbours have long been at odds over historical issues linked to Japan's brutal colonial occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including sexual slavery and forced labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, a network of mines on a Japanese island infamous for using conscripted wartime labour was added to Unesco's World Heritage register, after South Korea voiced objections to its listing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul had dropped its initial objections "on the condition that Japan faithfully implements the recommendation... to reflect the 'full history' at the Sado Gold Mine site."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo had agreed to host a memorial event every year – its first edition set to be held on Sado Island on Sunday – to honour the forced labour victims, as a condition for South Korea's consent to the Unesco listing.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Saturday, Seoul said the country would "not attend the Sado mine memorial ceremony, scheduled for November 24, taking into account various circumstances surrounding the event."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was insufficient time to reconcile differing positions between the diplomatic authorities of both countries, making it unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable agreement before the ceremony," it added, without elaborating further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo said earlier this week that Akiko Ikuina, a parliamentary vice minister at Japan's foreign ministry, will attend the ceremony as the government's representative, according to Seoul's Yonhap news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was met with criticism from some local media outlets in Seoul, as she has visited the Yasukuni Shrine – a site considered highly sensitive in South Korea due to the enshrinement of some of Japan's war criminals there. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 32 people were killed and 47 wounded in sectarian clashes in northwest Pakistan, an official said on Saturday, two days after attacks on Shi'ite passenger convoys killed 43.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sporadic fighting between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims in the mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan has killed around 150 over the past months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fighting between Shi'ite and Sunni communities continues at multiple locations. According to the latest reports, 32 people have been killed which include 14 Sunnis and 18 Shi'ites," a senior administrative official said on condition of anonymity on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, gunmen opened fire on two separate convoys of Shi'ite Muslims travelling with a police escort in Kurram, killing 43 while 11 wounded are still in "critical condition", officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In retaliation, Shi'ite Muslims on Friday evening attacked several Sunni locations in the Kurram district, once a semi-autonomous region, where sectarian violence has resulted in the deaths of hundreds over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Around 7 pm (1400 GMT), a group of enraged Shi'ite individuals attacked the Sunni-dominated Bagan Bazaar," said a senior police officer stationed in Kurram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After firing, they set the entire market ablaze and entered nearby homes, pouring petrol and setting them on fire. Initial reports suggest over 300 shops and more than 100 houses have been burned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local Sunnis "also fired back at the attackers," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Javedullah Mehsud, a senior official in Kurram said there were "efforts to restore peace ... (through) the deployment of security forces" and with the help of "local elders." (AFP)

    Rich nations raise climate pledge offer to US$300bn

<img alt="The previous offer of US$250bn a year had been panned by developing countries as insultingly low. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780526_1_20241123153155.jpg&q=65">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union, United States and other wealthy countries at the COP29 climate summit have agreed to raise their offer of a global finance target to US$300 billion per year by 2035, sources said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The summit had been due to finish on Friday but ran into overtime as negotiators from nearly 200 countries – who must adopt the deal by consensus – tried to reach agreement on the world's climate funding plan for the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shift in position came after a US$250 billion proposal for a deal, drafted by Azerbaijan's COP29 presidency on Friday, was panned by developing countries as insultingly low.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear if the wealthy countries' revised position had been communicated to developing countries at COP29, and whether it would be enough to win their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five sources with knowledge of the closed-door discussions said the EU had agreed they could accept the higher number. Two of the sources said the United States, Australia and Britain were also on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  A European Commission spokesperson and an Australian government spokesperson both declined to comment on the negotiations. The US delegation at COP29 and the UK energy ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates were awaiting a new draft text of the deal on climate finance on Saturday after negotiators worked through the night to bridge wide gaps in their positions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The COP29 talks have laid bare the divisions between wealthy governments constrained by tight domestic budgets and developing nations reeling from the soaring costs of storms, floods and droughts fuelled by climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new goal is intended to replace developed countries' previous commitment to provide US$100 billion in climate finance for poorer nations per year by 2020. That goal was met two years late, in 2022, and expires in 2025. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Friday that hospitals have only two days' fuel left before they must restrict services, after the United Nations warned aid delivery to the war-devastated territory is being crippled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The warning came a day after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant more than a year into the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN and others have repeatedly decried humanitarian conditions, particularly in northern Gaza, where Israel said on Friday it had killed two commanders involved in Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza medics said an overnight Israeli raid on the cities of Beit Lahia and nearby Jabalia resulted in dozens killed or missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marwan al-Hams, director of Gaza's field hospitals, told reporters all hospitals in the Palestinian territory "will stop working or reduce their services within 48 hours due to the occupation's (Israel's) obstruction of fuel entry".
  <br>
  <br>
  World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was "deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of 80 patients, including 8 in the intensive care unit" at Kamal Adwan hospital, one of just two partly operating in northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late Thursday, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Muhannad Hadi, said, "The delivery of critical aid across Gaza, including food, water, fuel and medical supplies, is grinding to a halt."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that for more than six weeks, Israeli authorities "have been banning commercial imports" while "a surge in armed looting" has hit aid convoys. (AFP)

<img alt="The Hieron Museum, one of France's oldest for sacred art, has been targeted several times in recent years. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780441_1_20241122194124.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Armed robbers snatched jewels worth millions from a work by famed Parisian goldsmith Joseph Chaumet and classed a national treasure in a brazen heist at a French museum.
 <br>
  <br>
  Motorbike-riding thieves arrived at the Hieron Museum in Paray-le-Monial in central France at around 4:00 pm (1500 GMT) on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three entered the building and one stood guard outside, mayor Jean-Marc Nesme said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group fired several shots before heading for the museum's star exhibit, a three-metre work executed in 1904 depicting the life of Christ in precious metals, jewels and ivory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known as "Via Vitae", it is classed as a national treasure by France's culture ministry, with an estimated value of up to seven million euros (US$7.3 million), mayor Nesme said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intruders sawed through the armoured glass protecting the piece with a power tool before snatching gold and ivory figurines as well as emerald decorations from the piece.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gigantic piece comprises 138 figures encrusted with diamonds and rubies set in marble of various shades and alabaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they fled on their motorbikes, the gang sowed spikes across the road to hobble two pursuing vehicles, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a great loss for Paray-le-Monial and for national heritage", mayor Nesme said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff and around 20 visitors present on the museum's ground floor had been "traumatised" by the violent intrusion, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hieron Museum, one of France's oldest for sacred art, has previously been targeted by thieves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two gold crowns were stolen in 2017, while there was another attempted robbery in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's theft came a day after several precious objects including ornate snuffboxes were stolen from a central Paris museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad daylight robbery saw thieves break into a display case with axes and baseball bats in full view of visitors and staff at the Cognacq-Jay museum. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new draft of a global climate agreement released on Friday at COP29 in Azerbaijan proposes that developed countries provide US$250 billion annually by 2035 to help poorer countries fight global warming.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time a concrete number has been formally proposed at the UN climate talks in Baku, and comes on the final day of a summit dominated by divisions over money.
  <br>
  <br>
  The text sets an ambitious overall target to raise a total of US$1.3 trillion a year by 2035, with the money from rich governments at the core of funding that would be coupled with private-sector investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nearly 200 nations at COP29 had struggled to agree on a new goal that boosted assistance for developing nations to cut emissions and adapt to climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing pledge committed wealthy nations most responsible historically for global warming to provide US$100 billion a year in climate finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  An influential negotiation bloc of 134 developing nations including China has demanded at least five times that figure from developed countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major contributors such as the European Union had said such demands were politically unrealistic and that private-sector money must play a large part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many countries have also pushed at COP29 for a redoubling of efforts to cut planet-heating emissions, something opposed by the Arab Group of nations which does not want fossil fuels singled out. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgian authorities said on Friday they had seized almost five tonnes of cocaine stashed in shipping containers at Antwerp port, as part of a cross-border investigation into a drug trafficking ring.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said eight people were detained following searches carried out in Belgium and the Netherlands earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The inspections led to the seizure of 185,000 euros (US$193,000) in cash as well as weapons, jewellery, luxury handbags, watches and 4.78 tonnes of cocaine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe focused on a criminal organisation involved in trafficking cocaine to Belgium from South America, Central America and Canada, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group allegedly facilitated the clearing of suspicious containers in the port of Antwerp and, in return for payment, provided logistical assistance to other organisations, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antwerp's port is one of the major gateways for drugs smuggled from South America to the European market, and busts in and around the vast facility occur frequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cocaine seizures there hit a record 116 tonnes last year. (AFP)

    Australian teen dies from suspected methanol poisoning

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian teenager died on Thursday after drinking alcohol contaminated with methanol in Laos, Thai police and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, the fourth foreign national now suspected to have died in the incident.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bianca Jones, 19, fell ill last week in Vang Vieng, a town in the Southeast Asian nation popular with foreign backpackers that is about two hours north of the capital Vientiane by road.
  <br>
  <br>
  She died on Thursday after being taken to a hospital in neighbouring Thailand on November 13, police in the city of Udon Thani said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The physician who examined her said the cause of death was a methanol poisoning, from fake liquor," Phattanawong Chanphon, a police official in the Thai city, told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount of methanol in her body was high, leading to swelling of the brain."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian media said Jones was the fourth foreign tourist to die after consuming the contaminated alcohol, following two Danes and an American.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is every parent's worst fear and a nightmare no one should have to endure," Albanese told parliament on Thursday. "All Australians offer them our deepest sympathy in this time of heartbreak."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones' friend Holly Bowles, also 19, is in critical condition and on life support, her father Shaun Bowles told reporters outside Bangkok Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurious liquor is a problem in Laos, with the governments of Australia and Britain warning citizens to be cautious when taking drinks there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Methanol is a toxic alcohol that is used industrially as a solvent, pesticide, and alternative fuel source, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bowles and Jones stayed at the Nana Backpackers Hostel in Vang Vieng last week and drank at the hostel’s bar before they went out for the evening, Australian media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  They failed to check out on November 13, when hostel staff rushed the pair to the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vietnamese manager of the hostel has been detained for questioning, the Laos tourist police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No charges have been made, however, as police are still "investigating," an official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. (Agencies)

    Duct-taped banana sells for US$6.2m at auction

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A piece of conceptual art consisting of a simple banana, duct-taped to a wall, sold for US$6.2 million at an auction in New York on Wednesday, with the winning bid coming from a prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Comedian," by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was a phenomenon when it debuted in 2019 at Art Basel Miami Beach, as festivalgoers tried to make out whether the single yellow piece of fruit affixed to a white wall with silver duct tape was a joke or cheeky commentary on art collectors. At one point, performance artist David Datuna took the banana off the wall and ate it, saying he felt "hungry" while inspecting it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece attracted so much attention that it had to be withdrawn from view. But three editions sold for between US$120,000 and US$150,000, according to the gallery handling sales at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five years later, Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON, has now paid more than 40 times that higher price point at the Sotheby’s auction. Or, more accurately, Sun purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives him the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it "Comedian".
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece attracted  attention at the auction at Sotheby's, with attendees in the crowded room holding up phones to take photos as two handlers wearing white gloves stood at both sides of the banana, which was bought from a Bangladeshi fruit seller on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, according to The New York Times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bidding started at US$800,000 and within minutes shot up to US$2 million, then US$3 million, then $4 million, and higher, as the auctioneer, Oliver Barker, joked "Don't let it slip away."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Don’t miss this opportunity," Barker said. "These are words I've never thought I'd say: Five million dollars for a banana."
  <br>
  <br>
  The final hammer price announced in the room was US$5.2 million, which did not include the about US$1 million in auction house fees, paid by the buyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Sun said the piece "represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community". But he said the latest version of "Comedian" will not last long.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additionally, in the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sotheby’s calls Cattelan "among Contemporary Art’s most brilliant provocateurs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has persistently disrupted the art world’s status quo in meaningful, irreverent, and often controversial ways," the auction house said in a description of "Comedian".
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for other works such as a golden toilet called "America", Cattelan has explained the banana work as a critical commentary on the art market, which he has criticised in the past for being speculative and failing to help artists. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant, as well as a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, the court said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In their decision to grant the warrants, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for starvation in Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  The warrant for Al-Masri lists charges of mass killings during the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that triggered the Gaza war, including rape and the taking of hostages. The prosecution indicated it would continue to gather information with respect to his reported death.
  <br>
  <br>
  ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced on May 20 that he was seeking arrest warrants for alleged crimes connected to the Hamas-led attacks on Israel and the Israeli military response in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza. Israel has said it killed Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, in an airstrike but Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied this.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett said the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were a "mark of shame" for the court. Israel's main opposition leader Yair Lapid also denounced the court's move, calling it "a reward for terrorism".
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu or Gallant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli and Hamas leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court does not have its own police force to carry out arrests and relies on its member states for that. ICC members include all European Union countries, Britain, Japan, Brazil, Australia and Canada, and in the Middle East region the Palestinian territories and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC said Israel's acceptance of the court's jurisdiction was not required. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain has imposed a travel ban and an asset freeze on Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos under its global anti-corruption sanctions regime, the British government said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dos Santos, whose father Jose Eduardo dos Santos ruled Angola for 38 years until 2017, has faced corruption accusations in Angola and elsewhere for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Africa's first female billionaire denies the allegations and says she is the target of a long-running political vendetta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said dos Santos misappropriated more than 50 million pounds (US$63.19 million) for her own financial benefit while she run Angolan state oil firm Sonangol.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said she misappropriated more than 300 million pounds while she was director of telecoms company Unitel .
  <br>
  <br>
  Dos Santos lost an appeal to overturn an order freezing up to 580 million pounds of her assets in September as part a lawsuit at London's High Court brought by Unitel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global police agency Interpol confirmed in 2022 it had issued a red notice for dos Santos, who says she lives in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British government has added seven other designations targeting other individuals under the same global anti-corruption case. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Texas authorities have offered the incoming Trump administration land on the border with Mexico to build "deportation facilities" in support of the president-elect's plan for the mass removal of undocumented migrants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Incoming president Donald Trump said this week he planned to declare a national emergency on border security and use the US military to carry out the mass deportation of undocumented migrants after taking office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the Texas General Land Office announced that commissioner Dawn Buckingham has offered him more than 1,400 acres (570 hectares) of public land on the US southern border "to aid his administration in carrying out their deportation plans".
  <br>
  <br>
  The plot of land is a ranch along the Rio Grande river -- serving as a border between the United States and Mexico -- in Starr county. It was acquired by the office in late October, the statement from the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a letter dated Tuesday, Buckingham said she had authorized a 1.5-mile easement on the ranch to allow "the Texas Border Wall to be built" after the land was acquired.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her office was "fully prepared" to work with US federal agencies to "allow a facility to be built for the processing, detention, and coordination of the largest deportation of violent criminals in the nation's history."
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump has repeatedly railed against undocumented migrants during the election campaign, blaming them for "poisoning the blood" of the country and highlighting violent crimes perpetrated by members of the migrant community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before his first term as president, he had pledged to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, but the project was never completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, said he would "marshal every lever of power to secure the border", according to US broadcaster ABC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities estimate that about 11 million people are living in the United States illegally -- many fleeing violence or economic troubles in their countries and looking for a better life in America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's deportation plan is expected to impact around 20 million families. (AFP)

  Prescott, who served under Blair from 1997 to 2007, was known as a plain-speaking politician who bridged the divide between the traditional left-wing and the modernisers in the Labour Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dubbed an old-school political "bruiser", he famously punched a member of the public during an election campaign in 2001, after he had been hit by an egg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, it would have all been better if it hadn't happened," Blair said at the time. But added: "John is John".
  <br>
  <br>
  Prescott was born on May 31, 1938, in a seaside house in Wales. His father was a railway signalman, his mother a maid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aged 17, he went to sea as a steward on a luxury cruise ship where boxing bouts were organised among the crew to entertain the passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He went into politics after coming ashore and he attended Oxford's Ruskin College, which offered courses for mature students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prescott entered parliament in 1970 and worked his way up the ranks, becoming a key player in the Labour Party's historic three election victories from 1997 to 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  He acted as a peace broker in the often fraught relationship between Blair and his future successor, Gordon Brown, and was later called "Two Jags" after he used his ministerial car for a 200 yard journey, which he said was needed to prevent his wife's hair from being blown about in the wind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blair said he was devastated by the news.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics; one of the most committed and loyal; and definitely the most unusual," he said. "There was nothing about John which fitted conventional wisdom. (Reuters)

    Indian tycoon Adani charged in US over fraud

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Billionaire Indian industrialist Gautam Adani has been charged with paying hundreds of millions of dollars of bribes and hiding the payments from investors, US prosecutors said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With a business empire spanning coal, airports, cement and media, the chairman of Adani Group has been rocked in recent years by corporate fraud allegations and a stock crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The close ally of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow Gujarat native, is alleged to have agreed to pay more than US$250 million in bribes to Indian officials for lucrative solar energy supply contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deals were projected to generate more than US$2 billion in profits after tax, over roughly 20 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  None of the multiple defendants in the case, including Adani, are in custody, the prosecutor's office told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors say one of Adani's alleged accomplices meticulously tracked bribe payments, using his phone to log the bungs offered to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This indictment alleges schemes to pay over US$250 million in bribes to Indian government officials, to lie to investors and banks to raise billions of dollars, and to obstruct justice," said US Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Gautam Adani and seven other business executives allegedly bribed the Indian government to finance lucrative contracts designed to benefit their businesses... while still other defendants allegedly attempted to conceal the bribery conspiracy by obstructing the government's investigation," said the FBI's James Dennehy.
  <br>
  <br>
  A self-described introvert, Adani keeps a low profile and rarely speaks to the media, often sending lieutenants to front corporate events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adani was born in Ahmedabad, Gujarat state, to a middle-class family but dropped out of school at 16 and moved to financial capital Mumbai to find work in the city's lucrative gem trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a short stint in his brother's plastics business, he launched the flagship family conglomerate that bears his name in 1988 by branching out into the export trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  His big break came seven years later with a contract to build and operate a commercial shipping port in Gujarat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adani Group's rapid expansion into capital-intensive businesses previously raised alarms, with Fitch subsidiary and market researcher CreditSights warning in 2022 it was "deeply over-leveraged."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023 a bombshell report from US investment firm Hindenburg Research claimed the conglomerate had engaged in a "brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hindenburg said a pattern of "government leniency towards the group" stretching back decades had left investors, journalists, citizens and politicians unwilling to challenge its conduct "for fear of reprisal." (AFP)

    US defends decision to supply landmines to Ukraine

<img alt="The US-supplied mines can self-destruct or render themselves inactive after losing battery charge – in theory limiting the risk to civilians. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780181_1_20241121091910.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US decision to send anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine – in a major policy shift – was triggered by a change in Russian battlefield tactics favouring infantry over mechanised units, US Defence Secretary Loyd Austin said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "They don't lead with their mechanised forces any more," Austin told reporters while on a visit to Laos. "They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanised forces."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainians "have a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Joe Biden's reversal of his previous curbs on US landmines comes just days after Washington gave Ukraine the green light to use US-made long-range missiles on targets within Russia, as the outgoing administration aims to give Kyiv the upper hand before President-elect Donald Trump enters office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden in 2022 said the United States would mostly ban its use of landmines, at the time specifically drawing a contrast with Russia's use of the weapons in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reversal comes amid concerns about the incoming Trump administration's lack of support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is entering office having repeatedly criticised US assistance for Ukraine, claiming he could secure a ceasefire within hours – comments that have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about Ukraine's ability to withstand the Russian attacks without American support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Russia and the United States – neither of which are signatories to the UN Mine Ban Treaty – have been criticised for their past use of anti-personnel mines in the past. Ukraine is a signatory of the treaty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Austin said the US-supplied mines would be so-called "nonpersistent" mines that can self-destruct or render themselves inactive after losing battery charge – in theory limiting the risk to civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Moscow and Kyiv are jockeying to secure battlefield advantage before Trump assumes office next January.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week, Kyiv fired US-supplied ATACMS missiles at Russian territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree lowering the threshold for when Russia could use nuclear weapons. (AFP)

    President Xi Jinping begins state visit to Brazil

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called for "more voices" to end the Ukraine war and a ceasefire in Gaza, as he conducted a state visit to Brazil's capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said Xi wanted to see "more voices committed to peace to pave the way for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis" and "a ceasefire and an end to the war at an early date" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the appeal during a state visit to Brasilia, where he was hosted by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Brasilia have advanced a joint roadmap for peace in Ukraine that has been endorsed by Moscow but rejected by Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a world plagued by armed conflicts and political strife, China and Brazil put peace, diplomacy and dialogue first," Lula said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's appeal for a halt to fighting in Gaza - where Israel is pressing an offensive against Hamas - echoed one he and the other G20 leaders made during a summit held Monday and Tuesday in Rio.
  <br>
  <br>
  That summit's joint statement called for a "comprehensive" ceasefire in both Gaza and Lebanon, where Israel is also waging an offensive against the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's state visit to Brasilia showcased closer relations between the biggest economies in Asia and Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders signed 35 cooperation accords on areas including agriculture, trade, technology and environmental protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China-Brazil relations "are at their best in history" and the two countries are now "reliable friends," according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula said he looked forward to welcoming Xi to Brazil again next July for a Brics summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit to Brazil's capital comes fresh off his attendance at a G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, and an Apec summit last week in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese leader figured prominently at both summits, in contrast with outgoing US President Joe Biden, who cut a spectral figure as fellow leaders looked past him, politically, to the coming presidency of Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  That difference also spoke to China's ascendant role as a trade partner and investor in Latin America, and expectations that America under Trump will erect trade and migration barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula welcomed Xi with full honours, greeting him on the red carpet as horse-mounted guards rode past, a military brass band played their national anthems, and lines of children waved Chinese and Brazilian flags. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis on Wednesday said he will canonise Carlo Acutis next April, setting the eagerly awaited date for the late teenager to become the Catholic Church’s first millennial and digital-era saint.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis made the announcement at the end of his weekly general audience on Wednesday, saying he would proclaim the church's youngest contemporary saint during the Jubilee of Adolescents at the Vatican on April 25-27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials later confirmed the canonisation Mass would occur on April 27 at the Vatican.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acutis, who was born to Italian parents in London, was a web designer who died of leukaemia in Italy in 2006 at the age of 15. Francis beatified him in 2020 in Assisi, where his tomb draws a steady stream of pilgrims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touted as the “patron saint of the internet,” Acutis used his natural tech talent to create a website to catalog miracles and took care of websites for some local Catholic organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis announced in May that he had approved a second miracle attributed to Acutis’ intercession, paving the way for Wednesday’s announcement. (AP)

    Ukraine criticises Western allies for embassy closures

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Wednesday called on its Western allies not to fuel tensions inside the country, after a string of embassies in Kyiv announced they would close, citing the threat of a "massive air attack" on the capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  The warnings of fresh strikes come as Moscow looks to retaliate against Ukraine for firing US-supplied long-range missiles at Russian territory for the first time and with the Kremlin accusing outgoing US President Joe Biden of dragging out the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has already ramped up a wave of deadly missile strikes in recent days, targeting residential areas and Ukraine's energy grid. Air alerts blare out across the country daily.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States led the wave of closures, saying it was shutting its Kyiv office to the public after having received "specific information of a potential significant air attack" on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not provide further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece, Hungary, Italy and Spain – all Nato members – followed suit, announcing the closures of their diplomatic premises in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian officials criticised the rare move and called on its allies not to spread yet more fear among Ukrainian society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv said the "information" the US was referring to looked to be a "psychological operation" launched by Moscow in a bid to destabilise the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remind you that the threat of strikes by the aggressor state has unfortunately been a daily reality for Ukrainians for over 1,000 days," Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nerves are already frayed in Kyiv after almost three years of war, and Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has injected fresh uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has repeatedly criticised US support for Ukraine and claimed he could broker a ceasefire within hours – comments that have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about Ukraine's ability to withstand the Russian attacks without American support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Ukraine and Russia are jockeying for the upper hand on the battlefield before he re-enters the White House in January. (AFP)

<img alt='US Director Joel Souza - author of the "Rust" movie, talks during an AFP interview at Camerimage film festival in Torun, Poland.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Western "Rust" will get its world premiere on Wednesday at a Polish film festival, three years after its cinematographer was killed in a tragic on-set shooting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hollywood star Alec Baldwin was accused of violating basic gun safety rules in the 2021 death of Halyna Hutchins, but his involuntary manslaughter trial collapsed earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hutchins's mother refused to attend the premiere "when there is still no justice for my daughter".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologise to me and take responsibility for her death," Olga Solovey said Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, will introduce the movie at the Camerimage film festival -- known for celebrating cinematography -- in Torun, northern Poland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the "massive devastation" of the shooting left him an emotional wreck.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Rust' just became this sort of insane hurricane," he told AFP. "You're just left to sort of pick up the pieces."
  <br>
  <br>
  The filmmaker admitted that he agonised over whether to complete the movie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely on the fence... There was a time when I thought I just didn't want to make movies anymore," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said what convinced him to finish it was learning that Hutchins's husband wanted her final work to be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Camerimage said it was also Hutchins's "dream" to have her work shown at the festival, but that "Baldwin will not be there".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Emmy-winning actor was holding a revolver during a rehearsal on set in New Mexico when a live round was fired, fatally wounding 42-year-old Hutchins.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a tragic irony, the film centres on an accidental killing -- a parallel that Souza called "unsettling".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a strange one to unpack. When people hear about it, they generally fall silent for a few moments because they can't believe" it, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Souza and Baldwin developed the script from research Souza was doing on the youngest person ever to be hanged in the Old West.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rust" tells the story of an outlaw who rides to rescue his 13-year-old grandson from execution for an accident being treated as murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter for accidentally loading Baldwin's prop gun with a live round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baldwin's own trial spectacularly collapsed in July when it emerged that prosecutors had not turned over a batch of bullets that detectives had found during their investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Filming was halted by the fatal incident, but completed last year on location in Montana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hutchins, a former journalist who grew up in Ukraine, had been named as one of the industry's rising stars in 2019 by American Cinematographer magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the tragedy prompted some calls for banning firearms from sets altogether, new Hollywood guidelines now specify that only an armourer can hand a weapon to an actor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said Baldwin was handed the gun on set by the film's first assistant director, who later pleaded guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Souza said "the safety bulletin doesn't go quite far enough. I think they should mandate that no real weapons be used."
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Rust" premiere is not the only controversy at the festival, whosejury is presided over this year by Oscar winner Cate Blanchett.
  <br>
  <br>
  French director Coralie Fargeat pulled her movie starring Demi Moore, "The Substance" -- which won best screenplay at Cannes -- "after discovering the highly misogynistic and offensive words" of festival founder Marek Zydowicz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zydowicz was forced to apologise after appearing to suggest that including more women cinematographers might lead to "mediocre film production" in the line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remarks, for which Zydowicz later apologised, also led Oscar-winning director British director Steve McQueen, a double Oscar winner for "12 Years A Slave", to also stay away in protest at what he called the "deeply offensive words". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Thai woman was sentenced to death on Wednesday for poisoning a friend with cyanide, in the first of her 14 murder trials.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sararat Rangsiwuthaporn, 36, an online gambling addict, is accused of swindling thousands of dollars from her victims before killing them with the chemical.
  <br>
  <br>
  A court in Bangkok convicted her on Wednesday for fatally poisoning her friend Siriporn Kanwong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two met up near Bangkok in April last year to release fish into the Mae Klong river as part of a Buddhist ritual.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siriporn collapsed and died shortly afterwards and investigators found traces of cyanide in her body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were then able to link Sararat to previously unsolved cyanide poisonings going back as far as 2015, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The court's decision is just," Siriporn's mother, Tongpin Kiatchanasiri, told reporters following the verdict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to tell my daughter that I miss her deeply, and justice has been done for her today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said Sararat funded her gambling addiction by borrowing money from her victims -- in one case as much as 300,000 baht (nearly US$9,000) -- before killing them and stealing their jewellery and mobile phones.
  <br>
  <br>
  She lured 15 people -- one of whom survived -- to take poisoned "herb capsules", they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sararat faces 13 more separate murder trials, and has been charged with around 80 offences in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her ex-husband -- a police lieutenant-colonel -- was given 16 months in prison and her former lawyer two years for complicity in Siriporn's killing, the lawyer for the victim's family said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand has been the scene of several sordid and high-profile criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this year, six foreigners were found dead in a luxury Bangkok hotel after a cyanide poisoning believed to be connected to debts worth millions of baht. (AFP)

<img alt='Min Hee-jin announced her departure in a statement following what she called a "hellish dispute with HYBE". File photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780129_1_20241120194612.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean super producer behind the chart-topping girl band NewJeans resigned from her label Wednesday, following a protracted legal battle with BTS's agency HYBE that has rocked the country's K-pop industry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Min Hee-jin announced her departure in a statement following what she called a "hellish dispute with HYBE" and vowed legal action against the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The saga began in April, when HYBE launched an audit of subsidiary ADOR -- NewJeans' label -- and attempted to push Min out, accusing her of breach of trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move sparked a sprawling legal and PR battle, with Min accusing HYBE of copying her star-making formula for a competing girl band, which has seen the boardroom workings of K-pop hashed out in South Korean courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Min slammed HYBE's action against her as a "witch hunt" in a statement Wednesday, saying she would take "necessary legal actions" against the company and individuals over the dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she would embark on "new K-pop journey" in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Min, who joined the industry in the early 2000s, is widely regarded as one of the most successful producers in K-pop, having worked with stars such as Girls' Generation, EXO and SHINee.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans, a K-pop phenomenon that made its debut in 2022 and whose members are all under 20, is among HYBE's most successful K-pop groups along with BTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has topped global charts, including the Billboard 200, and broke the Guinness World Record last year for "Fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify".
  <br>
  <br>
  The members of NewJeans have publicly shown full support for Min and demanded that she be reinstated as ADOR's CEO at a livestream in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The girl group also sent a formal legal notice to HYBE last week, demanding six specific actions, including reinstating Min, and warning that failure to meet them could lead to the termination of their exclusive contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  ADOR said in a statement Wednesday that it was "regrettable that Min unilaterally notified us of her resignation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "ADOR will continue to provide our fullest support to NewJeans to help them grow and thrive even further," it said. (AFP)

    Death-row drug convict to be sent back to Philippines

<img alt="Family members of drug trafficking inmate Mary Jane Veloso hold placards pleading for help. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780123_2_20241120193418.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Wednesday that a deal has been reached for Indonesia to send home a Filipino death-row drug convict who was nearly executed by firing squad but got a reprieve due to years of pleadings from Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  Marcos thanked Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and his government for granting a longstanding Philippine request for Mary Jane Veloso to be brought back home to serve her sentence in her country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Mary Jane Veloso is coming home,” Marcos said in a statement. “Arrested in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death, Mary Jane’s case has been a long and difficult journey.”
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear when Veloso would be flown back to the Philippines, but Marcos said he looked forward to welcoming her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Law, Human Rights and Immigration, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, confirmed that Subianto has given his approval for Veloso's return to the Philippines. That may happen in December, as long as conditions were met, including her continued detention in her country as part of the Indonesian court's sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines should also shoulder the costs of her repatriation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said at a news conference in Manila that Filipino authorities would discuss the legal terms of Veloso's transfer with their Indonesian counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indonesian government has asked the Department of Justice in Manila to formally request Veloso's transfer back to the Philippines, Justice Department spokesperson Mico Clavano said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision, Marcos said, “is a reflection of the depth our nation’s partnership with Indonesia — united in a shared commitment to justice and compassion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso's transfer would remove the possibility of her facing an execution because the Philippines, Asia’s largest Roman Catholic nation, has long abolished the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2015, Indonesian authorities moved Veloso to an island prison where she and eight other drug convicts were scheduled to be executed by firing squad despite objections from the convicts' home countries, including Australia, Brazil, France, Ghana and Nigeria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia executed the eight other convicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso’s case has caused a public outcry in the Philippines, where her family and supporters contend she is innocent and was unaware that 2.6 kilograms of heroin was concealed in her suitcase. The drugs were discovered when she entered Indonesia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso travelled to Indonesia in 2010 where her godsister reportedly told her a job as a domestic worker awaited her. Her godsister also allegedly provided the suitcase where the prohibited drugs were found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine authorities had filed criminal complaints, including for human trafficking, against illegal Filipino recruiters who arranged for Veloso to work in Indonesia, Clavano said. She added that she would serve as a crucial witness in the trial of the suspects when she returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  That Philippine case helped convince Indonesian authorities to delay Veloso's execution and eventually consider her transfer back to her country, Clavano said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos said Veloso’s story resonated with many in the Philippines, as “a mother trapped by the grip of poverty, who made one desperate choice that altered the course of her life."
  <br>
  <br>
  “While she was held accountable under Indonesian law, she remains a victim of her circumstances," Marcos said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines has been a global source of manual labour, including many impoverished women who abandon their families for higher-paying jobs and better opportunities abroad. Alarming abuse, especially of Filipina house helpers, has prompted Philippine authorities to impose restrictions and safeguards but many continue to be exploited.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 59 Filipinos around the world face the death penalty mostly for drug and murder convictions, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said. (AP)

<img alt="Former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, Linda McMahon, will be tasked with leading the US Department of Education under the new Trump administration. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780049_1_20241120123007.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump nominated Linda McMahon, former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, on Tuesday to lead the Department of Education, which he has pledged to abolish.
 <br>
  <br>
  He described McMahon as a "fierce advocate for Parents' Rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  McMahon is a co-chair of Trump's transition team ahead of his return to the White House in January. It is tasked with filling some 4,000 positions in the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding McMahon's experience in education, Trump cited her two-year stint on the Connecticut Board of Education and 16 years on the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University, a private Catholic school.
  <br>
  <br>
  McMahon left WWE in 2009 to run for a seat in the US Senate, and has been a major donor to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2021, she has chaired the Centre For The American Worker at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the election campaign Trump promised to do away with the federal education department when he returns to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I say it all the time. I'm dying to get back to do this. We will ultimately eliminate the federal Department of Education," he said in September during a rally in Wisconsin.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Republican convention in Milwaukee, McMahon said she was "privileged to call Donald Trump a colleague and a boss," as well as "a friend."
  <br>
  <br>
  Her ties with Trump go back to her years in the professional wrestling industry -- she said she first met him as chief executive at WWE.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2017, she was confirmed as the head of the Small Business Administration, which is responsible for supporting America's millions of small businesses, which employ around half the country's private-sector workforce.
  <br>
  <br>
  In nominating her, Trump pointed to her experience in business, helping to grow the WWE.
  <br>
  <br>
  After leaving the administration, she served as chair of the pro-Trump America First Action SuperPAC, or political action committee. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Internet Conference officially got underway in Wuzhen of Zhejiang province on Wednesday, with President Xi Jinping calling for faster innovative and secure development of cyberspace to create a better digital future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit — the country's biggest internet forum — focuses on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking via a video link, Xi said the new technology had brought both opportunities and unpredictable challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  “New technologies, like AI, are flourishing. This has greatly enhanced humanity's capacity to understand and shape the world we live in, and at the same time presented us with a series of unpredictable risks and challenges,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China would work with other countries in information revolution and development to harness the internet’s potential for greater global benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China stands ready to work with all countries to seize the historical initiative in information revolution and development, and build a community with a shared future in cyberspace, so that together we can enable the internet to deliver greater benefits to the people and to the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang said the country's cutting-edge technologies had delivered fruitful outcomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So far, China has put in place the world's largest network infrastructure with advanced technology and the internet has been available to 78 percent of the population.” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding proposed four points for building a shared future in cyberspace, including improving global governance, strengthening tech collaboration, promoting fairness and universal benefits in internet use, and upholding laws and regulations for cybersecurity protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concluding his speech, the vice premier and Politburo Standing Committee member expressed hopes for active dialogue during the summit to build a shared future in cyberspace.
