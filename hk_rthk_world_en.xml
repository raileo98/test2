<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has expressed strong disapproval and discontent over the United States for imposing a fresh round of tariffs and cancelling a duty-free exemption on small parcels.
 <br>
  <br>
  It called on Washington to withdraw the “bullying” measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump earlier announced a raft of punishing tariffs targeting countries around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also signed an executive order to cancel a trade exemption known as "de minimis", which allows low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the country free of duties, from May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US's measures are bullying and unreasonable, and grossly inconsistent with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, willfully undermining the multilateral trading system which is the cornerstone for international trade," a Hong Kong government spokesperson said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once again, the government firmly requests the US to withdraw its so-called reciprocal tariff measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to changes to the "de minimis" exemption, the administration said Hongkong Post will temporarily maintain postal services to the US without collecting any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US until May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US has been repeatedly changing its policies unilaterally. Hongkong Post has requested the postal administration of the US to promptly clarify the matter and should not cause inconvenience to the public," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also pledged to closely monitor and assess any unilateral measures of the US that are inconsistent with fair trade, saying it will defend the city's legitimate interests by, for example, filing a complaint to the WTO.

    Australia records hottest 12 months ever

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia has just sweltered through its hottest 12 months on record, a weather official said on Thursday, a period of drenching floods, tropical cyclones and mass coral bleaching.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior government climatologist Simon Grainger said the rolling 12-month period between April 2024 and March 2025 was 1.61 degrees Celsius above average – the hottest since records began more than a century ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is certainly part of a sustained global pattern," Grainger said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been seeing temperatures since about April 2023 that were globally much warmer than anything we have seen in the global historical record."
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous hottest period was in 2019, he added, when temperatures were 1.51 degrees Celsius above average.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is a pretty significant difference," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's well above what we would expect just from uncertainties due to rounding. The difference is much larger than that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The record was measured on a rolling 12-month basis, rather than as a calendar year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia has also recorded its hottest-ever March, Grainger said, with temperatures more than two degrees above what would normally be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There has basically been sustained warmth through pretty much all of Australia," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw a lot of heatwave conditions, particularly in Western Australia. And we didn't really see many periods of cool weather – we didn't see many cold fronts come through." (AFP)

    Hungary to withdraw from ICC as Israeli leader visits

<img alt="Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) has enjoyed strong support over the years from Hungary's Viktor Orban (left). Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798838_1_20250403185544.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungary's government has decided to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, it said on Thursday, shortly after Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in the country for a state visit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited his Israeli counterpart to Budapest in November, a day after the ICC issued its arrest warrant over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, where Israel launched its offensive following an attack by Hamas-led fighters on southern Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has rejected the accusations, which it says are politically motivated and fuelled by antisemitism. It says the ICC has lost all legitimacy by issuing the warrants against a democratically elected leader of a country exercising the right of self defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a founding member of the ICC, Hungary is theoretically obliged to arrest and hand over anyone subject to a warrant from the court but Orban made clear that Hungary would not respect the ruling, which he called "brazen, cynical and completely unacceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hungary signed the ICC's founding document in 1999 and ratified it in 2001, but the law has not been promulgated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, said in November that although Hungary ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC, it "was never made part of Hungarian law," meaning that no measure of the court can be carried out within Hungary.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Gulyas told state news agency MTI that the government would launch the withdrawal process later in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orban had raised the prospect of Hungary's exit from the ICC after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court's prosecutor Karim Khan in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's time for Hungary to review what we're doing in an international organisation that is under US sanctions," Orban said on X in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill on starting the year-long process of withdrawing from the ICC is likely to be approved by Hungary's parliament, which is dominated by Orban's Fidesz party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Netherlands, which hosts the ICC, said that until withdrawal is complete, Hungary must still meet its duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The full process to withdraw from the ICC takes about a year, during that time Hungary will have to fulfil all its obligations to the court," Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp told reporters on the sidelines of a Nato meeting in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu has enjoyed strong support over the years from Hungary's Orban, an important ally who has been ready to block EU statements or actions critical of Israel in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  ICC judges said when they issued the warrant that there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and his former defence chief were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a "widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and devastated the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people and saw more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC also issued an arrest warrant against a Hamas leader in November. His death was confirmed after the warrant was issued. (Reuters)

    'Not the season' as MH370 search suspended

<img alt="Relatives of the missing MH370 passengers gather in Beijing last month on the 11th anniversary of the flight’s disappearance. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798795_1_20250403145825.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The latest search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been suspended as it is "not the season", the country's transport minister said, more than a decade after the plane went missing.
 <br>
  <br>
  "They have stopped the operation for the time being, they will resume the search at the end of this year," Transport Minister Anthony Loke said in a voice recording.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, it's not the season," Loke said in the recording, which was made during an event at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has not been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke's comments come a little over a month after authorities said the search had resumed, following earlier failed attempts that covered vast swathes of the Indian Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  An initial Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometres in the Indian Ocean over three years, but found hardly any trace of the plane other than a few pieces of debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, led an unsuccessful hunt in 2018, before agreeing to launch a new search this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether or not it will be found will be subject to the search, nobody can anticipate," Loke said, referring to the wreckage of the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said in December that a new 15,000 square kilometre area of the southern Indian Ocean would be scoured by Ocean Infinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most recent mission was conducted on the same "no find, no fee" principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if the firm finds the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of the passengers were Chinese, while the others were from Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Family members of Chinese passengers gathered in Beijing outside government offices and the Malaysian embassy last month on the 11th anniversary of the flight's disappearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some held placards asking, "When will the 11 years of waiting and torment end?" (AFP)

    Japan says tariffs may break WTO rules, deal with US

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan slammed as "extremely regrettable" US President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs, saying they may break WTO rules and the two countries' trade agreement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japanese firms are the biggest investors in the United States but Tokyo has failed to secure an exemption, with Trump announcing a hefty 24-percent levy on Japanese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have conveyed that the unilateral tariff measures taken by the United States are extremely regrettable, and I have again strongly urged [Washington] not to apply them to Japan," said Yoji Muto, trade and industry minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he spoke to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick before Trump's announcement of a new 10-percent baseline tariff and extra levies on selected countries – including close strategic ally Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan [is] very very tough. Great people.... They would charge us 46 percent, and much higher for certain items," Trump said. "We are charging them 24 percent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Muto said he had explained to Lutnick "how the US tariffs would adversely affect the US economy by undermining the capacity of Japanese companies to invest".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a frank discussion on how to pursue cooperation in the interest of both Japan and the United States that does not rely on tariffs," Muto said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi also said the US measures may contravene World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and the two countries' trade treaty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have serious concerns as to consistency with the WTO agreement and Japan-US trade agreement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if Japan will impose retaliatory tariffs or is considering filing a suit to the WTO, Hayashi said: "We decline to disclose details of our considerations." (AFP)

    Chinese rescuers fill vacuum US cuts leave in Myanmar

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After a 7.7 magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar on Friday, killing more than 2,800 people, international rescuers rushed into the devastated Southeast Asian country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The most ubiquitous among them have been Chinese relief workers, whose blue and orange uniforms appear across videos circulating on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The posts are often accompanied with expressions of gratitude toward Beijing, whose first responders – as well as their Indian and Russian colleagues – have pulled dazed survivors and bodies out from the rubble of hotels, schools, and monasteries.
  <br>
  <br>
  America's chief geopolitical rival has so far pledged to deliver 100 million yuan worth of supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first batch of aid, including tents, blankets and first aid kits arrived in Yangon on Monday, Beijing has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, which was until recently the world's top humanitarian donor, has offered a relatively modest US$2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington also said it would send a three-member assessment team, though their arrival has been delayed by problems obtaining visas from the military regime.
  <br>
  <br>
  In past years, when tsunamis, earthquakes and other disasters struck around the world, the United States had regularly and rapidly deployed skilled rescue workers to save lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American absence shows how President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the US government has hobbled its ability to act during disasters, three current and former US officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Trump's blessings, billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has enacted huge funding cuts and contractor terminations across the federal bureaucracy in the name of targeting wasteful spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also moved to fire nearly all US Agency for International Development staff, who oversee Washington's disaster response efforts overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A functional USAID would have activated urban search-and-rescue teams that were capable of being deployed to Myanmar in 48 hours, said Marcia Wong, formerly a top humanitarian official at USAID.
  <br>
  <br>
  But most of the people who would have coordinated the response have been let go, while third-party partners have lost contracts, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former US ambassador to Myanmar Scot Marciel said that while it was unlikely the junta would have allowed big US military teams to enter, Washington could still have "responded more quickly and robustly" were it not for the cuts. (Reuters)

    EU to prepare countermeasures to US reciprocal tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described US President Donald Trump's universal tariffs as a major blow to the world economy and said that the European Union was prepared to respond with countermeasures if negotiations failed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are already finalising the first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel," she said in a statement read out in Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, on Thursday ahead of an EU-Central Asia partnership summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And we're now preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier unveiled a 10 percent minimum tariff on most goods imported to the United States – with a higher 20 percent rate for the European Union – kicking into high gear a global trade war that threatens to drive up inflation and stall US and global economic growth. (Reuters)

 Beijing on Thursday said it "firmly opposes" sweeping new US tariffs on its exports, vowing "countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests".
 <br>
  <br>
  US tariffs "do not comply with international trade rules and seriously harm the legitimate rights and interests of the relevant parties", the Commerce Ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for Washington to "immediately cancel" sweeping new tariffs, warning they "endanger global economic development" and would hurt US interests and international supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the US to immediately cancel unilateral tariff measures and properly resolve differences with trade partners through equal dialogue," the ministry said, adding: "There is no winner in a trade war, and there is no way out for protectionism."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many trading partners have expressed strong dissatisfaction and clear opposition," the ministry added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday slapped a 34 percent tariff on goods from China. That's on top of the existing tax of 20 percent. (Agencies)

    'Tariffs will change global trading system'

 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday vowed to "fight" against US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which he warned will "fundamentally change the global trading system."
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's unveiling of 10 percent tariffs on imports from around the world and harsh additional levies on key trading partners ignited global anger, but for Canada the impact of the latest announcement was limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously announced US levies on Canadian steel and aluminium remain in place. Canada may also be hit hard by Trump's auto sector tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But America's northern neighbour and largest trading partner was not singled out for additional tariffs, and Canadian goods compliant with an existing North American free trade agreement appear exempt from new levies for now.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney noted that Trump's latest announcement "preserved a number of important elements of our relationship, the commercial relationship between Canada and the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister, who replaced Justin Trudeau last month, said Trump's trade war will "negatively" impact the US economy and will "directly affect millions of Canadians."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to fight these tariffs with counter measures. We are going to protect our workers," Carney said in Ottawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a crisis it is important to come together and it is essential to act with purpose and with force and that is what we will do," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week in a call with Trump, the pair agreed to discuss the future of bilateral trade after the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls currently project Carney's Liberal Party will win a majority. (AFP)

    US trade tariff 'not act of a friend': Albanese

 Donald Trump's trade tariffs on close ally Australia are "not the act of a friend" and will hurt the two nations' relationship, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Australia will however not retaliate against the announced 10-percent tariff with its own trade duties, the prime minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the act of a friend," Albanese told a news conference after Trump's tariff announcement, saying one in four Australian jobs depended on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left Australian leader, who faces a tightly contested general election on May 3, said Australia charged nothing on US imports and should face zero US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tariffs are not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has been Australia's strongest military ally since World War II, and the two countries have joined with Britain in a deal to provide Australia's navy with stealthy nuclear-powered submarines.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the new measures could change how people see their relationship, Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Australian people have every right to view this action by the Trump administration as undermining our free and fair trading relationship and counter to the shared values that have always been at the heart of our two nations long-standing friendship," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will have consequences for how Australians see this relationship," the Australian leader added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian blue-chip stocks dipped nearly two percent in early trade as one of the first global markets reacted to Trump's trade action. (AFP)

    Tesla sales slump as pressure piles on Musk

<img alt="The number of autos delivered globally dropped by 13 percent in the first three months of 2025. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798709_1_20250403033051.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla's worldwide sales tumbled in the first quarter, figures showed on Wednesday, piling further pressure on CEO Elon Musk who faces a growing backlash for his role overseeing US federal spending cuts under President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk's electric vehicle company delivered 336,681 autos globally in the first three months of 2025, a drop of 13 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quarterly figures were the lowest in nearly three years and lagged analyst expectations, as Tesla pointed to the "loss of several weeks of production" while it ramps up upgrades for its Model Y output.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla shares initially fell more than six percent, but they bounced following a news report that Trump will soon scale back Musk's involvement, viewing him as a political liability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, the world's richest person, donated some US$270 million to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump was elected, Musk launched the "Department of Government Efficiency" or Doge, which has become a lightening rod over its murky legal standing and questions about Musk's conflicts of interest and public accountability as an unelected figure driving radical change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Trump returned to the White House, Tesla has been targeted for consumer boycotts and vandalism as its chief executive has helped engineer thousands of job cuts across the US government while aggressively attacking Trump critics on the Musk-owned X social media platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wedbush's Dan Ives, a prominent technology analyst and longtime believer in Tesla's growth potential, called the figures "a disaster on every metric," according to a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a fork in the road moment," said Ives, who has called for Musk to publicly outline how he is balancing his Tesla commitments with his work for Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The more political he gets... the more the brand suffers, there is no debate. This quarter was an example of the damage Musk is causing Tesla," he added, calling early 2025 "a moment of truth" for Musk and his car company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ives and other long-term Tesla bulls have viewed the EV maker as poised for potentially massive growth, viewing Musk as a guru in state-of-the-art autonomous driving and artificial intelligence technology expected to play a growing role for the foreseeable future. (AFP)

    Myanmar junta declares quake ceasefire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's junta announced a temporary ceasefire on Wednesday as the death toll from a devastating earthquake rose and desperate survivors pleaded for more help amid frantic scenes of aid distribution.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shallow 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday flattened buildings across Myanmar, killing nearly 3,000 people and making thousands more homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military government said it would observe a ceasefire from Wednesday until April 22 to make quake relief efforts easier, after other armed groups fighting the country's bloody four-year civil war made similar pledges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups and several foreign governments had earlier condemned the junta for continuing to carry out air strikes even as the country grappled with the quake aftermath.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta said in a statement the ceasefire had "the aim of speeding up relief and reconstruction efforts, and maintaining peace and stability".
  <br>
  <br>
  But it warned its opponents - a complex array of pro-democracy and ethnic minority armed groups - it would still respond to attacks, acts of sabotage or "gathering, organising, and expanding territory that would undermine peace".
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta also said leader Min Aung Hlaing will travel to Bangkok on Thursday for a summit of South Asian countries plus Myanmar and Thailand, where he will discuss the quake response. (AFP)

    Trump unveils sweeping global tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled a raft of punishing tariffs targeting countries around the world including some of its closest trading partners, in a move that risks sparking a ruinous trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in the White House Rose Garden against a backdrop of US flags, Trump slapped the most stinging tariffs on China and the European Union on what he called "Liberation Day."
  <br>
  <br>
  The dollar fell one percent against the euro and slipped against other major currencies as Trump was speaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump reserved some of the heaviest blows for what he called the "nations that treat us badly", including 20 percent on key ally the European Union and 24 percent on Japan.  He also slapped 34 percent on goods from China, on top of the existing tariff of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 78-year-old Republican – who held up a chart with a list of levies – said that he was "very kind" and so was only imposing half the amount that those countries taxed US exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the rest, Trump said he would impose a "baseline" tariff of 10 percent, including Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  An audience of cabinet members, as well as workers in hard hats from industries including steel, oil and gas, whooped and cheered as Trump said the tariffs would "make America wealthy again."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is Liberation Day," Trump said, adding that it would "forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House told reporters that a "baseline" 10 percent tariff would start on 12:01am EST on April 5, while higher rates on various partners would begin from 12:01am EST on April 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Washington correspondent Simon Marks said many nations would now be looking to strike deals with Trump's administration to reduce the tariffs' impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Trump's] definitely left the door open for all sorts of nations to try an negotiate with him to come and beseech him to step back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no question that Donald Trump is now presiding over the most protectionist US government that the world has seen since the 1930s," Marks added. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Israel to seize 'large areas' of Gaza

<img alt="Israel carries out deadly air strikes in southern and central Gaza. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798686_1_20250402213633.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel said on Wednesday it would expand its military operations and seize "large areas" of the Gaza Strip where rescuers said 34 people were killed in Israeli strikes, including on a United Nations building.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel would bolster its military presence in the Palestinian territory to "destroy and clear the area of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure".
  <br>
  <br>
  The operation would "seize large areas that will be incorporated into Israeli security zones", he said in a statement, without specifying how much territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least 19 people were killed, including nine children, when an Israeli strike "targeted an UNRWA (UN agency for Palestinian refugees) building housing a medical clinic in Jabalia refugee camp".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army said in a statement that it struck Hamas militants "inside a command and control centre" in north Gaza's Jabalia. It separately confirmed the building housed a UN clinic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian foreign ministry, based in the occupied West Bank, condemned the "massacre at the UNRWA clinic in Jabalia" and called for "serious international pressure" to halt Israel's widening offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has on several occasions conducted strikes on UNRWA buildings housing displaced people in Gaza, where fighting has raged for most of the past 18 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military accuses Hamas of hiding in school buildings where thousands of Gazans have sought shelter – a charge denied by the Palestinian militant group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel also carried out deadly air strikes in southern and central Gaza on Wednesday. The civil defence said dawn strikes killed at least 13 people in Khan Yunis and two in Nuseirat refugee camp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz warned last week that the military would soon "operate with full force" in more parts of Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February, he announced plans for an agency to oversee the "voluntary departure" of Palestinians from the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  That followed Israel's backing of a proposal from US President Donald Trump for the United States to take over the territory after relocating its 2.4 million Palestinian inhabitants. The proposal outraged Gazans and drew widespread international condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 before launching a new ground offensive, ending a nearly two-month ceasefire. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescue teams from the SAR and the mainland have joined hands in finding a survivor in the quake-rattled Myanmar city of Mandalay.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 52-year-old man had been trapped in the rubble of a hotel for more than 120 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint rescue came five days after the earthquake, beyond what is typically considered the critical "golden" period for finding survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was found in stable condition and has been transferred to local medical facilities for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the ninth survivor rescued by the national team since their deployment to Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, security minister Chris Tang expressed gratitude to members of both the national and SAR squads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, who led the 51-strong SAR team, said they spared no effort in the search and rescue work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The team will grasp every opportunity, never give up and do its best to find the remaining survivors," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Singaporean teenager allegedly planning to kill dozens of Muslims outside several mosques has been detained, the city-state's Internal Security Department (ISD) said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 17-year-old boy was detained in March, the ISD said in a statement, adding that he had regarded white supremacist Brenton Tarrant – who in 2019 had killed worshippers at mosques in New Zealand – as a "hero".
  <br>
  <br>
  ISD also said he had "identified as an 'East Asian supremacist'", and had decided on five mosques across Singapore for his post-Friday prayer attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This boy wanted to kill at least 100 Muslims, so that he can kill more Muslims than Tarrant had killed. He also wanted to live-stream his attacks," Home Minister K Shanmugam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he was arrested... he had already made a number of attempts to get a gun. He told ISD quite openly if he had gotten a gun, he would have carried out his attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The teen had been in online contact with 18-year-old Nick Lee, who was detained in December for having similar plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The multicultural country has seen several cases in recent years where young Singaporeans have been detained for allegedly making attack plans following exposure to extremist content online.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, authorities arrested a teenage boy who was allegedly planning an Islamic State group-inspired stabbing attack at a busy suburb.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same statement Wednesday, the ISD also said a 15-year-old girl was placed under a restriction order in February, forbidding her from travelling nor having access to the internet without the approval of the ISD director.
  <br>
  <br>
  It alleged that between July 2023 and December 2024, the girl was in at least eight short-term romantic online relationships with overseas-based Islamic State group supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She went to pledge allegiance to an ISIS chatbot," said Shanmugam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She wanted to fight and die for ISIS, she looked up flights to go to Syria, she thought of how she was going to save money to plan for her travels."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the trend of rising radicalism and extremism of young people via the internet was "concerning".
  <br>
  <br>
  ISD said "self-radicalisation can happen very quickly".
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the case of the 15-year-old, it only took weeks," it said, appealing for the public to "be vigilant to signs". (AFP)

 China strongly urges all parties in Myanmar to ensure the safety of earthquake relief workers and supplies from China and other countries, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In response to a query at a daily press briefing, Guo Jiakun said relief supplies provided by the Red Cross Society of China have arrived in Myanmar and are on their way to the disaster-stricken area of Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, relief workers and supplies are safe," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after Myanmar's junta said earlier in the day that its troops had fired warning shots when a Chinese Red Cross convoy failed to stop while approaching a conflict area to deliver aid to earthquake victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group of nine vehicles was approaching Ommati village in northern Shan State on Tuesday night, and failed to stop when signalled by soldiers, junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a distance of around 200 metres, security forces used a light to try to halt them but they did not stop," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The security forces fired three gunshots aiming at the sky."
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid and rescue workers have been coming in to Myanmar, including from its close ally China, since Friday's 7.7-magnitude quake, which has killed close to 2,800 people and left thousands homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  But access to the worst-hit areas has been hindered by wrecked roads, poor telecommunications and ongoing violence between the junta and rebel militias.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zaw Min Tun said the convoy belonged to the Chinese Red Cross and that the junta was investigating the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shan state has been the scene of intense fighting between the junta and ethnic minority armed groups which have seized control of large areas of territory. (AFP/Xinhua)

 China on Wednesday warned the Philippines against threatening "regional peace" after the United States said it had approved the possible sale of US$5.58 billion in F-16 fighter jets to Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Philippines' defence and security cooperation with other countries should not target any third party or harm the interests of a third party," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nor should it threaten regional peace and security or exacerbate regional tensions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department said it was green-lighting a sale that includes 20 F-16 jets and related equipment to the Philippines, a treaty-bound ally of the United States. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's embassy in Bangkok called on the country's companies operating abroad to comply with local laws after a Chinese construction firm came under scrutiny over a deadly building collapse in Friday's earthquake.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 30-storey skyscraper, set to house Thai government offices, collapsed in Bangkok when a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck neighbouring Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to investigate where the mistake happened," said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who has ordered a probe into the materials used at the construction site and its safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What happened from the beginning since it was designed?" she said earlier. "How was this design approved? This was not the first building in the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The development near Bangkok's popular Chatuchak market was a joint project involving China Railway No 10 Engineering Group (Thailand), an offshoot of China Railway Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Thailand late on Tuesday expressed "deepest condolences" for the collapse and urged firms to "strictly" comply with Thai laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government has consistently urged Chinese companies overseas to abide by local laws and contribute positively to the society," it said in a Facebook post only in Thai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has dispatched a team of rescue experts and disaster relief personnel to assist in Bangkok and vowed to "continue supporting Thailand as needed", it added. (AFP)

    Seoul braces for clashes over Yoon ruling

<img alt="Police officers get ready for a potential showdown on Friday between pro and anti-Yoon supporters near the entrance of the Constitutional Court in Seoul. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798612_1_20250402141524.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police will mobilise "all available resources" to prevent violence when a court rules on Friday on the fate of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, with top tourist sites to close and embassies warning citizens to stay away.
 <br>
  <br>
  The country's Constitutional Court will issue a ruling on whether to strip Yoon of office over his abortive declaration of martial law, which has already seen him suspended by lawmakers and arrested on insurrection charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court in downtown Seoul has become a flashpoint, with near-constant protests in the area until the police moved on Tuesday to seal off the streets to head off possible clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation has become more grave than ever," Lee Ho-young, acting chief of the Korean National Police Agency, said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of thousands of people for and against Yoon have poured onto Seoul's streets every weekend, with die-hards on each side also setting up tent camps and staging all-night protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are concerned that whatever verdict is announced, some people "may become agitated and engage in extreme or violent protests", said Lee during a meeting with top police officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's supporters stormed a court building in January after a judge extended the suspended president's detention. He was later released from custody on procedural grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police will mobilise all available resources to ensure the safety of the public and to prevent the situation from escalating into serious social conflict," said Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Seoul, more than 14,000 riot police will be deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen nearby schools and several shops in the neighbourhood will close on the day of the verdict due to safety issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major tourist sites such as the Gyeongbok and Changdeok palaces, within walking distances from the court, will also be shuttered, the Korean Heritage Service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Seoul warned its nationals to keep away from local political protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do not participate, do not linger, do not watch," it posted on its social media channels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do not publicly express or forward political comments, and try to avoid verbal or physical confrontations with local people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting President Han Duck-soo urged political leaders to refrain from making remarks that could incite or encourage illegal protests or violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regardless of the outcome, we must calmly and rationally accept the court's decision," he said during a meeting with ministry officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is a time to prioritise the stability and survival of our community over political advantages or disadvantages," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon is stripped of office by the court, it will trigger elections which must be held within 60 days. (AFP)

 Rescuers on Wednesday pulled a man alive from the rubble five days after Myanmar's devastating earthquake, as calls grew for the junta to allow more aid in and halt attacks on rebels.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shallow 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday flattened buildings across Myanmar, killing more than 2,700 people and making thousands more homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several leading armed groups fighting the military have suspended hostilities during the quake recovery, but junta chief Min Aung Hlaing vowed to continue "defensive activities" against "terrorists".
  <br>
  <br>
  UN agencies, rights groups and foreign governments have urged all sides in Myanmar's civil war to stop fighting and focus on helping those affected by the quake, the biggest to hit the country in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of finding more survivors are fading, but there was a moment of joy on Wednesday as a man was pulled alive from the ruins of a hotel in the capital Naypyidaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old hotel worker was extracted by a joint Myanmar-Turkish team shortly after midnight, the fire service and junta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dazed and dusty but conscious, the man was pulled through a hole in the rubble and put on a stretcher, video posted on Facebook by the Myanmar Fire Services Department shows. (AFP)

    Actor Val Kilmer loses bout with pnemonia

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American actor Val Kilmer, who was first propelled to fame with "Top Gun" and went on to starring roles as Batman and Jim Morrison, has died at age 65, the New York Times reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The cause of death was pneumonia, his daughter Mercedes Kilmer told the Times on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said he had been diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014 and later recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally a stage actor, Kilmer got his start on the big screen with Cold War spoof "Top Secret!" in 1984.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two years later, he gained fame as the cocky, if mostly silent aviator Iceman in "Top Gun", playing a rival to Tom Cruise's Maverick.
  <br>
  <br>
  A versatile actor whose career spanned decades, Kilmer got a shot at leading man roles in Oliver Stone's "The Doors" and took a turn as the masked Gotham vigilante in "Batman Forever", playing Bruce Wayne after Michael Keaton and before George Clooney.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kilmer was the youngest person ever accepted to New York's fabled Juilliard school and longed to make serious films. But he found himself in a series of schlocky blockbusters and expensive flops in the early 2000s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chastened by a decade or more of low-budget movies, he was mounting a comeback in the 2010s with a successful stage show about Mark Twain that he hoped to turn into a film, when he was struck by cancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Val", a documentary about his stratospheric rise and later fall in Hollywood showed him rasping for air, premiered at the Cannes film festival in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kilmer recently returned to movie theaters in 2021 with a cameo reprising his role as Iceman in "Top Gun: Maverick", the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 hit. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sydney beachfront properties were flooded and coastal infrastructure damaged after a large swell combined with a king tide to batter the Australian shore, officials said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Several homes were evacuated at Botany Bay in Sydney’s south around midnight as waves surged across the coast, according to New South Wales State Emergency Service spokesman Andrew Edmunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further north at Sydney’s premier Bondi Beach, the coast was lashed by a 5.5-metre swell, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Windows were shattered at Bondi Icebergs Swimming Club, a waterfront pool, gymnasium and restaurant complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV footage showed waves bursting through glass doors after 11 pm on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It has just been devastating,” club general manager Bob Tate said.
  <br>

    Trump-backed candidate loses Wisconsin court election

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Democratic-backed candidate for Wisconsin Supreme Court defeated a challenger endorsed by US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, touting her victory as a win against powerful interests and cementing a liberal majority for at least three more years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Susan Crawford, a Dane County judge who led legal fights to protect union power and abortion rights and to oppose voter ID, stood on stage surrounded by the court's four current liberal justices and celebrated her win as a victory for democracy while also taking a dig at Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I would be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said. “And we won.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and groups he backed had spent more than US$21 million in an effort to defeat Crawford. Musk even traveled to Wisconsin two days before the election to personally hand over US$1 million checks to two voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Today Wisconsinites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our Supreme Court,” Crawford said in her victory speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price, our courts are not for sale.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford defeated Republican-backed Brad Schimel in a race that broke records for spending, was the highest-turnout Wisconsin Supreme Court election ever and became a proxy fight for the nation’s political battles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk was silent on his X platform in the wake of Crawford’s victory, reposting a message about Vietnam and tariffs but nothing on the Supreme Court contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, Musk and other Republicans lined up behind Schimel, a former state attorney general.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats including former president Barack Obama and billionaire megadonor George Soros backed Crawford .
  <br>
  <br>
  The first major election in the country since November was seen as a litmus test of how voters feel about Trump’s first months back in office and the role played by Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency has torn through federal agencies and laid off thousands of workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk traveled to Wisconsin on Sunday to make a pitch for Schimel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford was beating Schimel by more than eight points, based on unofficial results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turnout exceeded 52 percent of the voting age population, topping the record set in 2023 of nearly 40 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spending was on its way to surpass US$100 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schimel told his supporters he had conceded to Crawford, leading to yells of anger. One woman began to chant, “Cheater, cheater!”
  <br>
  <br>
  “No,” Schimel said. “You’ve got to accept the results.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The court can decide election-related laws and settle disputes over future election outcomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford embraced the backing of Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights advocates, running ads that highlighted Schimel’s opposition to the procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also attacked Schimel for his ties to Musk and Republicans, referring to Musk as “Elon Schimel” during a debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schimel’s campaign tried to portray Crawford as weak on crime and puppet of Democrats who, if elected, would push to redraw congressional district boundary lines to hurt Republicans and repeal a GOP-backed state law that took collective bargaining rights away from most public workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voters in Eau Claire seemed to respond to both messages. Jim Seeger, a 68-year-old retiree, said he voted for Schimel because he was concerned about redistricting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim Hazelton, a 68-year-old disabled veteran, said he had planned to abstain but voted for Crawford after Musk, whom he called a “pushy billionaire”,  and Trump got involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s cutting everything,” Hazelton said of Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People need these things he’s cutting.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford’s win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority, as it has been since 2023. A liberal justice is not up for election again until April 2028, ensuring liberals will either maintain or increase their hold on the court until then.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford thanked each of the current liberal justices and hugged each of them after her win. One of the four is retiring, creating the open seat she won.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court likely will be deciding cases on abortion, public sector unions, voting rules and congressional district boundaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Who controls the court also could factor into how it might rule on any future voting challenge in the perennial presidential battleground state, which raised the stakes of the race for national Republicans and Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump endorsed Schimel just 11 days before the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year the court declined to take up a Democratic-backed challenge to congressional lines, but Schimel and Musk have said that if Crawford won, the court would redraw congressional districts to make them more favorable to Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Milwaukee, 22-year-old college student Kenneth Gifford said he feels that Trump has done damage to American institutions and that Musk is trying to buy votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want an actual, respectable democracy,” he said. (AP)

    US senator makes record books with 25-hour talk-a-thon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Democratic US lawmaker shattered a record for the longest speech in Senate history, staying on his feet for more than 25 hours to deliver a fiery protest against President Donald Trump's "unconstitutional" actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senator Cory Booker's display of endurance – to hold the floor he had to remain standing and could not even go to the bathroom – recalled the famous scene in Frank Capra's 1939 film classic "Mr Smith Goes to Washington."
  <br>
  <br>
  The longest Senate speech on record before Booker's feat on Tuesday was delivered by South Carolina's Strom Thurmond, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker, only the fourth Black senator to be popularly elected to the body, blew past that deadline, his voice still strong but emotional as he topped out at 25 hours and five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public galleries of the Senate chamber gradually filled as the moment he broke the record approached, with more Democratic lawmakers joining the session – although Republicans largely stayed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a moral moment. It's not left or right. It's right or wrong," Booker said as he wrapped up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also quoted his mentor John Lewis, a 1960s civil rights movement leader, who urged campaigners to get into "good trouble," before finally pronouncing "Madam President, I yield the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 55-year-old New Jersey native had found a moment for some humour as he passed the record, joking: "I want to go a little bit past this and then I'm going to deal with some of the biological urgencies I'm feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of people gathered outside the US Capitol brandishing signs with messages like "Thank you Senator Booker."
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Booker's talk-a-thon was not actually blocking the majority Republican Party from holding votes in the Senate, as would be the case in a true filibuster, his defiance quickly became a rallying point for beleaguered Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker, a former presidential candidate, seized command in the chamber at 7 pm on Monday (7 am Hong Kong time on Tuesday) and finished at 8:05 pm on Tuesday (8:05 am on Wednesday).
  <br>
  <br>
  He lashed out at Trump's radical cost-cutting policies that have seen his top advisor Elon Musk, the world's richest person, slash entire government programs without consent from Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The senator said Trump's aggressive seizing of ever-more executive power had put US democracy at risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unnecessary hardships are being borne by Americans of all backgrounds," Booker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And institutions which are special in America, which are precious and which are unique in our country, are being recklessly – and I would say even unconstitutionally – affected, attacked, even shattered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In just 71 days the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans' safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he had words of encouragement for Trump opponents, saying as he concluded that "the power of the people is greater than the people in power."
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker later went into detail about how he withstood the physical demands of the speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My strategy was to stop eating. I think I stopped eating Friday and then to stop drinking the night before I started on Monday," he said in the Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  The approach "had its benefits and had its really downsides... different muscle groups start to really cramp up" with dehydration, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement sent by his office, Booker added that he was "tired and a little hoarse."
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic lawmakers, in the minority in both the Senate and House of Representatives, have struggled over how to blunt Trump's efforts to downsize government, ramp up deportations and shred much of the country's political norms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just want to thank you for holding vigil for this country all night," Senator Raphael Warnock told Booker on the floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker dedicated much of his speech to criticizing Trump's policies, but to pass the time he also recited poetry, discussed sports and entertained questions from colleagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you love your neighbor, if you love this country, show your love. Stop them from doing what they're trying to [do]," he said. (AFP)

    Mass layoffs at major US health agencies

<img alt='US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said "Americans are getting sicker every year". File photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798553_1_20250402090430.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mass layoffs began at the major US health agencies on Tuesday as the Trump administration embarks on a sweeping and scientifically-contested restructuring that will cut 10,000 jobs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said the layoffs were part of a major reform of his department, aiming to refocus efforts on chronic disease prevention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling it a "difficult moment for all of us," Kennedy said "our hearts go out to those who have lost their jobs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the reality is clear: what we've been doing isn't working," he added, complaining that "Americans are getting sicker every year" despite increasing spending at the federal agencies guiding US health policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to photos and testimonials posted on social media, employees learned of their dismissal early on Tuesday morning by email or by having their access badges not working when they showed up to work in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The layoffs affect the Department of Health and Human Services and the federal agencies it oversees, such as those in charge of approving new drugs (FDA), responding to epidemics (CDC) or medical research (NIH).
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US media reports, several senior officials from these agencies, including Jeanne Marrazzo, who had replaced Anthony Fauci as head of one of the NIH's branches, have been offered reassignment to isolated locations in Alaska or Oklahoma.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FDA as we've known it is finished, with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed," said Robert Califf, a former FDA commissioner during the Obama and Biden administrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move comes despite the country facing its worst measles outbreak in years and mounting fears that bird flu could spark the next human pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy has alarmed health experts with his rhetoric downplaying the importance of vaccines and even suggesting that avian influenza should be allowed to spread freely among America's poultry. (AFP)

    Volcano erupts in southwestern Iceland

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A volcano in southwestern Iceland - that has erupted repeatedly for more than a year - again belched lava and smoke into the air on Tuesday, just hours after authorities evacuated the few remaining residents of a nearby fishing village.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eruption began at 9:45 am local time, triggering warning sirens in the town of Grindavik where webcams showed molten rock spewing toward the community. It had subsided by late afternoon, though the volcano was still active, Iceland's Met Office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police and civil defence officials evacuated Grindavik and the Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, one of Iceland’s biggest tourist attractions, after an early morning earthquake swarm suggested an eruption was imminent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The community, located on the Reykjanes Peninsula, was largely evacuated in November 2023 when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for some 800 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 homes were evacuated on Tuesday, though police reported that some residents refused to leave their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Those individuals who choose to remain in the town don't seem to consider that I have 50 people involved in this operation, some of whom are volunteers,” Ulfar Luovíksson, police commissioner in South Iceland, told local broadcaster RUV. “I would ask that more consideration be shown towards civil defence.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Iceland sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic . The most disruptive incident in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flights were not affected by Tuesday's eruption. (AP)

    Trump 'perfecting' tariffs with hours to go

<img alt='White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing that the tariffs would take effect "immediately" after the announcement. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798530_1_20250402033307.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump kept the world's leading economies on edge on Tuesday as he made final preparations for a "Liberation Day" announcement of sweeping new tariffs that could trigger a global trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised to be "very kind" when he unveils the so-called reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday, but uncertainty reigned over which countries would be targeted and by how much.
  <br>
  <br>
  His plan has prompted vows of retaliation from major economies - including the European Union and Canada - and fears that it could unleash a recession at home and abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Trump had "made a decision" but was still putting the finishing touches on the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is with his trade and tariff team right now, perfecting it to make sure this is a perfect deal for the American people and the American worker," Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House would not confirm reports in US media that Trump was considering across-the-board tariffs of around 20 percent, rather than different amounts for different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leavitt said the tariffs would take effect "immediately" after the announcement, meaning there would be no time for foreign leaders to negotiate carve-outs before they start.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican billionaire, a fan of tariffs for decades, indicated on Monday night that the tariffs would be lower than what other countries would be charging the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to be very nice, relatively speaking, we're going to be very kind," he said in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics warn that the strategy risks a global trade war, provoking a chain reaction of retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  America's trading partners have been preparing to respond, even as they continue efforts to make last-minute negotiations with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to be very deliberate in terms of the measures we take, to fight for Canada," Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who spoke to Trump last week, said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union, which Trump has accused of trying to "screw" the United States, said on Tuesday it still hoped to negotiate a solution - but that "all instruments are on the table" to retaliate if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with Trump on "productive negotiations" towards a UK-US trade deal. Vietnam said on Tuesday it would slash duties on a range of goods to appease Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The president is always up to take a phone call, always up for a good negotiation," Leavitt said. (AFP)

<img alt="Marine Le Pen on Monday was given a prison term and fine after being convicted of a fake jobs scheme at the EU parliament. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798529_1_20250402032757.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A French appeals court said on Tuesday it would examine Marine Le Pen's case within a timeframe that could potentially allow the far-right leader to contest the 2027 presidential election if her conviction is overturned.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a court ruling many commentators called a political earthquake, Le Pen on Monday was given a prison term and fine after being convicted of a fake jobs scheme at the EU parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the most serious part of the conviction was a five-year ban - effective immediately - on standing for office, which eliminates her from the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing her lawmakers on Tuesday, Le Pen, who considered herself the favourite in the 2027 election in which President Emmanuel Macron cannot stand again, accused "the system" of rolling out "the nuclear bomb" to end her presidential hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they use such a powerful weapon against us, it's obviously because we're about to win an election," said Le Pen, 56. "We won't let this happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris Court of Appeal said later on Tuesday that it would examine Le Pen's case "within a timeframe that should allow a decision to be reached in the summer of 2026".
  <br>
  <br>
  This could mean that the new trial would be held by early 2026 at the latest, and that the decision would therefore be handed down well before the 2027 presidential election, in which Le Pen wants to run for the fourth time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement signed by the chief justice, Jacques Boulard, and the attorney general, Marie-Suzanne Le Queau, the court said it had received three appeals against the rulings handed down on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was made after Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin, speaking during a tense parliament session, expressed hope that Le Pen's appeal would be heard within the "most reasonable timeframe".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I personally hope that if Mrs Le Pen lodges an appeal, this new judgement at the Paris Court of Appeal can take place within the most reasonable timeframe," Darmanin told parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the court decision could deepen France's political crisis and cast a shadow on the upcoming 2027 polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen's National Rally (RN), which is the largest single party in parliament, can complicate life for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, who does not have a majority in the lower house National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Le Pen loses her appeal, there is also a "plan B", a candidacy by her protege and RN party leader Jordan Bardella, a 29-year-old with a slick television and social media presence. (AFP)

    Far-right party chief calls for rally over Le Pen ban

<img alt="Marine Le Pen with Jordan Bardella at the Elysee presidential palace in Paris in August. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798485_1_20250401174939.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far-right party chief Jordan Bardella called on the French to rally this weekend to protest against a ruling that banned Marine Le Pen from running for public office for five years after being found guilty of embezzling European Union funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monday's ruling was a catastrophic setback for Le Pen, the long-time National Rally (RN) leader, who had been the front-runner in opinion polls for the 2027 presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe today that the French must be outraged, and I tell them: Be outraged!" Bardella told Europe 1 radio and CNews TV over a ruling that far-right leaders said was biased and undemocratic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll take to the streets this weekend. We're organising leaflet distributions, democratic, peaceful, calm mobilisations," he said, without giving details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bardella could become the RN's de facto candidate for the 2027 election. But Le Pen suggested she was not yet ready to hand him the baton, saying on Monday: "I'm not going to let myself be eliminated like this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bardella backed her on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she would appeal as soon as possible against what she described as a politicised ruling aimed at blocking her presidential bid. Le Pen has run three times for president and had said 2027 would be her final run for top office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge in the court hearing on Monday, Benedicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been "at the heart" of a scheme to misappropriate more than 4 million euros (US$4.3 million) of EU funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lack of remorse by Le Pen and other defendants was among reasons that prompted the court to ban them from running for office with immediate effect, de Perthuis said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was given a four-year prison sentence - two years of which are suspended and two years to be served under home detention - and a 100,000-euro (US$108,200) fine, but they will not apply until her appeals are exhausted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appeals in France can take months or even years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants were not accused of pocketing the money but rather of using it illegally to pay the party's staff back home instead of EU parliamentary assistants. They denied wrongdoing and said the money was used legitimately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite outrage over the ruling among the far right in France, Europe and beyond who were joined in their condemnation of what they called judicial overreach, an opinion poll showed a majority of French people agreed with the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some politicians, including former Socialist President Francois Hollande, said it was important to respect the independence of the judicial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifty-seven percent of those interviewed by Elabe pollsters said the ruling was normal considering what Le Pen was accused of, while 42 percent considered it was politically biased.
  <br>
  <br>
  The poll, carried out for BFM TV, also showed that 42 percent of voters were happy with the ruling, with 29 percent unhappy - while 29 percent did not care.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Emmanuel Macron and his minority, centre-right government were yet to react officially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the ruling, mainstream politicians including Prime Minister Francois Bayrou had said they were ill at ease with the idea that any ban on Le Pen could be enforced immediately and stop her from running in 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the streets of Paris, and in Le Pen's stronghold of Henin-Beaumont, in northern France, reactions were mixed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a shame, it's a shame because we needed a different president, we needed the RN to win," 56-year-old resident Pascal Walkowiak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another resident, 60-year-old Isabelle, said: "Too bad for her. I think it's a good thing because she made mistakes. And well, there you go, she can't represent us, actually." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Aid groups in the worst-hit areas of Myanmar said there was an urgent need for shelter, food and water after an earthquake that killed more than 2,700 people, but said the country's civil war could prevent help reaching those in need.
 <br>
  <br>
  The death toll had reached 2,719 and is expected to rise to more than 3,000, Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing said in a televised address on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 4,521 people were injured, and 441 were missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7 magnitude quake, which hit around lunchtime on Friday, was the strongest to hit the Southeast Asian country in more than a century, toppling ancient pagodas and modern buildings alike.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring Thailand, rescuers pressed on with searching for life in the rubble of a collapsed skyscraper in Bangkok, but acknowledged time was against them.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar's Mandalay area, 50 children and two teachers were killed when their preschool collapsed, said the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the hardest-hit areas ...communities struggle to meet their basic needs, such as access to clean water and sanitation, while emergency teams work tirelessly to locate survivors and provide life-saving aid," the UN body said in a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Rescue Committee said shelter, food, water and medical help were all needed in places such as Mandalay, near the epicentre of the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having lived through the terror of the earthquake, people now fear aftershocks and are sleeping outside on roads or in open fields," an IRC worker in Mandalay said in a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The civil war in Myanmar, where the junta seized power in a coup in 2021, has complicated efforts to reach those injured and made homeless by the Southeast Asian nation's biggest quake in a century.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amnesty International said the junta needed to allow aid to reach areas of the country not under its control. Rebel groups say the junta has conducted airstrikes after the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Myanmar's military has a longstanding practice of denying aid to areas where groups who resist it are active," Amnesty's Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It must immediately allow unimpeded access to all humanitarian organisations and remove administrative barriers delaying needs assessments."
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta's tight control over communication networks and the damage to roads, bridges and other infrastructure caused by the quakes have intensified the challenges for aid workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai officials said a meeting of regional leaders in Bangkok this week would go ahead as planned, although the junta's Min Aung Hlaing may attend by teleconference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the quake struck, sources said the junta chief had been expected to make a rare foreign trip to attend the summit in Bangkok on Thursday and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar's capital Naypyitaw, rescue workers saved a 63-year-old woman from the rubble of a building on Tuesday, but hope was fading of finding many more survivors of the violent earthquake, compounding a humanitarian crisis caused by a bloody civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Myanmar fire department in the Naypyitaw said the woman was successfully pulled from the rubble early on Tuesday, 91 hours after being buried when the building collapsed in the 7.7 magnitude earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake's epicenter was near the country's second-largest city Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those figures are widely expected to rise, but the earthquake hit a wide swath of the country, leaving many areas without power, telephone or cell connections and damaging roads and bridges, leaving the full extent of the devastation hard to assess.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the reports so far have come from Mandalay and Naypyitaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization said overall, more than 10,000 buildings are known to have collapsed or been severely damaged in central and northwest Myanmar. (Reuters/AP)

    Three killed in Beirut as Israel targets top militant

<img alt="The airstrike targeted a Hezbollah militant in the top three floors of a building in south Beirut. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798455_1_20250401160916.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least three people were killed and seven wounded in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs on Tuesday, the Lebanese health ministry said, further testing a shaky four-month ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said in a statement that it attacked a Hezbollah militant "who had recently directed Hamas operatives and assisted them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack took place a few days after a previous strike by Israel on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, a Hezbollah stronghold known as the Dahiyeh.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate statement from Hezbollah on the identity of the target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the latest Israeli airstrike, calling it a "dangerous warning" that signals premeditated intentions against Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aoun said Israel's growing "aggression" requires Lebanon to intensify diplomatic outreach and mobilise international allies in support of the country's full sovereignty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam also condemned the Israeli strike and said it was a flagrant breach of UN Resolution 1701 and the ceasefire arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nawaf said that he has been closely monitoring the aftermath of the strike in coordination with the ministers of defence and interior.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike appeared to have damaged the upper three floors of a building in Beirut's southern suburbs, with the balconies of those floors blown out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The glass on the floors below was intact, indicating a targeted strike. Ambulances were at the scene to recover casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no evacuation warning issued for the area ahead of the strike, and families fled in the aftermath to other parts of Beirut, according to witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  November's ceasefire agreement halted the year-long conflict and mandated that southern Lebanon be free of Hezbollah fighters and weapons, that Lebanese troops deploy to the area and that Israeli ground troops withdraw from the zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  But each side accuses the other of not entirely living up to those terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-brokered truce has looked increasingly flimsy lately. Israel delayed a promised troop withdrawal in January and said that it had intercepted rockets fired from Lebanon in March, which led it to bombard targets in Beirut's southern suburbs and southern Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Iran-aligned Hezbollah has denied any involvement in the rocket firings. (Reuters)

    Australia hit by floods in inland area size of France

<img alt="A homestead is inundated by floodwaters near the town of Jundah in south-west Queensland. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798443_1_20250401145343.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Whole herds of cattle have drowned in vast inland floods sweeping across the Australian outback, officials said on Tuesday, as the muddy tide drenched an area the size of France.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swollen rivers burst their banks after unusually heavy downpours last week over outback Queensland, an arid region home to some of the country's largest cattle ranches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said more than 100,000 livestock – cattle, sheep, goats and horses – had been swept away, were missing, or had drowned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are only early indications of the magnitude of this disaster and while these preliminary numbers are shocking, we are expecting them to continue to climb as flood waters recede," said state agriculture minister Tony Perrett.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's heartbreaking to consider what western Queenslanders will be going through over the weeks and months as they discover the full extent of losses and damage – and start the long slog to start again."
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers have repeatedly warned that climate change amplifies the risk of natural disasters such as bushfires, floods and cyclones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flood waters stretched some 500,000 square kilometres across sparsely populated western Queensland, Perrett said, a landmass roughly equivalent to France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry body AgForce told local media some cattle ranches may have lost almost 100 percent of their herd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government Bureau of Meteorology said some towns had recorded as much as 500 millimetres of rain in the space of a week – their typical yearly total.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, more rainfall is on the way," forecaster Dean Narramore said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reason why we are so concerned about that is because we have numerous flood warnings current for much of Queensland."
  <br>
  <br>
  Muddy livestock survived by crowding together on the few small hills cresting above the flood waters, photos posted to social media showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Queensland's fire department used helicopters to drop bales of fodder near surviving animals cut off from food.
  <br>
  <br>
  The state's primary industries department said some 4,000 kilometres of road had been flooded – a distance greater than the famed Route 66 connecting Chicago to Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rising waters on Tuesday morning encircled the remote outpost of Thargomindah, which describes itself as Australia's farthest town from the sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  A makeshift dirt flood levy was dug around the town to protect its 200 residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preparations are well under way, including securing food deliveries, ensuring the airport has enough aircraft fuel and if need be an evacuation point and accommodation," the shire council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our shire's isolated properties are stocked with food and supplies and doing okay under the circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's so-called "channel country" is one of the nation's biggest cattle fattening grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the time its sweeping plains are dry and inhospitable.
  <br>
  <br>
  But cattle gorge themselves on the pastures that sprout whenever wet season rains fill the dry creek beds – or channels – that snake through the region. (AFP)

<img alt="At the CinemaCon in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas are, from left, Sam Mendes, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn, Barry Keoghan and Harris Dickinson. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798436_1_20250401134811.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sam Mendes will release four movies about The Beatles in the same month, the director has announced, with Paul Mescal playing Paul McCartney and Harris Dickinson portraying John Lennon in "the first bingeable theatrical experience."
 <br>
  <br>
  The "four-film cinematic event," hitting theaters in April 2028, will each focus on a different member of the legendary British pop quartet, with Barry Keoghan playing Ringo Starr and Joseph Quinn as George Harrison.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each one is told from the particular perspective of just one of the guys," Mendes told the CinemaCon movie theater convention in Las Vegas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They intersect in different ways – sometimes overlapping, sometimes not.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're four very different human beings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But together, all four films will tell the story of the greatest band in history."
  <br>
  <br>
  Filming is about to begin, and is expected to take more than a year, said Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact order in which the movies will be released has not yet been revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'd been trying to make a film about the Beatles for years, but I had temporarily given up," explained "American Beauty" Oscar-winner Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just felt the story of the band was too huge to fit into a single movie, and that turning it into a TV mini-series just somehow didn't feel right."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came at the start of the CinemaCon trade convention, where movie theater owners gather annually in Las Vegas to hear Hollywood studios' plans for the coming months and years.
  <br>
  <br>
  While 2025 had been widely touted as the year that the movie industry would bounce back, the box office has so far endured a terrible start, reeling from high-profile flops like Disney's live-action "Snow White" and sci-fi "Mickey 17."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US$1.3 billion taken in North America receipts so far is seven percent below an already lean first quarter of last year, which was itself derailed by the previous year's massive Hollywood strikes. (AFP)

 A massive fire caused by a gas pipeline leak forced people from their homes and injured more than 100 during Eid celebrations near Malaysia's capital on Tuesday, fire officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inferno, which was visible kilometres away, was caused by "a gas pipeline leak stretching approximately 500 metres," said fire officials in Selangor state near Kuala Lumpur.
  <br>
  <br>
  The valve to the affected pipeline belonging to Malaysia's state-run oil firm Petronas has been shut off, the fire officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the early morning blaze was coming under control in the afternoon, more than 100 people were injured, the fire department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 60 of the injured were hospitalised, Selangor deputy police chief Mohamad Zaini Abu Hassan was quoted as saying by local broadcaster Astro Awani.
  <br>
  <br>
  No deaths were reported but about 50 houses were affected by the blaze, the fire department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents were enjoying a public holiday for Eid celebrations in Muslim-majority Malaysia when they were forced to flee the suburban area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nizam Mohamad Asnizam, 49, who lives 100 metres from the site of the fire, fled from his house with his family in his car.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I woke up, I saw the fire raging, with an extraordinary sound. I have never experienced a fire with this kind of sound. The sound was terrifying. It felt like a jet engine was next to me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stepping on the floor was like stepping on a hot wok. The heat was like putting your head in an oven, it felt like I was burning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dashcam footage shared online showed a column of fire from what appears to be an explosion, creating a massive fireball that shot into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another video shared online showed a residential area covered in smoke while a huge fire blazed in the background. Singed trees and melted cars are also seen in the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selangor Chief Minister Amirudin Shari said in a Facebook post that a temporary relief centre had been set up at a nearby mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  He warned the public to stay away from the area affected by the fire while investigations and rescue work were being carried out. (AFP)

<img alt="Sales of Tesla EVs are slowing in Europe amid a growing backlash against its CEO Elon Musk over his political views. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798413_1_20250401120524.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla investors are bracing for a drop in first-quarter vehicle deliveries as a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's politics exacerbates weakening demand for the electric vehicle maker's lineup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk promised Tesla would return to growth this year after its annual deliveries fell for the first time in 2024, and Wall Street will be watching to see how a refreshed Model Y SUV and incentives made a difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla has been grappling with rising global competition and mass protests against Musk's role overseeing cuts to federal spending as an adviser to US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>

   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's San Francisco correspondent Mark Niu said dismay at Musk's government cutbacks plus disdain towards his personal politics was affecting Tesla's business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's certainly has taken a toll on Tesla's stock [price] which rose sharply when Donald Trump won the election with Musk being his biggest financial backer. It hit a record of US$480 and today it's around US$259  ... with regard to sales one thing is quite clear: sales of new Tesla cars have slumped in Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company has been offering discounts and other incentives, including low-cost financing, but these seemed to have had little impact in Europe, where sales declined in the first two months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of China-made Teslas fell as well. Chinese rivals including BYD have ramped up a price war and launched at least six models in the past year to take on the Model Y. (Reuters)

<img alt="SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket carries the four commercial astronauts into a 90-degree inclination polar orbit on the Fram2 mission after launching from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798408_1_20250401112340.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A bitcoin investor who bought a SpaceX flight for himself and three polar explorers has blasted off on the first rocket ride to carry people over the North and South poles .
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Chun, a Chinese-born entrepreneur, hurtled into orbit on Monday night from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX’s Falcon rocket steered southward over the Atlantic, putting the space tourists on a path never flown before in 64 years of human spaceflight .
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang won’t say how much he paid Elon Musk’s SpaceX for the three-and-a-half day ultimate polar adventure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first leg of their flight – from Florida to the South Pole – took barely half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the targeted altitude of some 440 kilometres, their fully automated capsule will circle the globe in roughly one-and-a-half  hours, including 46 minutes to fly from pole to pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Enjoy the views of the poles. Send us some pictures,” SpaceX Launch Control radioed once the capsule reached orbit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang has already visited the polar regions in person and wants to view them from space.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trip is also about “pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge,” he said ahead of the flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now a citizen of Malta, he took along three guests: Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge and Australian polar guide Eric Philips.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikkelsen, the first Norwegian bound for space, has flown over the poles before, but at a much lower altitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was part of the 2019 record-breaking mission that circumnavigated the world via the poles in a Gulfstream jet to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s moon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crew plans two dozen experiments – including taking the first human X-rays in space – and brought along more cameras than usual to document their journey called Fram2 after the Norwegian polar research ship from more than a century ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until now, no space traveler had ventured beyond 65 degrees north and south latitude, just shy of the Arctic and Antarctic circles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first woman in space, the Soviet Union’s Valentina Tereshkova, set that mark in 1963. Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and other pioneering cosmonauts came almost as close, as did NASA shuttle astronauts in 1990.
  <br>
  <br>
  A polar orbit is ideal for climate and Earth-mapping satellites as well as spy satellites.
  <br>
  <br>
  That’s because a spacecraft can observe the entire world each day, circling Earth from pole to pole as it rotates below.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geir Klover, director of the Fram Museum in Oslo, Norway, where the original polar ship is on display, hopes the trip will draw more attention to climate change and the melting polar caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lent the crew a tiny piece of the ship's wooden deck that bears the signature of Oscar Wisting, who with Roald Amundsen in the early 1900s became the first to reach both poles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang pitched the idea of a polar flight to SpaceX in 2023, two years after US tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman made the first of two chartered flights with Musk’s company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaacman is now in the running for NASA’s top job.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX's Kiko Dontchev said late last week that the company is continually refining its training so “normal people” without traditional aerospace backgrounds can “hop in a capsule ... and be calm about it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang and his crew view the polar flight as like camping in the wild and embrace the challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Spaceflight is becoming increasingly routine and, honestly, I’m happy to see that,” Wang said via X last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said he's been counting up his flights since his first one in 2002, flying on planes, helicopters and hot air balloons in his quest to visit every country.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, he’s visited more than half.
  <br>
  <br>
  He arranged it so that liftoff would mark his 1,000th flight. (AP)

    Bangkok reviews construction safety in quake aftermath

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities said they were investigating why a single office tower block under construction in Bangkok collapsed during Friday's earthquake that otherwise caused limited damage in the capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok governor Chadchart Sittipunt visited the site on Monday as heavy equipment pulled away rubble from the 30-storey State Audit Office building in hopes of finding the 78 people still missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even one life saved is worth all the effort, so I think we have to move on, carry on,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the longer run it's important to ensure building safety in the city, where millions of people live and work in thousands of high-rise buildings, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The magnitude 7.7 quake, which was centred more than 1,200 km away, killed more than 2,000 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, most of them at the Bangkok construction site near the popular Chatuchak Market.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we need to find the root cause so at least we can learn some lessons and improve building regulations," Chadchart said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the end, we will have some results that will improve safety in Bangkok.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in the property developer handling the project, Italian Thai Development, fell 27 percent in trading on Monday as questions were raised about the building's design, enforcement of construction safety codes, and the Chinese contractor building the State Audit Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, whose family owns one of Thailand’s largest construction conglomerates, said he has ordered an investigation committee to be set up and to report the results back to him within seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed to three possible factors behind the collapse: the designer, the inspectors or the builders. (AP)

    Impeachment crunch time for Yoon on Friday

<img alt="Yoon Suk-yeol will learn whether he has the top job in South Korea come Friday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798397_1_20250401101622.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s Constitutional Court said it will rule on whether to formally dismiss or reinstate impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It has been deliberating on Yoon’s political fate over his ill-fated imposition of martial law that triggered a massive political crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The won reversed earlier losses to turn higher against the US dollar after the announcement of the ruling date.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market's benchmark KOSPI was up 1.5 percent after the announcement of the ruling, after pairing earlier gains to 0.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court, which currently has eight justices with one seat vacant, can decide to oust Yoon only when six or more judges agree, according to South Korea's constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whatever decision is, it will likely deepen domestic divisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millions have rallied in Seoul and elsewhere to support or denounce Yoon in the past few months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they’ll mobilise all available personnel to preserve order and respond to acts of vandalism, arson and assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition-controlled liberal National Assembly in December voted to impeach Yoon, a conservative, leaving his political fate in the hands of the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is facing a separate criminal trial after he was arrested and indicted by prosecutors in January on rebellion charges in connection with his December 3 martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court’s endorsement of Yoon’s impeachment would officially drive him out of office and prompt a national election within two months to find a new president.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it overturns Yoon’s impeachment, he would immediately return to his presidential duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the heart of the matter is Yoon’s decision to send hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after imposing martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has insisted that he aimed to maintain order, but some military and military officials have said Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to frustrate a floor vote on his decree and detain his political opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon argues that he didn’t intend to maintain martial law for long, and he only wanted to highlight what he called the “wickedness” of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda, impeached senior officials and slashed his budget bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his martial law announcement, he called the assembly “a den of criminals” and “anti-state forces.”
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, a president has the right to declare martial law in wartime or other emergency situations, but the Democratic Party and its supporters say South Korea wasn’t in such a situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Party-led impeachment motion accused Yoon of suppressing parliament's activities, attempting to detain politicians and others and undermining peace in violation of the constitution and other laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has said he had no intention of disrupting National Assembly operations and detaining anyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s martial law lasted only six hours because lawmakers managed to enter the assembly and vote to strike down his decree unanimously.
  <br>
  <br>
  No violence erupted, but live TV footage showing armed soldiers arriving at the assembly invoked painful memories of past military-backed dictatorships. It was the first time for South Korea to be placed under martial law since 1980. (AP/Reuters)

    Myanmar to mark minute of silence for quake victims

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar will mark a minute of silence on Tuesday in tribute to victims of the country's devastating earthquake that has killed more than 2,000 people, as hopes dim of finding more survivors in the rubble of ruined buildings.
 <br>
  <br>
  National flags will fly at half-mast until April 6 "in sympathy for the loss of life and damages" from Friday's massive quake, the ruling junta said in a statement on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of a week of national mourning, the junta announced the minute's silence to begin Tuesday at 12:51:02 pm - the precise time the 7.7-magnitude quake struck.
  <br>
  <br>
  People should stop where they are to pay respect to the victims, the junta said, while media should halt broadcasting and show mourning symbols, and prayers will be offered at temples and pagodas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the tempo and urgency of rescue efforts wound down in Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country's second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta said Monday that 2,056 have now been confirmed dead, with more than 3,900 people injured and 270 still missing, but the toll is expected to rise significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three Chinese nationals are said to be among the dead, along with two French people.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 19 deaths have been confirmed hundreds of kilometres away in Thailand's capital Bangkok, where the force of the quake caused a 30-storey tower block under construction to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diggers continue to clear the vast pile of rubble at the site, where a dozen deaths have been confirmed and at least 75 people are still unaccounted for. Officials say they have not given up hope of finding more survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States said on Monday it had dispatched a disaster relief team to Myanmar, defending the pace of the deployment following President Donald Trump's dismantling of America's main overseas aid agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake struck on Friday, on the same day that Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was formally dissolving the US Agency for International Development (USAID), arguing that the "gains were too few and the costs were too high," after cutting more than 80 percent of its projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, Russia and India have already sent teams to Myanmar. (AFP)

  <br>
  SpaceX recently ferried the duo home after more than nine months at the International Space Station, filling in for Boeing, which returned to Earth without them last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In their first news conference since coming home, the pair said they were taken aback by all the interest and insisted they were only doing their job and putting the mission ahead of themselves and even their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore didn't shy from accepting some of the blame for Boeing's bungled test flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ll start and point the finger and I’ll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide,” he told reporters. “All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Both astronauts said they would strap into Starliner again. “Because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work,” Wilmore said, adding he'd go back up “in a heartbeat.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams noted that Starliner has “a lot of capability” and she wants to see it succeed. “We're all in,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two will meet with Boeing leadership on Wednesday to provide a rundown on the flight and its problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not for pointing fingers,” Wilmore said. “It's just to make the path clearer going forward.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The longtime astronauts and retired Navy captains ended up spending 286 days in space - 278 days more than planned when they blasted off on Boeing’s first astronaut flight on June 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test pilots had to intervene in order for the Starliner capsule to reach the space station, as thrusters failed and helium leaked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their space station stay kept getting extended as engineers debated how to proceed. NASA finally judged Starliner too dangerous to bring Wilmore and Williams back and transferred them to SpaceX. But the launch of their replacements got stalled, stretching their mission beyond nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dragged-out drama finally ended two weeks ago with a flawless splashdown by SpaceX off the Florida Panhandle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa said engineers still do not understand why Starliner’s thrusters malfunctioned; more tests are planned through the summer. If engineers can figure out the thruster and leak issues, “Starliner is ready to go," Wilmore said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The space agency may require another test flight - with cargo - before allowing astronauts to climb aboard. That redo could come by year's end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Starliner’s rocky road, Nasa officials said they stand behind the decision made years ago to have two competing US companies providing taxi service to and from the space station. But time is running out: The space station is set to be abandoned in five years and replaced in orbit by privately operated labs. (AP)

    Trump task force to review Harvard's funding

 Harvard University has become the latest target in the Trump administration’s approach to fight campus anti-semitism, with the announcement of a new “comprehensive review” that could jeopardise billions of dollars for the Ivy League college.
 <br>
  <br>
  A federal anti-semitism task force is reviewing more than US$255 million in contracts between Harvard and the federal government to make sure the school is following civil rights laws, the administration announced on Monday. The government also will examine US$8.7 billion in grant commitments to Harvard and its affiliates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The same task force cut US$400 million from Columbia University and threatened to slash billions more if it refused a list of demands from President Donald Trump's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Columbia agreed to many of the changes this month, drawing praise from some Jewish groups and condemnation from free speech groups, who see it as a stunning intrusion by the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of other universities have been put on notice by the Trump administration that they could face similar treatment over allegations of anti-semitism. The federal government is a major provider of revenue for American universities through grants for scientific research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education Secretary Linda McMahon said Harvard symbolises the American Dream, but has jeopardised its reputation by “promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry” and failing to protect students from anti-semitism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard President Alan Garber acknowledged that anti-semitism exists even on his campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but he said Harvard has done much to fight it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard will ensure the government has a full account of the university's work, Garber said. If federal funding is pulled, he added, it will “halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's renewed offensive in Gaza has reportedly left at least 322 children dead and 609 wounded in the Palestinian territory in the past 10 days, UNICEF said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figures include children who were reportedly killed or wounded when the surgical department of Al Nasser Hospital, in southern Gaza, was hit in an attack on March 23, the UN children's agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  UNICEF said most of these children were displaced, and sheltering in makeshift tents or damaged homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ending a nearly two-month ceasefire in the war with Hamas, Israel resumed intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 and then launched a new ground offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire in Gaza provided a desperately needed lifeline for Gaza's children and hope for a path to recovery," said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But children have again been plunged into a cycle of deadly violence and deprivation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell added: "All parties must adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect children."
  <br>
  <br>
  The UNICEF statement said that after nearly 18 months of war, more than 15,000 children have reportedly been killed, over 34,000 reportedly injured, and nearly one million children have been displaced repeatedly and denied basic services.
  <br>
  <br>
  UNICEF called for an end to hostilities and for Israel to end its ban on humanitarian aid entering Gaza, which has been in force since March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said children who are sick or wounded should be evacuated to receive medical attention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Food, safe water, shelter, and medical care have become increasingly scarce. Without these essential supplies, malnutrition, diseases and other preventable conditions will likely surge, leading to an increase in preventable child deaths," UNICEF said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world must not stand by and allow the killing and suffering of children to continue," it added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI on Monday said it raised US$40 billion in a new funding round that valued the ChatGPT maker at US$300 billion, the biggest capital-raising session ever for a startup.
 <br>
  <br>
  The infusion of cash comes in a partnership with Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group and "enables us to push the frontiers of AI research even further," the San Francisco-based company said in a post on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their support will help us continue building AI systems that drive scientific discovery, enable personalised education, enhance human creativity, and pave the way toward AGI (artificial general intelligence) that benefits all of humanity," the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AGI refers to a computing platform with human-level intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank said in a release that it is on a mission to realise Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that surpasses human intelligence, and that OpenAI is the partner closest to achieving that goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advancement of OpenAI's AI models is key to achieving AGI and ASI, and massive computing power is essential," SoftBank stated in its rationale for the latest investment in the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank is to pump US$10 billion into OpenAI to start, and US$30 billion more by the end of this year pending certain conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI plans to scale its infrastructure and "deliver increasingly powerful tools for the 500 million people who use ChatGPT every week." (AFP)

    Trump will 'be kind' over further tariffs this week

<img alt="US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798346_1_20250401021518.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said Monday he would be "very kind" to trading partners when he unveils further tariffs this week, risking global turmoil to address what he says are unfair trade imbalances.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump - who has been making unprecedented use of presidential powers since taking office in January - said he could announce as early as Tuesday night exactly what "reciprocal tariffs" will be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican billionaire insists that reciprocal action is needed because the world's biggest economy has been "ripped off by every country in the world," promising "Liberation Day" for the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could also unveil more sector-specific levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for details, he told reporters Monday: "You're going to see in two days, which is maybe tomorrow night or probably Wednesday."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added: "We're going to be very nice, relatively speaking, we're going to be very kind."
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics warn that the strategy risks a global trade war, provoking a chain reaction of retaliation by major trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already, China, South Korea and Japan agreed on Sunday to strengthen free trade between themselves, ahead of Trump's expected tariff announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said on Monday that he was not worried his action would push allies toward Beijing, adding that a deal on TikTok could also be tied to China tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, President Trump downplayed risks that TikTok was in danger of being banned in the United States, saying he was confident of finding a buyer for the app's US business by a Friday deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has over 170 million American users, is under threat from a law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner ByteDance or face a ban in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican president quickly announced a delay that has allowed it to continue to operate; that delay is set to expire on April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of potential buyers. There's tremendous interest in TikTok," Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One late Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of people that want to buy TikTok. We're dealing with China also on it, because they may have something to do with it," he said, adding "I'd like to see TikTok remain alive." (AFP)

<img alt="US President Donald Trump (Left) earlier criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin for the lack of progress on a ceasefire deal. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798328_1_20250331211156.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday said that President Vladimir Putin was still "open" to speaking to Donald Trump after the US president said he was "very angry" with the Russian leader over little progress on a ceasefire in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier criticised both Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, as he pushes to end more than three years of conflict in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told NBC he was "pissed off" at Putin for questioning Zelensky's credibility as someone to negotiate with and for calling for new authorities in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The president remains open to contact with President Trump," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing call.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there was no phone call scheduled between the two leaders, but that one could be "organised promptly" if deemed "necessary".
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin earlier this month rejected a US proposal of an unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, that Zelensky backed, and has upped his rhetoric on Moscow wanting to install new leadership in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are continuing work.. Firstly, on developing bilateral relations and also working on implementing some ideas, linked to resolving the Ukrainian (conflict)," Peskov said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Work is ongoing. There is nothing concrete yet. This process is time-consuming, probably due to the fact of the complexity of the substance," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, NBC News journalist Kristen Walker said Trump had called her to say he was angry with Putin and threatened tariffs on firms dealing with Russian oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later said he was "disappointed" with Putin for his comments on Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's supposed to be making a deal with him, whether you like him or you don't like him," Trump said. (AFP)

    Tokyo updates toll for next potential 'megaquake'

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The Fukushima nuclear disaster was one of three 2011 chain of events that changed the way that Tokyo traditionally regarded the 'megaquake' scenario. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798306_1_20250331182035.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A "megaquake" and subsequent tsunami could cause up to 298,000 deaths in Japan and damage costing up to US$2 trillion, the government said on Monday in a new estimate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figures have been updated from a previous estimate, made in 2014, for the potential consequences of a huge earthquake along the Nankai Trough south of Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 800-kilometre undersea trench runs from Shizuoka, west of Tokyo, to the southern tip of Kyushu island.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is where the Philippine Sea oceanic tectonic plate is "subducting" –  or slowly slipping – underneath the continental plate that Japan sits atop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plates become stuck as they move, storing up vast amounts of energy that is released when they break free, causing potentially massive earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cabinet Office's disaster management working group said up to 215,000 people would be killed by a tsunami, 73,000 by the collapse of buildings and 9,000 by fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the predicted toll as a whole is lower than the 2014 estimate that said up to 323,000 people would die.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past 1,400 years, megaquakes in the Nankai Trough have occurred every 100 to 200 years. The last one happened in 1946.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say it is extremely difficult to predict quakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in January, a government panel said the probability of such a megaquake in the next 30 years has marginally increased, with a 75-82 percent chance of it happening.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued its first "megaquake advisory" under rules drawn up after the devastating 2011 earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the likelihood of a new major earthquake along the Nankai Trough was higher than normal after a magnitude 7.1 jolt in southern Japan that injured 14 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advisory was lifted after a week but caused shortages of rice and other staples as people replenished their emergency stocks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A French court on Monday banned far-right leader Marine Le Pen from running for office after her conviction over a fake jobs scheme, specifying that the sanction should come into force with immediate effect even if an appeal is lodged.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ruling could mean that Le Pen will not be able to stand for president in 2027 elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  She left the courtroom after her conviction and this sanction were announced, but before the judge announced rulings on a potential prison sentence and fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court had earlier in the day found Le Pen guilty of misappropriating EU funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen, head of the far-right National Rally, is the front-runner in opinion polls ahead of the 2027 vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors had asked that Le Pen face an immediate five-year ban from public office if found guilty, regardless of any appeal process, using a so-called "provisional execution" measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  An automatic five-year ban would hammer Le Pen, 56, a three-time presidential contender who has said 2027 will be her final run for top office.
  <br>
  <br>
  She would retain her parliamentary seat until the end of her mandate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen has accused prosecutors of seeking her "political death," alleging a plot to keep the National Rally from power that echoes claims made by US President Donald Trump about his legal woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen, the National Rally and two dozen party figures were accused of diverting European parliament funds to pay France-based party staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants said the money was used legitimately and the allegations define too narrowly what a parliamentary assistant does.
  <br>
  <br>
  However judge Benedicte de Perthuis ruled: "It was established that all these people were actually working for the party, that their [European Union] lawmaker had not given them any tasks."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The investigations also showed that these were not administrative errors ... but embezzlement within the framework of a system put in place to reduce the party's costs."  (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's ruling junta declared a week of national mourning on Monday for the country's devastating earthquake, which has killed more than 1,700 people, as hopes faded of finding more survivors in the rubble of ruined buildings.
 <br>
  <br>
  National flags will fly at half-mast until April 6 "in sympathy for the loss of life and damages" from Friday's massive 7.7-magnitude quake, the junta said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the tempo and urgency of rescue efforts wound down in Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country's second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation is so dire that it's hard to express what is happening," said Aung Myint Hussein, chief administrator of Mandalay's Sajja North mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  People camped out in the streets across Mandalay overnight, either unable to return to ruined homes or nervous about the repeated aftershocks that rattled the city over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some had tents but many, including young children, simply bedded down on blankets in the middle of the roads, trying to keep as far from buildings as possible for fear of falling masonry.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,700 people are confirmed dead across Myanmar, according to the military junta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands more were injured and more than 300 remain missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 18 deaths have been confirmed hundreds of kilometres away in Bangkok, where the force of the quake caused a 30-storey tower block under construction to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, with communications down in much of Myanmar, the true scale of the disaster has yet to emerge and the death toll is expected to rise significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mandalay's 1,000-bed general hospital has been evacuated, with hundreds of patients being treated outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  With temperatures forecast to hit 40 degrees Celsius on Monday, patients lay on gurneys in the hospital car park, many with only a thin tarpaulin rigged up to shield them from the fierce tropical sun.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives did their best to comfort them, holding hands or waving bamboo fans over them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very, very imperfect condition for everyone," said one medic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're trying to do what we can here. We are trying our best."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sticky heat has exhausted rescue workers and accelerated body decomposition, which could complicate identification.
  <br>
  <br>
  But traffic began returning to the streets of Mandalay on Monday, and restaurants and street vendors resumed work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of Muslims gathered outside a destroyed mosque in the city for the first prayer of Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that follows the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aftershocks rattled Mandalay over the weekend, several times sending residents fleeing into the streets in brief moments of panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The challenges facing the Southeast Asian country of more than 50 million people were immense even before the earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar has been ravaged by four years of civil war sparked by a military coup in 2021, with its economy shattered and healthcare and infrastructure badly damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization declared the quake a top-level emergency as it urgently sought US$8 million to save lives and prevent disease outbreaks over the next 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has launched an appeal for more than US$100 million to help victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid and rescue teams have been arriving after junta chief Min Aung Hlaing made an exceptionally rare appeal for foreign assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past, isolated Myanmar's ruling generals have shunned foreign assistance, even after major natural disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun thanked key allies China and Russia for their help, as well as India, and said the authorities were doing their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Bangkok, rain fell on Monday morning at the site of the collapsed building, where diggers continued to clear the vast pile of rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say they have not given up hope of finding more survivors in the wreckage, where 11 deaths have been confirmed and at least 76 people are still unaccounted for. (AFP)

    US tariffs to target 'all countries'

<img alt="Donald Trump arrives back at the White House. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798259_1_20250331152712.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said the tariffs he plans to impose in the coming days would include "all countries," not just those with the largest trade imbalances with the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised a "Liberation Day" on Wednesday, when he is set to unveil reciprocal levies to address trade practices that his government deems unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You'd start with all countries, so let's see what happens," he said onboard Air Force One, dashing hopes he might scale back some of the threatened levies or that they would target a select group with persistent trade imbalances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't heard a rumor about 15 countries, 10 or 15," he said when asked which nations would be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been talking about all countries, not a cutoff."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's upcoming tariff salvo had been expected to target the 15 percent of partners that have persistent trade imbalances with the United States, a group Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called a "Dirty 15."
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite widening the target, the president insisted his tariffs would be more "generous" than those levied against the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tariffs will be far more generous than those countries were to us, meaning they will be kinder than those countries were to the United States of America over the decades," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They ripped us off like no country has ever been ripped off in history and we're going to be much nicer than they were to us.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it's substantial money for the country nevertheless."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has already slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and additional levies on imports from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tariffs on imported autos are also due to take effect on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's top trade aide Peter Navarro said the tax on auto imports could raise US$100 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And in addition, the other tariffs are going to raise about US$600 billion a year, about US$6 trillion over a 10-year period," Navarro said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's plans to unleash a wide range of reciprocal tariffs risk a global trade war, with other countries already vowing to retaliate and economists warning the sweeping moves risk stoking inflation and triggering a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has defended the levies as a way to raise government revenue and revitalize US industry. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police plan to question a 56-year-old man on suspicion of starting at least one of the wildfires that recently devastated the country’s southern regions, killing 30 people and burning through more than 48,000 hectares.
 <br>
  <br>
  The North Gyeongsang provincial police department said the unidentified man may have used fire to clear overgrown grass at a family grave on a hill in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the areas hardest hit by the wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police investigators examined the grave site on Monday and plan to question the man soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police department did not immediately say whether others would also be questioned over suspected links to the wildfires, which fire officials believe may have been sparked by multiple human errors, also including burning trash and sparks from welding work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fueled by dry and windy conditions, the wildfires raged for a week, destroying thousands of homes, and leaving mountains covered in ash, before firefighters, aided by rain, brought them under control on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30 people killed were mostly in their 60s or older.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during firefighting efforts and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 45 people were injured, including nine seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires damaged or destroyed more than 6,000 structures, including over 1,000 homes each in the southeastern city of Andong and the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, as well as more than 330 homes in Uiseong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires in Uiseong damaged about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, said to have been originally built in the seventh century.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them were two state-designated “treasures,” a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668 and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king. (AP)

 Rescuers from China have found six survivors so far in earthquake-rattled Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The China Search and Rescue Team plucked to safety three women and a girl on Monday morning in Mandalay. One of the women is pregnant.
  <br>
  <br>
  That raised to six the number of survivors found by Chinese rescuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 91 personnel from five civilian emergency response forces organised by the Ministry of Emergency Management have arrived in Myanmar and have been taking part in rescue operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the first batch of disaster-relief material offered by Beijing arrived in Myanmar on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar said one Chinese national was killed and 15 other Chinese citizens were injured in Friday's tremor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy said the Chinese diplomatic missions in Myanmar have been assisting the families of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,700 people were killed in the quake. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    Trump 'not joking' about bid for third term

<img alt="Donald Trump chats with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, left, on board Marine One upon arrival at the White House on Sunday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798236_1_20250331125457.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said “I’m not joking” about trying to serve a third term, the clearest indication he is considering ways to breach a constitutional barrier against continuing to lead the country after his second term ends at the beginning of 2029.
 <br>
  <br>
  “There are methods which you could do it,” he said in a telephone interview on Sunday with NBC News from Mar-a-Lago, his private club.
  <br>
  <br>
  He elaborated later to reporters on Air Force One from Florida to Washington that "I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged.” Trump lost that election to Democrat Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Trump added: “I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, we’ve got a long time to go.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22nd amendment, added to the Constitution in 1951 after President Franklin D Roosevelt was elected four times in a row, says “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Any attempt to remain in office would be legally suspect and it is unclear how seriously Trump might pursue the idea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments nonetheless were an extraordinary reflection of the desire to maintain power by a president who had violated democratic traditions four years ago when he tried to overturn the election he lost to Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy," said a statement from Rep. Daniel Goldman, a New York Democrat who served as lead counsel for Trump's first impeachment. "If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump’s ambitions for a third term.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Bannon, a former Trump strategist who runs the right-wing “War Room” podcast, called for the president to run again during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kayla Thompson, a 30-year-old former paralegal in Wisconsin, said she would “absolutely” like Trump to serve another term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “America needs him. America is headed in the right direction and, if he doesn’t do it, we’re probably headed backwards," said Thompson, who was attending a campaign event on Sunday with Elon Musk in Green Bay for a state Supreme Court race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Boston’s Northeastern University, said "there are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NBC's Kristen Welker asked Trump if one potential avenue to a third term was having Vice President JD Vance run for the top job and “then pass the baton to you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, that’s one,” Trump responded. “But there are others too. There are others.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Can you tell me another?” Welker asked.
  <br>
  <br>
  “No,” Trump replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, noted that the 12th amendment, which was ratified in 1804, says “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Muller said that indicates that if Trump is not eligible to run for president again because of the 22nd amendment, he is not eligible to run for vice president, either.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked whether he would want to keep serving in “the toughest job in the country” at that point.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, I like working,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump suggested that Americans would go along with a third term because of his popularity. He falsely claimed to have “the highest poll numbers of any Republican for the last 100 years.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Gallup data shows President George W Bush reaching a 90 percent approval rating after the attacks on September 11, 2001. His father, President George H.W. Bush, hit 89 percent following the Gulf War in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has maxed out at 47 percent in Gallup data during his second term, despite claiming to be "in the high 70s in many polls, in the real polls.” (AP)

    Duterte lawyer insists ICC 'has no jurisdiction'

<img alt="Friends and relatives of some of the thousands killed during former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's 'war on drugs' call for justice and his conviction by the International Criminal Court in Manila on Friday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798229_1_20250331121432.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodrigo Duterte's lead lawyer said there was a "compelling" argument to throw out the International Criminal Court case against the former Philippines president before it even comes to trial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nicholas Kaufman said in an interview in The Hague he hoped to stop the case before the ICC confirms the charges against Duterte by arguing the court cannot exercise its jurisdiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Philippines' withdrawal from the court had become effective well before an investigation was authorised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte, 80, faces a charge of crimes against humanity for murder over his "war on drugs" that claimed the lives of thousands of mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  British-Israeli lawyer Kaufman, 56, said: "Coming back to the jurisdictional point, obviously you don't need to be the dean of a law faculty to realise that that's going to be a huge issue at pre-trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that the jurisdictional argument is compelling as defence counsel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that it should succeed and I would be hugely disappointed if it doesn't succeed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to persuade the judges pre-trial that it [the court] cannot exercise its jurisdiction over the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There won't be a confirmation-of-charges hearing if the judges rule in our favour."
  <br>
  <br>
  A confirmation of charges hearing, where prosecutor and defence first lay out their evidence, is currently scheduled for September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The issue of jurisdiction is key in this case as the Philippines withdrew from the ICC in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, when the court issued its arrest warrant for Duterte, it noted that the alleged crimes took place while the country was still an ICC member.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the alleged conduct has taken place between 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019 on the territory of the Philippines, it falls within the court's jurisdiction," the ICC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC chief prosecutor's application for his arrest said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population" in the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The families of victims of his war on drugs see the ICC case as a long-awaited chance for justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another likely critical issue for the defence will be Duterte's arrest on March 11 and his rapid handover to the ICC in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I view it as a kidnapping, nothing more or less. It's an extrajudicial rendition. He was given no due process, just slung over to the Hague," Kaufman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was in complete contravention of Philippines law."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president's sudden detention came amid a spectacular deterioration in relations between the two most powerful families in Philippines politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Duterte and Marcos clans teamed up to win an election landslide in 2022 that saw Ferdinand Marcos become president and Sara Duterte, daughter of the imprisoned Rodrigo, vice-president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte has since been impeached on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Duterte "should have been brought before a judge before he was thrown onto a plane and dumped in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That didn't happen. As I've said already, this is a political hit job," said Kaufman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The politics in that country basically ended up in a situation where they needed to get him out of the picture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incumbent government did not want him in the picture anymore."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaufman said he was visiting his client virtually every day in the ICC detention centre, a couple of kilometres from the beach in the suburb of Scheveningen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was "adjusting to the reality of prison life. That's not easy for anyone," according to his lawyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the former president was in "good spirits," said Kaufman, whose previous clients at ICC include former Congolese rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba and Aisha Kadhafi, daughter of the deceased Libyan dictator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaufman said he was concerned that the ICC, currently under fire from all sides and even US sanctions, would be reluctant to give up such a high-profile case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My only fear is that this court is starved of cases at the present moment and might be loath to let a case like that go, to slip through its hands." (AFP)

    Venezuela says high-level criminal among US deportees

<img alt="Repatriation flight with migrants deported from the US lands in at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798190_1_20250331090008.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelan authorities reported the arrival on Sunday of a new flight of 175 migrants expelled by the United States, including a gang leader - the first time Caracas has confirmed a criminal was among the deportees.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has launched a crackdown on migrants since coming to power in January, deporting hundreds of people to Latin America that his administration has branded as "gangsters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the first time in these flights... someone of weight arrives who has been claimed by the Venezuelan justice system," said Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that the man was "not from Tren de Aragua," referring to the Venezuelan gang that Washington branded a "foreign terrorist organisation" and claims many of the deported Venezuelan migrants belong to.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabello received the migrants at the Maiquetia International Airport that serves Caracas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He belongs to a gang from Trujillo state, the gang... El Cagon," Cabello added, without offering further details on the criminal's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabello said that of the migrants received by Venezuela so far, none were members of Tren de Aragua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela and the United States broke off diplomatic relations in 2019, but had a rapprochement in January to agree on deportation flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  That cooperation was interrupted for a month after Washington cracked down on Venezuela's oil sector, but flights resumed a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday's flight was the third to land since the resumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  In total, 918 people have arrived in Venezuela after being deported from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 553 migrants have returned from Mexico, although it was unclear whether they were originally deported from US soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the United Nations, almost eight million Venezuelans have left their country, fleeing an economic crisis that began to show signs of recovery in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government claims that more than 1.2 million have returned. (AFP)

    Starmer, Trump discuss possible US-UK trade deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Keir Starmer and Donald Trump spoke on Sunday and had "productive" talks towards a UK-US trade deal, the British Prime Minister's Downing Street office said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since Britain's exit from the European Union at the start of the decade, successive UK governments have sought to strike a trade deal with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They discussed the productive negotiations between their respective teams on a UK-US economic prosperity deal, agreeing that these will continue at pace this week," a statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They agreed to stay in touch in the coming days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump himself has dangled the prospect of a "great" deal that could help the United Kingdom avoid, or at least soften, the blow caused by the tariffs the US president has promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike the EU, Britain has declined to retaliate against the tariffs already imposed on the country's steel industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the previous Conservative government did not manage to ink a deal in, Labour party leader Starmer came away from a Washington visit in late February hopeful of reaching an agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK is believed to want a trade deal ahead of Trump's so-called April 2 "Liberation Day", when he is set to unveil a range of tariffs for different trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  But any such accord is yet to see the light of day. (AFP)

    Myanmar quake a top-level emergency, says WHO

<img alt="Rescuers work at the site of a damaged building in Mandalay. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798187_1_20250331084335.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Sunday that the Myanmar earthquake was a top-level emergency as it urgently sought US$8 million to save lives and prevent disease outbreaks over the next 30 days.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said the high numbers of casualties and trauma injuries were at high risk of infection due to limited surgical capacity in the country, while the underlying conditions in Myanmar meant the quake was likely to intensify the risk of disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  "WHO has classified this crisis as a Grade 3 emergency - the highest level of activation under its Emergency Response Framework," the United Nations health agency said in its flash appeal for funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial 7.7-magnitude quake struck near the central Myanmar city of Mandalay on Friday, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake has killed more than 1,700 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in neighbouring Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar, "preliminary assessments indicate high numbers of casualties and trauma-related injuries, with urgent needs for emergency care. Electricity and water supplies remain disrupted, worsening access to health services and heightening risks of waterborne and food-borne disease outbreaks," the WHO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trauma-related injuries - including fractures, open wounds, and crush syndrome - are at high risk of infection and complications due to limited surgical capacity and inadequate infection prevention and control."
  <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said hospitals were overwhelmed, while the scale of deaths, injuries and damage to health facilities "are not yet fully understood".
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said displacement into overcrowded shelters, combined with the destruction of water systems and sanitation infrastructure, had sharply increased the risk of communicable disease outbreaks. (AFP)

    Actor Richard Chamberlain dies aged 90

File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798193_1_20250331091507.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Richard Chamberlain, the Emmy-nominated actor and 1960s heartthrob who rocketed to fame in the TV medical drama "Dr Kildare" and starred in the mini-series "Shogun" and "The Thorn Birds" has died at the age of 90, publicist Harlan Boll said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain died late on Saturday in Hawaii from complications from a stroke, he said in a statement on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain was an instant hit, and became a teen idol, as the handsome Dr James Kildare in the series that ran from 1961-1966. The Guardian newspaper said the then 27-year-old actor "looked like he had been sculpted by a loving god out of butter, honey and grace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The breakout role was the start of a six decade-career that spanned theatre, films and television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain was dubbed the "king of the mini-series" after appearing in several TV dramas in the 1980s and earned plaudits on stage in roles ranging from Professor Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady" and Captain von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" to Shakespeare's Hamlet and Richard II.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also was the original Jason Bourne in the 1988 mini-series "The Bourne Identity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "What's fascinating about Richard is that his range is enormous. His ability to be different each time out is what makes him such a valuable property," producer Susan Baerwald told the New York Times in 1988.
  <br>
  <br>
  The versatile actor was nominated for four Emmys -- as an English navigator in 17th century Japan in "Shogun" (1981), a love-torn priest in "The Thorn Birds" (1983), Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg in "Wallenberg: A Hero's Story" (1985) and for the title role in the 1975 TV movie "The Count of Monte-Cristo."
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of his roles were as romantic leading men, which is why he did not publicly reveal he was a homosexual until he was 68 years old. He feared it would ruin his career. For much of his life he said he pretended to be someone else. "When you grow up in the ’30s, ’40s and ’50s being gay, it's not only ain't easy, it's just impossible,” he told the New York Times in 2014. "I assumed there was something terribly wrong with me. And even becoming famous and all that, it was still there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain said it was a tremendous relief after he acknowledged his sexuality in his 2003 autobiography "Shattered Love: A Memoir."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had no fear left," he said in a 2019 interview. "It was a wonderful experience. People were open, friendly and sweet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born George Richard Chamberlain on March 31, 1934, in Los Angeles, he was the youngest of two sons. He had hoped to be an artist but switched to acting after attending Pomona College in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  His acting career was put on hold when he was drafted into the US Army in 1956 and served in Korea. After his discharge, Chamberlain returned to Los Angeles, where he co-founded a theatre group and had small parts on TV before becoming Dr Kildare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The success of the TV show led to a brief singing career and film roles opposite Julie Christie in "Petulia" (1968) and "The Madwoman of Chaillot" (1969) with Katherine Hepburn. He had a brief run in the musical "Breakfast at Tiffany's" with Mary Tyler Moore. The show closed after four previews.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the late 1960s, Chamberlain moved to England where he honed his acting skills in the BBC series "The Portrait of a Lady" and as Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dr Kildare was a huge hit in England, and I heard that all the London reviewers were coming to rip this interloper to pieces," he said in an interview. "But we got very good reviews."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain returned to the big screen as Lord Byron in the drama "Lady Caroline Lamb" (1972), "The Three Musketeers" (1973) and as a villain in the disaster film "The Towering Inferno" (1974).
  <br>
  <br>
  Throughout his career he mixed roles in Broadway plays, including Tennessee Williams' "The Night of the Iguana," with musicals, TV and films.
  <br>
  <br>
  After coming out publicly, he played both gay and straight characters in TV shows including "Brothers & Sisters," "Will & Grace" and "Desperate Housewives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The actor released a book of haiku poetry in 2012 and narrated Audubon environmental television specials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain lived in Hawaii for many years and had a three-decade relationship with actor and writer Martin Rabbett, his co-star in the 1986 adventure film "Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold." The couple parted in 2010 but remained close friends.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us. How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul," Rabbett said in a statement. (Reuters)

    Trump threatens Iran with bombings and tariffs

<img alt="In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said US and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798156_2_20250331075407.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with bombings and secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said US and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing," Trump said. "But there's a chance that if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's language represented a sharpening of his comment a few days earlier that if Tehran refused to negotiate a new nuclear agreement, "bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran."
  <br>
  <br>
  Western powers accuse Iran of having an clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran says its nuclear programme is wholly for civilian energy purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump in 2018 pulled the United States out of an agreement to relieve sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, in his second term, he has said he is open to talks on a new deal that could reduce the risk of military escalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump revealed in early March that he had sent a letter proposing such talks to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran, deeply suspicious of the US administration after Trump's withdrawal from the original nuclear deal, has refused to negotiate directly with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the official IRNA news agency that he had delivered a letter responding to Trump's outreach to Oman, which has served as an intermediary in the past. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The toll from Myanmar's earthquake continued to rise on Sunday, as foreign rescue teams and aid rushed into the country where hospitals were overwhelmed and some communities scrambled to mount rescue efforts with limited resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar's strongest in a century, struck on Friday, leaving around 1,700 people dead, 3,400 injured and over 300 missing as of Sunday, the military government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, warned that the number of fatalities could go up and his administration faced a challenging situation, state media reported, three days after he made a rare call for international assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  India, China and Thailand are among Myanmar's neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
  <br>
