<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of black-clad mourners vowed support for Hezbollah at the Beirut funeral of slain leader Hassan Nasrallah on Sunday, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nasrallah shared the funeral with his cousin and successor, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb a few days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Saturday, roads into Beirut have been clogged with carloads of supporters travelling in from Hezbollah's other power centres in south and east Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I saw the coffin, reality dawned upon me," said Lara, 26, adding that she had a hard time coming to terms with his killing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pain is great... words cannot describe how I feel," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A founding member of Hezbollah in 1982, Nasrallah won renown around the Arab world in May 2000 when Israel ended its 22-year occupation of south Lebanon following relentless attacks by the group under his leadership.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the decades since, Lebanese have been divided over Hezbollah, with many criticising the group for initiating more recent hostilities with Israel in support of Palestinian militant group Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the funeral began, Israeli warplanes flew at a low altitude over Beirut in what Defence Minister Israel Katz said was a "clear message" to anyone who threatens Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You will specialise in funerals - and we in victories," Katz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address at the ceremony, Nasrallah's successor Naim Qassem said Hezbollah would keep following his "path", and rejected any control by the "tyrant America" over Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resistance is not over, the resistance is still present and ready" to face Israel, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has carried out multiple strikes in Lebanon since a November 27 ceasefire deal with Hezbollah ended more than a year of hostilities, including two months of all-out war. (Agencies)

    Zelensky says progress made on reaching deal with US

<img alt="Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, had earlier declined a US draft agreement on exploitation of his country's valuable minerals. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792870_1_20250224063736.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A contentious Trump administration proposal to give the United States US$500 billion worth of profits from Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for its wartime assistance to Kyiv has been taken off the table, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday, indicating a more equitable deal was in the works.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky had earlier declined a US draft agreement on exploitation of his country's valuable minerals such as lithium used in the aerospace, defence and nuclear industries because it did not contain security guarantees and came with the US$500 billion price tag.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The question of US$500 billion is no longer there,” Zelenskyy told a news conference at a forum of government officials in Kyiv marking the three-year anniversary of Russia’s attack on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian leader said considering aid as a debt to be repaid would be a “Pandora's box” that would set a precedent requiring Kyiv to reimburse all its backers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not recognise the debt," Zelensky said. "It will not be in the final format of the agreement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  No further details were given on the state of negotiations. Ukraine has insisted on security guarantees that it needs to deter any potential Russian aggression in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's engagement with Russian officials and his recent agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow have marked a dramatic about-face in US policy that has rattled leaders in Ukraine and across Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has expressed fear that Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in Ukraine losing territory. US officials have asserted the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine this week when he suggested Kyiv had started the war and Zelensky was acting as a “dictator” by not holding elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the state Tass news agency that Moscow and Washington would continue bilateral talks at the end of next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other top EU officials were headed to Kyiv on Monday for talks with Ukraine’s government.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were to both visit Washington this week as Europe attempts to persuade Trump not to abandon Ukraine in pursuit of a peace deal. (AP)

<img alt="Following the latest hostage release, Israel has so far not returned 620 Palestinian prisoners under its part of the deal. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792869_1_20250224062918.jpg&q=25">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners it had planned to free the day before until militant group Hamas met its conditions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel was waiting to deliver the 620 Palestinian prisoners and detainees "until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies."
  <br>
  <br>
  That was a reference to recent handovers by Hamas that UN officials have said went against international law because they were not respectful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has made hostages appear on stage in front of crowds and sometimes speak before they were handed over. Coffins with hostage remains have also been carried through crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas official Basem Naim, meanwhile, said on Sunday talks with Israel through mediators on further steps in a ceasefire agreement are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being released as agreed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Prisoner's Society, a local group that supports Palestinian prisoners, said Israel is practising "state-terrorism against the prisoners and their families".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ghasan Washahi, whose brother was set to be released on Saturday, said his family was disappointed with the delay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every time there was a list of prisoners set to be released, we would wait, hoping Islam's name would be among them, but it was never there," he said, referring to his brother.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My mother even started losing hope that he would be freed in the deal. And when his name finally appeared, Israel halted the deal." (Reuters)

<img alt="Christian Democratic Union party leader Friedrich Merz speaks at party headquarters. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792868_1_20250224062241.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's conservatives swept to victory in Sunday's elections, with their leader Friedrich Merz set to become the next chancellor, followed by the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in second place after record gains.
 <br>
  <br>
  Merz urged the speedy formation of a new coalition government, warning that as US President Donald Trump was driving rapid and disruptive changes, "the world isn't waiting for us".
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that – after Trump reached out to Russia and made comments fuelling doubts about the future strength of NATO – Europe must boost its defence capabilities and said that he has "no illusions at all about what is coming out of America".
  <br>
  <br>
  The AfD almost doubled its score to over 20 percent, boosted by fears over immigration and security after a spate of deadly attacks blamed on asylum seekers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz's CDU/CSU alliance won more than 28 percent, according to projections at 2000 GMT, crushing the Social Democrats (SPD) of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which were looking at a historic low of 16 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz – a long-time party rival of ex-chancellor Angela Merkel – has vowed a crackdown on irregular immigration. He hopes to win back votes from the AfD whose rise has stunned many in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, the AfD, basking in the vocal support of key Trump allies, is set to stay in opposition. All other parties have vowed to keep it out of power and behind a "firewall" of non-cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But its jubilant leader Alice Weidel hailed the "historic" result and again said her party was ready to govern with the CDU/CSU.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before Merz, 69, takes over, he will have to forge a new coalition government in Europe's top economy, an often drawn-out process he has vowed to complete by Easter. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she held talks with the British and French leaders this weekend and all had pledged "unflinching" support for Ukraine ahead of the third anniversary of its war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We discussed our unflinching support to Ukraine, financially and militarily," Von der Leyen said of her telephone discussions with France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU chief said in a post on the X platform she had "good exchanges" with two key European leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We shared updates on our contacts with US partners and discussed plans for the defence and security of our continent," she said amid growing US-Europe tensions on the Ukraine conflict and funding for Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron and Starmer are both due in Washington this week for talks with US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Downing Street, Starmer and von der Leyen agreed on the importance of offering guarantees for a just and durable peace in Ukraine when they spoke on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  European states are concerned that, in his desire to end the conflict, Trump will offer Moscow favourable conditions without providing Kyiv with security guarantees while keeping European powers away from negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mark the third anniversary of the war, Starmer said in an opinion piece for The Sun on Sunday newspaper that "it is in UK and US interests to stand by Ukraine with security guarantee." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis expressed confidence in his treatment Sunday in a message published in place of his weekly Angelus prayer, as the 88-year-old spent a tenth day in hospital.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am confidently continuing my hospitalisation at the Gemelli Hospital, carrying on with the necessary treatment -- and rest is also part of the therapy!", he said in the message that Vatican sources said was written in the past few days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the Vatican said the pontiff had a "tranquil" night, was alert and had rested after a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 after experiencing difficulty breathing for several days and subsequently had pneumonia diagnosed in both lungs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican described his condition as critical for the first time on Saturday, reporting that the 88-year-old Francis had needed supplemental oxygen and blood transfusions that day after a "prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The night was tranquil, the pope rested," the Vatican said in a one-sentence update on Sunday morning without providing further information. (Agencies)

    Israel deploys tanks in occupied West Bank

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's defence minister on Sunday said the army had "evacuated" three refugee camps in the north of the occupied West Bank and had been ordered to remain there for the coming year "to prevent the return of residents".
 <br>
  <br>
  "So far, 40,000 Palestinians have evacuated from the refugee camps of Jenin, Tulkarm, and Nur Shams, which are now empty of residents," Israel Katz said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have instructed (troops) to prepare for a prolonged presence in the cleared camps for the coming year and to prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks the first time tanks have operated in the Palestinian territory since the end of the second intifada, or uprising, in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hamas accused Israel of placing the Gaza truce in grave danger after the government delayed release of Palestinian prisoners due to be freed after militants released six hostages a day earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the enemy government is doing by postponing the release of our prisoners according to the agreement is behaving like thugs and exposes the entire agreement to grave danger," senior Hamas official Bassem Naim told AFP, calling on the mediators, "especially the United States" to pressure Israel "to implement the agreement as it is and immediately release this batch of prisoners."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yair Golan, the leader of the Democrats in Israel, says his party has been warning that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would torpedo the Gaza ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Netanyahu ordered the delay in the release of the terrorists, openly violating the deal and blowing up Phase A,” he said in a post on X in reference to more than 600 Palestinian prisoners that Israel was obligated to release as part of the deal, including many women and girls taken from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are no real negotiations on Phase B, just spin and the neglect of the hostages’ lives.” (Agencies)

 Germans are voting in a national election on Sunday that is expected to see Friedrich Merz's conservatives regain power and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) score its best ever result as Europe's ailing economic powerhouse lurches rightwards.

  Merz's CDU/CSU bloc has consistently led polls but may not win a majority given Germany's fragmented political landscape, forcing it to sound out coalition partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those negotiations are expected to be tricky after a campaign which exposed sharp divisions over migration and how to deal with the AfD in a country where far-right politics carries a particularly strong stigma due to its Nazi past.
  <br>
  <br>
  That could leave unpopular Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a caretaker role for months, delaying urgently needed policies to revive Europe's largest economy after two consecutive years of contraction and as companies struggle against global rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would also create a leadership vacuum in the heart of Europe even as it deals with a host of challenges, including US President Donald Trump's threats of a trade war and attempts to fast-track a ceasefire deal for Ukraine without European involvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany, which has an export-oriented economy and long relied on the U.S. for its security, is particularly vulnerable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germans are more pessimistic about their living standards now than at any time since the financial crisis in 2008. The percentage who say their situation is improving dropped sharply from 42 percent in 2023 to 27 percent in 2024, according to pollster Gallup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attitudes towards migration have also hardened, a profound shift in German public sentiment since its "Refugees Welcome" culture during Europe's migrant crisis in 2015. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early on Sunday that freeing Palestinian prisoners under the Gaza ceasefire deal will be delayed until Hamas ends "humiliating ceremonies" it holds while handing over Israeli hostages.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In light of Hamas' repeated violations - including the disgraceful ceremonies that dishonour our hostages and the cynical use of hostages for propaganda - it has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday (Saturday) until the release of the next hostages is ensured, without the humiliating ceremonies", Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since a ceasefire came into effect in Gaza on January 19, Hamas has released 25 Israeli hostages in well-rehearsed ceremonies, with masked militants parading the captives on stage and forcing them to wave at Gazans gathered to watch the events, and even address them on a microphone.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the choreographed ceremonies, the hostages are given certificates in Hebrew to mark the end of their captivity before being handed over to Red Cross officials, who then transfer them to Israeli forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, militants even handed over the remains of three hostages in coffins at a ceremony, which drew widespread criticism from the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The parading of bodies in the manner seen this morning is abhorrent and cruel, and flies in the face of international law," said UN human rights chief Volker Turk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has dismissed repeated calls by the Red Cross to release the hostages in private.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Hamas released six Israeli hostages as part of the scheduled seventh such hostage-prisoner swap under the fragile first phase of the ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, Israel was to release more than 600 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  But soon after the hostages were released, Israeli sources said that Netanyahu was expected to decide on the Palestinian prisoners' releases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Sunday, Netanyahu announced his decision to suspend the release of Palestinian prisoners until the ceremonies for handing over hostages are halted. (AFP)

<img alt="In his statement, British Foreign Minister David Lammy reiterated UK's military backing and its pledge to be " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792796_1_20250223081441.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London will unveil a significant package of sanctions against Russia on Monday, which marks three years since the start of its war with Ukraine, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is also the time to turn the screws on (Vladimir) Putin's Russia," Lammy said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow, I plan to announce the largest package of sanctions against Russia since the early days of the war - eroding their military machine and reducing revenues fuelling the fires of destruction in Ukraine," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK's decision to ramp up sanctions comes as US President Donald Trump has in recent weeks sought to sideline Kyiv and its European backers from talks with Russia on the future of the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a critical moment in the history of Ukraine, Britain and all of Europe... Now is the time for Europe to double down on our support for Ukraine," said Lammy.
  <br>
  <br>
  London has already imposed sanctions on 1,900 people and organisations with link's to Putin's government since the start of the war, as of January 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its sanctions target the Russian financial, aviation, military and energy sectors, including through bank asset freezes, travel bans, and trade restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU countries last week agreed a new round of sanctions which includes a ban on imports of Russian aluminium set to be formally adopted on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his statement, Lammy reiterated UK's military backing, which includes a pledge to provide US$3.78 billion annually to Kyiv and "being ready and willing to provide UK troops as part of peacekeeping forces if necessary". (AFP)

    Trump revels in mass firings before adoring crowd

<img alt="President Trump addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) annual meeting in National Harbor, Maryland. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792795_1_20250223075752.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that “nobody's ever seen anything" like his administration's sweeping effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of government, congratulating himself for “dominating” Washington and sending bureaucrats “packing.”
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference just outside Washington, Trump promised, “We’re going to forge a new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for generations to come.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The president argues that voters gave him a mandate to overhaul government while cracking down on the US-Mexico border and extending tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump clicked easily back into campaign mode during his hour-plus speech, predicting that the GOP will continue to win and defy history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has empowered Elon Musk to help carry out the firings, and the billionaire suggested Saturday that more might be coming.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A short time later, an “HR” email was sent to federal workers across numerous agencies titled “What did you do last week” and asking that recipients “reply with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.” It cautioned against sending classified information, and gave a deadline of just before midnight on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said during the speech that he'd carry out harsher immigration policies. But those efforts have so far largely been overshadowed by his administration's mass federal firings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also devoted large chunks of his address reliving last year's presidential race, jeering at former President Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris - his Election Day opponent - gleefully proclaiming, “I haven’t said that name in a while.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had kinder words for President Xi Jinping , saying “I happen to like” him. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 One person died, and two police officers were seriously injured on Saturday in a knife attack in eastern France that President Emmanuel Macron said was an "Islamist terror act."
 <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said three more officers were lightly wounded in the attack in the city of Mulhouse, carried out by a 37-year-old suspect who is on a terror prevention watchlist, prosecutor Nicolas Heitz told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect was in custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's national anti-terror prosecutors unit (PNAT), which has taken charge of the investigation, said the suspect first attacked the municipal police officers, shouting "Allahu Akbar" (God is greatest).
  <br>
  <br>
  A civilian passerby who intervened was fatally injured, the PNAT said in a statement. According to Mulhouse prosecutors, he was a 69-year-old Portuguese national.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron said there was "no doubt" that the incident was "a terrorist act," specifically "an Islamist terrorist act."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government was determined to continue doing "everything to eradicate terrorism on our soil," Macron added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police established a security perimeter after the attack that happened shortly before 4:00 pm (2300 HKT) during a demonstration in support of the Democratic Republic of Congo in a busy part of Mulhouse, a city of around 110,000 inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to union sources, the suspect was born in Algeria and has been under judicial supervision and house arrest, with an expulsion order from France. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lasting peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved through a two-state solution, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a phone call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, returning from the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, reaffirmed China's support for Arab positions on Palestine and opposition to forced displacement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang stressed the importance of a ceasefire and future governance that respects Palestinian autonomy, highlighting the urgency of reconstruction efforts in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign minister stated that Gaza is a Palestinian territory, and any future arrangement must respect the will of the Palestinian people, adhering to the principle of "Palestinians governing Palestine" in post-conflict governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised the urgent need to develop reconstruction and governance plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Abdelatty provided an update on Egypt's efforts to implement the ceasefire and coordinate a reconstruction plan with other Arab nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reiterated Egypt's stance against forced displacement of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China plays a key role, Abdelatty said, adding that Arab countries hoped for China's support in restoring peace and rebuilding Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministers also discussed Sudan and Syria. (Xinhua)

    Hamas releases six more Israeli hostages

<img alt="As on previous occasions the hostages were paraded on stage before being handed over to the Red Cross. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792777_1_20250222214137.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas paraded five Israeli hostages, some looking dazed and others elated, before cheering crowds at two meticulously choreographed ceremonies in the Gaza Strip on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the first well-rehearsed morning ceremony in Rafah, Hamas fighters stood in an orderly fashion as they handed over hostages Tal Shoham and Avera Mengistu, who walked with apparent difficulty, to the Red Cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  As in previous hostage releases, the men were given certificates in Hebrew to mark the end of their captivity before being helped into vehicles from the Red Cross, which acts as an intermediary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters from the group's armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, wearing fatigues, balaclavas and green headbands, formed a cordon around the area to hold back the crowd of onlookers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a similarly choreographed ceremony later in Nuseirat, hostages Eliya Cohen, Omer Shem Tov and Omer Wenkret took the stage with shaved heads, smiling at a cheering crowd of hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio stood briefly on stage alongside Hamas fighters, waving at the crowd while a camera drone and a photographer captured the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shem Tuv, who was abducted on October 7 from the Nova music festival in southern Israel, waved and blew kisses to the crowd before kissing two of his Hamas captors on their keffiyeh-wrapped heads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said later it had received a sixth Israeli hostage, Hisham al-Sayed, who was captured in Gaza a decade ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  At both ceremonies, the Palestinian militants put on a display of strength.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Rafah, some held Kalashnikov assault rifles and others flaunted hand-held rocket launchers, while Hamas's green flag flew around the square on buildings destroyed by war in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fidaa Awda, a resident of the southern city who attended the ceremony said: "We say and continue to say that we are with the resistance, we are with the valiant Brigades, we are with the fighters."
  <br>
  <br>
  On stage in southern Gaza, in front of a table draped in camouflage cloth, US-made assault rifles reportedly seized from Israeli soldiers in combat were displayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Behind the table, a slogan in Arabic, English and Hebrew read: "We are the flood. We are the extreme strength."
  <br>
  <br>
  The slogan referenced Operation Al-Aqsa flood, the name used by Hamas and its allied Palestinian factions for their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other banners depicted fallen Hamas military commanders, including former armed wing chief Muhammad Deif, killed in an Israeli air strike in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  A poster below the stage read "And the red freedom has a door, struck by every bloodied hand."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentence is a verse from a 1926 anti-colonial poem by Egyptian poet Ahmad Shawqi which slain Hamas leader and October 7 mastermind Yahya Sinwar was seen reciting in a video taken during the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some in the crowd of hundreds stood on large chunks of concrete from nearby buildings demolished by bombs, others on the upper floors of buildings whose walls appeared damaged by the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man held a young boy clad in military fatigues and a Hamas headband as militants in arms paraded on the back of pickup trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Hamas praised the hostage releases and said that the Israeli public had two options.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Either they receive their prisoners in coffins, as happened on Thursday, due to Netanyahu's arrogance, or they embrace their prisoners alive in commitment to the (Palestinian) resistance's conditions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixty-two hostages taken during Hamas's October 7 attack are still being held in Gaza, including 35 who the Israeli military says are dead. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Syrian man arrested after a stabbing attack at Berlin's Holocaust memorial that wounded a Spanish man had been harbouring a "plan to kill Jews," police and prosecutors said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 19-year-old arrested on Friday with blood stains on his hands was carrying a copy of the Koran and a prayer rug, and initial investigations suggested "connections with the Middle East conflict," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attacker approached the 30-year-old Spanish man from behind at around 6:00 pm (1700 GMT) on Friday and stabbed him in the neck with a knife, according to the investigators.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault took place at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, a sombre grid of concrete steles located near the Brandenburg Gate and the US embassy in Berlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victim suffered life-threatening injuries to his neck and had to be placed in an artificial coma but was no longer in critical condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Syrian suspect came to Germany in 2023 as an unaccompanied minor, police said. He was granted asylum and lived in the eastern city of Leipzig, according to the investigators.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no evidence of links to other people or groups and the suspect had not previously come to the attention of the police in Berlin, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault happened two days before a general election after a campaign centred heavily on immigration after a series of deadly stabbing and car-ramming attacks blamed on migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six people who witnessed the knife attack on Friday received counselling from rescue services at the scene, where bloodied clothes were left on the ground.

  Germany has grown increasingly alarmed about rising anti-Jewish sentiment and violence since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. (AFP)

 Pope Francis will miss the Angelus prayer on Sunday for the second straight week as the 88-year-old is treated in hospital for pneumonia, the Vatican said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The text will only be published, not read out, as it was last weekend, the Vatican press office said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 with bronchitis, but it turned into pneumonia in both lungs, causing widespread alarm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff's doctors had told a press conference on Friday there was no imminent risk to his life but that he was "not out of danger."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican's early morning update on Saturday said simply: "Pope Francis rested well." (AFP)

    New remains returned by Hamas are of Shiri Bibas

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Bibas family announced on Saturday that remains returned to Israel the day before were identified to be of hostage Shiri Bibas, taken captive by Palestinian militants in October 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli kibbutz community of Nir Oz had earlier on Saturday announced Bibas's death, after the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had transferred more human remains to Israeli authorities without saying whose they were.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the identification process at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, this morning we received the news we feared the most. Our Shiri was murdered in captivity and has now returned home to her sons, husband, sister, and all her family to rest," the Bibas family said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite our fears for their fate, we kept hoping we would get to hug them again, and now we are broken and grieving.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 16 months, we sought certainty, and now that we have it, there is no comfort in it, but we hope for the beginning of a closure," the family said in a statement on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Hamas handed over four bodies, saying they were of Shiri Bibas, her two young sons, and an elderly hostage.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the remains of her two sons and the elderly hostage were identified positively, Israeli authorities said the fourth body was not that of Shiri Bibas, sparking anger and grief across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Friday, Hamas – which blamed a possible "mix-up" of bodies – handed over new remains to the Red Cross, which now have been identified to be that of Shiri Bibas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has long maintained an Israeli air strike killed Bibas and her boys – Kfir and Ariel – early in the war.
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump fired top US military officer General Charles "CQ" Brown on Friday, as part of a major shake-up of the armed forces' leadership.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump offered no explanation for Brown's dismissal less than two years into his four-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which followed sweeping layoffs of federal workers and moves to dismantle government institutions just a month into the president's second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown had been nominated to the top military role by Democratic president Joe Biden and became only the second Black person to hold the position.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following Trump's announcement on Brown, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he was seeking a replacement for Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to serve as the top US Navy officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump thanked Brown for "his over 40 years of service to our country" in a post on his Truth Social platform, describing him as "a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision sets off a period of upheaval at the Pentagon, which is already bracing for firings of civilian staff, a dramatic overhaul of its budget and a shift in U.S. military deployments under Trump's new America First foreign policy. (Agencies)

    Scholz hits back at US over Ukraine, free speech

<img alt="Chancellor Olaf Scholz on stage at the SPD's election campaign finale in the Westfalenhallen, Germany. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792716_1_20250222072303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday stressed his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and defended Germany's commitment to free speech in a push-back against recent broadsides from the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  As US President Donald Trump has reached out to Russia, feuded with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky and threatened to sideline Europe, Scholz said that "Germany and Europe must stick to their own positions".
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at his last major campaign event before Sunday's elections, Scholz pledged that "we won't leave Ukraine alone and decide things over their heads and we will ensure that Ukraine is a country that can choose its own government".
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany has been Kyiv's second-biggest supplier of military aid after the United States since Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz also pushed back at accusations from Trump's inner circle, including tech billionaire Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance who called Germany's policies against online hate crime "Orwellian".
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has strongly supported the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and, on the day of Trump's inauguration, performed a right-arm gesture that some interpreted as a Nazi salute, a charge he has firmly rejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have nothing against people becoming billionaires but becoming a billionaire because you want the right to insult people and break the law is not acceptable," Scholz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We in Europe will stick to our rules, for example that Nazi symbols are banned in Germany."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Zelensky said after a flurry of phone calls with leaders of allied countries that Europe must do "much more" to bring about peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  After speaking to the leaders of countries including Germany and Poland on Friday, Zelensky said in his televised evening address that "Europe must and can do much more to ensure that peace is actually achieved" in Ukraine. (AFP)

<img alt='The California-based multinational tech giant said it was "gravely disappointed" over the cessation of end-to-end encryption services. Photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792699_1_20250222025738.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple said on Friday it could no longer offer full end-to-end encryption for British customers and iPhone users, following US media reports the UK government had asked for global data access.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users, and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  ADP means only account holders can view content such as photos and documents stored online and in the cloud through what is known as end-to-end encryption.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Washington Post reported earlier this month that the UK had demanded that Apple create a "back door" to enable the government to view any information uploaded by any Apple user around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many tech platforms pride themselves on their ability to guarantee privacy through encrypted messaging channels, and providing access to law enforcement has long been seen as off-limits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services, and we never will," Apple said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The California-based multinational tech giant added it was "gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy.".
  <br>
  <br>
  Police officials worldwide say encryption can protect criminals, terrorists, and pornographers even when authorities have a legal warrant for an investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But civil rights and privacy advocates, along with cybersecurity professionals, advocate encrypting data to protect against wrongful snooping by authorities as well as hackers. (AFP)

 South Africa on Friday concluded the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting, after a range of global issues having been discussed.
 <br>
  <br>
  South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola hailed the event as "historic" when briefing the media after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the final day of the summit, Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated China's support  of the free trade system with the World Trade Organization (WTO), and called on the G20 countries to work together to build a just world of common development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Wang met his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, on the sidelines of the gathering.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang recalled the successful meeting between President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kazan, Russia last year, which set the general direction for the improvement and development of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, the two sides agreed that China and India, as two ancient civilisations and neighbouring countries, should trust and support each other and help each other succeed. (Reuters/Xinhua)

    US Senate passes slimmed-down budget blueprint

<img alt='Donald Trump is still calling for the "big beautiful" bill that includes tax credits and other flagship measures, to be passed. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792688_1_20250221224727.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate passed a budget blueprint early on Friday that steamrolled past Democratic opposition, moving one step closer to unlocking the funds the Trump administration wants for border security and other priorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The slimmed-down framework – which lacks Trump's support, as it does not include tax cuts he wants to extend – was adopted after an all-night "vote-a-rama" voting session on multiple amendments brought forward by Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pressure is now on the House of Representatives, whose Republican leaders insist they want to pass their own budget text – "one big beautiful bill," as Trump terms it, including tax cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  If they fail to reach an agreement in the short term, however, they could fall back on the narrower budget framework adopted in the Senate on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The resolution passed overnight would allow the budget to pass through the Senate with just a simple majority, instead of needing 60 votes. Republicans control the chamber, but with only 53 votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any budget would still need to pass through the House, where Republicans also hold a narrow majority – before becoming law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senate Republicans are pushing to pass the slimmed-down budget to help Trump score early political victories on issues such as migration, which has long topped his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their version would push other initiatives such as extending his tax credits – which Trump implemented in his first term, and which expire at the end of the year – down the road several months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican leadership in the House of Representatives prefer the "big beautiful" bill that includes the tax credits and other flagship measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strategy is not without risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Massive federal programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid, providing health insurance for millions of Americans, could be targeted by staunch conservatives in the House as they seek to offset the cost of extending Trump's tax credits.
  <br>
  <br>
  But slashing those programmes could prove wildly unpopular. With only a slim majority in the House, Republicans risk seeing their text rejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump thanked Senate Republicans in a post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday for working to fund his border programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he did not backtrack on his earlier comments calling for the larger House budget framework to pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to 'kickstart' the Reconciliation process, and move all of our priorities to the concept of, 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL,'" he wrote in a Truth Social post on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier He Lifeng expressed concerns over US tariffs and trade restrictions on China during a video call with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides had an in-depth exchange of views on important issues in China-US economic relations, and both parties agreed to keep communicating on matters of mutual concern, according to a readout released by CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He, the top trade negotiator on the Chinese side, and Bessent recognised the importance of bilateral economic and trade relations, the readout added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's call came as Beijing and Washington seek to manage their relationship as the world's two largest economies stand on the precipice of a renewed trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump said earlier this week he expected President Xi Jinping to visit the US, without giving a timeline for his trip.

 Pope Francis spent another night without incident, the Vatican said on Friday, marking a week in the hospital for the 88-year-old pontiff suffering from pneumonia in both lungs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The night went well, this morning Pope Francis got up and had breakfast," the Vatican said in a regular morning update.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest in a series of incrementally positive updates in recent days from the Vatican, which has regularly been publishing information -- however modest -- about the Argentine pope's state of health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital last Friday with bronchitis, but it later developed into pneumonia in both lungs, sparking widespread alarm.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Vatican said Thursday he continued to not have a fever and his "hemodynamic (blood flow) parameters continue to be stable".
  <br>
  <br>
  Vatican sources have said the pope continues to keep up with his correspondence and has been working with his collaborators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, the head of Italy's bishops conference, expressed confidence on Thursday that the pope was "on the right path".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that the pope had breakfast, read the newspapers, received people, means that we are on the right path to a full recovery, which we hope will happen soon," Zuppi said. (AFP)

    Israel slams Hamas for not returning body of hostage

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas on Friday of committing a "cruel and evil" violation of the Gaza ceasefire deal by failing to return the body of hostage Shiri Bibas.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will act with determination to bring Shiri home, along with all of our captives - both the living and the fallen - and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement," Netanyahu said in a video statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas on Thursday handed over bodies it said were of four hostages, including three members of the Bibas family - Shiri Bibas and her two young sons - along with an elderly captive.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the identities of the Bibas boys and the elderly hostage were confirmed by Israeli forensic experts, the fourth body was not that of Shiri Bibas, according to Israeli officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said it was, in fact, that of a Gazan woman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cruelty of the Hamas monsters knows no bounds," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two boys - Kfir and Ariel - had become symbols of the hostage crisis along with their mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  During their attack on October 7, 2023, that triggered the Gaza war, Hamas filmed and later broadcast footage showing the Bibas family's abduction from their home near the Gaza border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ariel was then aged four, while Kfir was the youngest hostage at just nine months old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their father, who was also seized during the attack, was released earlier this month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his G20 counterparts on Thursday that a "window for peace" is opening for the Ukraine crisis, days after top US and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top diplomat made the remarks at the G20 ministerial meeting in South Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has noted that calls for peace talks have been rising recently, and a window for peace is opening," Wang said, according to a readout of his speech at the G20 meeting in South Africa published by the Foreign Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  At talks in Riyadh on Tuesday, Russia and the United States agreed to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war that began when Russia sent its military into Ukraine on February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  China supports all efforts to achieve peace, including this "recent consensus" reached between the United States and Russia, Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that all parties involved can find a sustainable and lasting solution that addresses each other's concerns," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the gathering in Johannesburg, Wang held meetings with his counterparts from multiple countries including Turkey and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  A curtain-raiser to the G20 summit in November, the meeting was attended by top diplomats, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, his Indian counterpart, as well as European envoys like France's Jean-Noel Barrot and Britain's David Lammy. (Agencies)

    Macron to tell Trump to not be 'weak with Putin'

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that France was entering a "new era" three years after the Russian-Ukrainian war and that he planned to tell US President Donald Trump that he could not "be weak" with Vladimir Putin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Macron also defended Volodymyr Zelensky, the embattled leader of Ukraine, speaking ahead of a planned visit to the White House to meet Trump next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron has sought to coordinate a European response to Washington's policy shift in US-Russia relations, hosting this week two emergency meetings with leaders of EU and non-EU nations, including Germany, Britain, Canada, and Norway.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he wanted the French to grasp the magnitude of the threat coming from the Kremlin, calling Russia "an existential threat to Europeans."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Q&A session on social media on Thursday, Macron, 47, declared that France was embarking on a "new era."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are entering an era in which each of us must ask what we can do for the French nation and the Republic," Macron said after discussing Ukraine with party leaders earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has sent shock waves around Europe by saying he is ready to resume diplomacy with Putin to end Russia's war against Ukraine, over the heads of European countries and Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump will meet in Washington with Macron on Monday and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday next week, the White House said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going to tell him, 'You can't be weak with President Putin. That's not who you are, it's not your trademark, it's not in your interest," Macron said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Kremlin said that any British plan to send troops to Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping mission would be unacceptable for Russia and that it was monitoring statements by Starmer with concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said this week that Moscow views as a "direct threat" the idea of having Nato member troops on the ground in Ukraine, even if they operate there under a different flag. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, to discuss China-Russia relations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, highlighted the strengthening strategic partnership between the two countries, noting significant progress in cooperation and mutual interest, particularly in global multi-polarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is willing to work with Russia to fully implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state and to further advance China-Russia relations in the new year, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lavrov expressed Russia's desire to deepen cooperation in trade, economy, and culture with China and advance their shared goals with Brics, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the United Nations, the G20, and other frameworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the Ukrainian crisis, Wang reiterated China's consistent stance, emphasising the country's role in promoting peace and political resolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lavrov, for his part, said Russia's focus on addressing the root causes of the crisis and its commitment to a fair and sustainable peace in line with the United Nations Charter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides also exchanged views and coordinated positions on other international and regional issues, including the situation in the Middle East. (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's High Court has found former soccer federation boss Luis Rubiales guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent and fined him over 10,000 euros (US$10,434), the court said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It acquitted him of charges of coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence for Rubiales, 47, in a case that caused heated debate in Spain about sexism in women's football and wider Spanish society.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said in a statement it had also acquitted Rubiales' three co-defendants who were accused of attempting to coerce Hermoso into saying the kiss, at the 2023 World Cup awards ceremony in Sydney, was consensual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ensuing furore overshadowed Spain's victory in the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales has maintained through this month's trial that Hermoso had consented to be kissed amid the celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling also banned Rubiales from going within a 200-metre radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fine was set at 20 euros a day over an 18-month period. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two women died in a knife attack on Thursday at a shopping center in the Czech Republic, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they detained a teenage suspect in connection with the stabbings in a store in the city of Hradec Kralove, some 100 kilometres east of Prague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports initially said the victims had been injured, one of them seriously, but police later said both had died.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were not identified.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 16-year-old Czech national was detained by police about one kilometer from the scene, shortly after the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  A knife was found nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Petr Fiala offered his condolences to the relatives of the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What has happened in Hradec Kralove today is an absolutely incomprehensible and horrible act,” he posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motive for the attack was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the situation was under control and there was no danger to the public. (AP)

<img alt="Ousted premier Han Duck-soo told Seoul's Constitutional Court he had " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792501_1_20250220184003.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's ousted premier said on Thursday that he had opposed suspended President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law, testifying for the first time at his former boss' impeachment trial about the events of a night that threw the country into turmoil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han Duck-soo was impeached by parliament as acting President and Prime Minister in December over alleged obstruction of the trial that would formally remove Yoon from office for his martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, he appeared before that trial for the first time, telling Seoul's Constitutional Court he had "expressed my opposition" to Yoon's decision to suspend civilian rule on the night of December 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said he and most of his fellow cabinet members "believed such a declaration would put South Korea in serious difficulty", and that he recalled them "being concerned and trying to dissuade it".
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's hearing was Yoon's 10th before Seoul's Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the hearings wrap up, the judges will go behind closed doors to deliberate Yoon's fate — with elections required in 60 days if he is removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon walked out of the court just five minutes after proceedings began on Thursday, according to a pool report.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyer Yoon Kap-keun told reporters that the ousted president felt it was "inappropriate" for him to sit in the same court room with Han "or for the president to watch the prime minister testify".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not good for the nation's prestige," his lawyer quoted Yoon as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon later returned to hear the testimony of former senior intelligence official Hong Jang-won, seen as a key figure in the decision to declare martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong has claimed to be in possession of a memo containing a list of names of individuals Yoon ordered arrested during the night of the martial law declaration, including the leaders of the opposition and Yoon's own ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will do my best to recount everything as I remember it," Hong told reporters before the hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of South Korea's National Police Agency, who is also on trial on insurrection charges related to the martial law decree, is another witness. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Thursday released the bodies of four Israeli hostages, said to include a mother and her two children who had long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation's agony following the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel which triggered the Gaza war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remains were said to be of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kfir, who was 9 months old when he was taken, was the youngest captive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The militants displayed four black coffins on a stage in the Gaza Strip surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a vampire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fighters then carried the coffins over to Red Cross vehicles, where staffers in red vests covered them in white sheets before placing them inside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Cross convoy headed back to Israel, where authorities will carry out the formal identification of the remains using DNA, expected to take up to two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only then will the families be given the final notification. The Israeli military confirmed it had received the coffins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people, including large numbers of masked and armed fighters from Hamas and other factions, gathered at the handover site on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expects President Xi Jinping to visit the United States, without giving a timeline for his trip.
 <br>
  <br>
  In remarks made to reporters on Air Force One, Trump also said "it's possible" for the two countries to have a new trade deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2020, the US had already agreed to "a great trade deal with China" and a new deal is possible, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A conversation or interaction between Xi and Trump is seen as crucial to a potential easing or delay of trade tariffs after the US imposed a 10 percent tariff on goods from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi last travelled to the US in November 2023, in his fifth visit to the country as president for a summit with then US president Joe Biden, resulting in agreements to resume military-to-military communications and curb fentanyl production.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll have, ultimately, President Xi, we will have everybody coming," Trump said while also speaking about others leaders visiting the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he was talking to China about TikTok as the US seeks to broker a sale of the popular app owned by Chinese parent firm ByteDance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders had spoken just before Trump took office on January 20 and discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan. Trump said last week he had spoken to Xi since taking office as well, but did not offer details on the topics of that conversation. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar on Thursday handed over the first batch of hundreds of Chinese scam centre workers who are set to be repatriated through Thailand in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of foreigners are expected to be freed and returned from scam compounds in Myanmar in the coming weeks, starting with 600 Chinese over the next three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The compounds run by criminal gangs are staffed by foreigners, many of whom say they were trafficked and forced to work running internet scams swindling people around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of those involved are Chinese and Beijing has stepped up pressure on Myanmar and Thailand to shut the centres down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Karen Border Guard Force, a militia allied with the Myanmar junta, has said it is preparing to deport 10,000 people linked to the compounds in areas it controls on the border with Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two double-decker coaches delivered a first round of returning workers to the border post in the western Thai town of Mae Sot on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First group of 50 Chinese have crossed to Thailand and headed to the airport. There will be three more batches (today), each with 50 Chinese," a local border task force official has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has put on 16 flights over the next three days to ferry 600 of its nationals home direcly from Mae Sot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The release follows several visits by Public Security Assistant Minister Liu Zhongyi to Bangkok and the border in recent weeks to arrange the repatriation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scam centres have proliferated across Southeast Asia in recent years, including in Cambodia and the Philippines, as the value of the industry has boomed to billions of US dollars a year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US airline Delta on Wednesday said it will offer US$30,000, or HK$233,395, to each passenger on a plane that crashed as it landed at Toronto airport this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This gesture has no strings attached and does not affect rights" of passengers, a company spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a Delta Air Lines plane that departed from the US city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, hit the runway hard at Toronto's main airport and flipped upside down.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fireball and thick plumes of black smoke engulfed the plane as it skidded to a halt on its roof but none of the 80 people on board were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delta said 21 passengers were injured in the accident but only one was still hospitalised as of Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paramedic services said emergency responders dealt with various injuries among the passengers, including back sprains, head injuries, anxiety and headaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic footage of the crash posted on social media on Tuesday showed the Bombardier CRJ-900 coming in to land before slamming into the runway, then sliding forward in a roll, with its wings sheared off before it stopped on its back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation, assisted by the US Federal Aviation Administration, Delta and Mitsubishi, which purchased the CRJ line of planes from Bombardier in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Toronto crash was the latest in a recent string of air incidents in North America, including a midair collision between a US Army helicopter and a passenger jet in Washington that killed 67 people, and a medical transport plane crash in Philadelphia that left seven dead. (AFP)

    Trump brands Zelensky a 'dictator' in bitter clash

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump called Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky a "dictator" on Wednesday, widening a personal rift with major implications for efforts to end the conflict triggered by Russia's military offensive three years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States has provided essential funding and arms to Ukraine, but Trump made an abrupt policy shift by opening talks with Moscow just weeks after he returned to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to have a country left," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was elected in 2019 for a five-year term and has remained leader under martial law imposed as his country fights for its survival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump savaged Zelensky, saying "he refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing (Joe) Biden 'like a fiddle.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's popularity has fallen, but the percentage of Ukrainians who trust him has never dipped below 50 percent since the conflict started, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Biden, the United States had lauded Zelensky as a hero and hammered Moscow with sanctions as Ukraine battled against advancing Russian soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump held a press conference on Tuesday in which he tore into the Ukrainian leader and repeated Kremlin narratives such as the claim that Ukraine started the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's invective drew shock from Europe where German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was "wrong and dangerous" to call Zelensky a dictator.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington, Trump's former vice president Mike Pence also issued a stinging rebuke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives," Pence wrote on X. (AFP)

    'Constructive' talks after China blasts tariffs at WTO

<img alt="The US, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the WTO discussions. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792389_2_20250220104914.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Wednesday that discussions on trade tensions were "constructive", after China accused the US of imposing "tariff shocks" that could upend the global trading system.
 <br>
  <br>
  China condemned tariffs launched or threatened by US President Donald Trump at a World Trade Organization meeting on Tuesday. Washington dismissed China's comments as hypocritical.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has announced sweeping 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory tariffs and to file a WTO dispute against Washington in what could be an early test of Trump's stance towards the institution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the six countries that participated in the talks on trade turbulence, put on the agenda by China, raised concern about mounting tensions, but also called for restraint, said WTO spokesperson Ismaila Dieng in a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the discussions, which were part of broader talks on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The large majority "stressed the importance of upholding WTO principles and values and called for action to preserve the stability and effectiveness of the global trading system", Dieng added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time that mounting trade frictions have been formally addressed on the agenda of the watchdog's top decision-making body, the General Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao expressed strong dissatisfaction with US tariffs on Chinese goods in a letter addressed to the newly confirmed US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the US to unilaterally impose tariffs undermined normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US", Wang said in the letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said Beijing was willing to work with Washington to "strengthen dialogue, manage differences, promote cooperation" and hoped to create a "fair and predictable policy environment" for the two countries' business communities to cooperate. (Reuters)

    Dead or alive: Mosquito bounty in Manila

<img alt="Enthusiasm is high among residents who carried pails, cups and other containers filled with dengue-spreading mosquitoes to exchange for cash. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792349_1_20250219211745.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Residents in a central Manila neighbourhood lined up on Wednesday, as dengue cases spike nationwide, to collect a bounty – one peso for every five mosquitoes, dead or alive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carlito Cernal, village captain in Addition Hills, said the awareness-raising project he initiated could have a "huge impact" on curbing the tropical disease's spread when combined with local clean-up efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine health officials and experts were less convinced, but enthusiasm was high among residents who carried pails, cups and other containers filled with dengue-spreading mosquitoes to exchange for cash at the village hall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iluminado Candasua brought three live specimens in a sealed plastic cup that were duly counted and transferred by village officials to their so-called death chamber, a glass-enclosed UV light machine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very hard to capture mosquitoes," Candasua said, explaining how he strategically chose a darkly lit fire station where he used a cup to manually trap the insects against a wall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Candasua said the peso he got for his efforts, worth little more than a US penny, would go into a piggy bank he's using to save for a cellphone for his child.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization ranked the Philippines as the country most affected by dengue in the Western Pacific region in 2023 when it had 167,355 cases and 575 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tropical disease, while rarely fatal, carries symptoms ranging from fever and headaches to swollen glands.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country has seen an "unusual rise" in cases this year, with 28,200 patients recorded as of February 1, according to Department of Health spokesman Dr Albert Domingo, a 40 percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five cities and municipalities have declared outbreaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Domingo said on Wednesday it was important that local communities consult with health authorities before launching ad hoc efforts, adding that the problem was best addressed by "going back to the fundamentals".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sooner we clean our surroundings and overturn any possible areas where stagnant water is collecting, then we will have a better fight against dengue," he said, urging residents to protect themselves with insect repellent and long sleeves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Public health expert Anthony Leachon said that while he welcomed all anti-dengue initiatives, the Addition Hills roundup would have "little or no impact at all".
  <br>
  <br>
  Some residents, he warned, might even exacerbate the problem by cultivating mosquitoes for coins.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Rachel Estoque did not intentionally breed mosquitoes, the haul she turned in on Wednesday came from a source of stagnant water in her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 45-year-old housewife said she woke up early to catch mosquito larvae growing in water in her flower pot. The 20 larvae earned her four pesos, enough for a tiny packet of cooking oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  But like others waiting to trade in their catch, Estoque said the money was less important than the principle involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My child suffered from dengue before and I know how scary and difficult that is... that's why I'm participating in this project," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis's heart is holding up very well despite his pneumonia, a Vatican source said on Wednesday, amid growing concerns over the hospitalised 88-year-old's condition.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff was admitted to a Rome hospital with bronchitis last week after suffering breathing difficulties, but the Holy See revealed on Tuesday evening that he had developed pneumonia in both of his lungs.

  "The pope spent a peaceful night, woke up and had breakfast," the Vatican said on Wednesday after Francis's fifth night at the Gemelli hospital, which has a suite reserved especially for popes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope is breathing on his own. His heart is holding up very well," a source in the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis has been speaking to friends by telephone, has been out of bed and sitting in a chair, and working on and off, the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, the Vatican had reported that Francis was in "good spirits."
  <br>
  <br>
  But in an evening medical bulletin, it warned that "the laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the Holy Father's clinical condition continue to present a complex picture."
  <br>
  <br>
  A "polymicrobial infection" which has come on top of "bronchiectasis and asthmatic bronchitis, and which required the use of cortisone antibiotic therapy, makes therapeutic treatment more complex," the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The follow-up chest CT scan which the Holy Father underwent this afternoon... demonstrated the onset of bilateral pneumonia, which required additional drug therapy," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff had part of his right lung cut away when he was 21, after developing pleurisy that almost killed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican has cancelled a papal audience on Saturday and said the pope would not attend mass on Sunday, although it has yet to announce plans for his weekly Angelus prayer, which is held on Sunday at midday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump expanded his offensive against trading partners on Tuesday, threatening 25 percent tariffs on imported cars, and similar or higher duties on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has announced a broad range of levies on some of the biggest US trading partners since taking office in January, arguing that they will help tackle unfair practices – and in some cases using the threats to influence policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He recently pledged 10 percent duties on all goods coming from China, and 25 on steel and aluminium imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  At his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, he told reporters that tariffs on the automobile industry will "be in the neighbourhood of 25 percent," with specifics to come around April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about threatened tariffs on pharmaceuticals and chips, Trump said: "It'll be 25 percent and higher, and it'll go very substantially higher over (the) course of a year."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he wanted to give affected companies time to bring their operations to the United States, saying that he had been contacted by major firms that "want to come back."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also said that Washington's trading partners could avoid being taxed by investing in factories in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to give them time to come in," he said. "When they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff. So we want to give them a little bit of a chance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have warned it is often Americans who end up paying the cost of tariffs on imports, rather than foreign exporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of the cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's special envoy was in Kyiv on Wednesday, saying he was there to "listen" to Kyiv's concerns, a day after the US president tore into his Ukrainian counterpart in a surprise press conference.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on Tuesday, after Russian and US officials met in Saudi Arabia for their first high-level talks in over three years without Ukraine taking part, Trump appeared to blame Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for having "started" the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today I heard, 'oh, well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal," Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky had chided the US-Russia talks for not including Kyiv, saying efforts to end the war must be "fair and involve European countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv by train on Wednesday morning on what he said was a mission to "sit and listen" to Kyiv's concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand the need for security guarantees... Part of my mission is to sit and listen and say: what are your concerns?" Kellogg said in a video posted by Ukraine's Suspilne news outlet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia and the United States agreed on Tuesday to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv and its European allies have become alarmed at being cut out of the process with Russia to end the conflict. (AFP)

    Rapper A$AP Rocky found not guilty in assault trial

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Musician A$AP Rocky was found not guilty of two counts of felony assault at the conclusion of a trial in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The musician, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, has two children with the singer Rihanna. He would've faced more than two decades in prison if he had been convicted of the alleged attack on a former friend in Hollywood in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the weeks-long trial, prosecutors said Mayers had shot a nine-millimetre semi-automatic weapon during a confrontation with Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli, on November 6, 2021, in the heart of Hollywood, grazing Ephron's hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mayers, 36, had insisted he had been carrying only a harmless prop gun.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles courtroom, full of fans of the hip-hop performer and his singing superstar partner, exploded into screaming glee as Rocky and Rihanna embraced and sobbed at the not guilty verdict from jurors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank y’all for saving my life," he told the jurors as they left the Los Angeles courtroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rihanna cried and hugged the defence lawyers, as did Rocky.
  <br>
  <br>
  She attended the trial sporadically and brought the couple’s two sons – two-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and one-year-old Riot Rose Mayers – for some of the closing arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The verdict came at the height of Rocky’s fame, if not the pinnacle of his music career.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-time Grammy nominee, fashion mogul and actor has a banner year in the works, and can now look to it without the threat of prison hanging over him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is scheduled to headline the Rolling Loud music festival in March; he is one of the celebrity co-chairs of fashion’s biggest night, the Met Gala, in May; and he stars with Denzel Washington in director Spike Lee’s film “Highest 2 Lowest,” set for release in early summer. (Agencies)

<img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed his nation's exclusion from the Riyadh gathering. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792190_1_20250219035354.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia and the United States agreed on Tuesday to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war in Ukraine after talks that drew a strong rebuke from Kyiv over its exclusion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington noted European nations would have to have a seat at the negotiating table "at some point", following the first high-level official Washington-Moscow talks since the 2022 war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some European leaders, alarmed by President Donald Trump's overhaul of US policy on Russia, fear Washington will make serious concessions to Moscow and re-write the continent's security arrangement in a Cold War-style deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed his nation's exclusion from the Riyadh gathering, which lasted for more than four hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that any talks aimed at ending the war should be "fair" and involve European countries, including Turkey - which offered to host negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will only be feeding Putin's appetite," a Ukrainian senior official requesting anonymity said, referring to the launch of talks without Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov agreed to "appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible", the State Department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington added the sides had also agreed to "establish a consultation mechanism" to address "irritants" to Russia and America's relationship, noting the sides would lay the groundwork for future cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuri Ushakov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide, confirmed the negotiating teams' appointment but said it was "difficult" to discuss a date for a potential Trump-Putin meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump brushed aside Ukraine's concern about being left out of the meeting and suggested he could meet President Putin shortly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was now more confident of a deal to end the Ukraine war after the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting marks a major diplomatic coup for Moscow, which had been isolated for three years under the previous US administration of president Joe Biden. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk is not an official employee of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and has "no formal authority to make government decisions," according to a White House court filing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man is widely seen as the de-facto head of Doge, created by President Donald Trump, which has sought to drastically reduce US government spending including with thousands of job cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had announced in November that "the Great Elon Musk... will lead the Department of Government Efficiency ('DOGE')."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the filing on Monday by Joshua Fisher, director of the Office of Administration, Musk "is an employee of the White House... as a non-career Special Government Employee" and a "Senior Advisor to the President."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like other senior White House advisors, Mr Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself. Mr Musk can only advise the President and communicate the President's directives," Fisher said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US Doge Service is a component of the Executive Office of the President. The US Doge Service Temporary Organisation is within the US Doge Service. Both are separate from the White House Office," he said in the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Musk is an employee of the White House Office. He is not an employee of the US Doge Service or US Doge Service Temporary Organisation. Mr Musk is not the Temporary Administrator," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fisher's filing was made in a case brought against Musk by 14 US states, including New Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint interview with Musk due to be broadcast on Fox News later on Tuesday, Trump took aim at critics saying that the Tesla founder was the one running the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think nobody in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me... But you know what I have learned Elon? That people are smart, they get it," Trump said in an excerpt of the interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk added: "Yeah they do actually." (AFP)

 An extraordinary Arab League meeting on Gaza, initially set for next week, has been postponed to March 4, host Egypt said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian foreign ministry said the new date was agreed with Arab League members as part of "substantive and logistical preparations" for the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting was called in response to US President Donald Trump's proposal to take over the war-battered Gaza Strip and move its Palestinian inhabitants elsewhere, including to Egypt and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia is set to host the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Friday to present their own plan for Gaza's reconstruction while ensuring that Palestinians remain on their land.

  Trump's Gaza plan has sparked outcry across the Arab world, prompting a rare show of unity among Arab nations to block it. (AFP)

  US President Donald Trump is pushing for a swift resolution to the three-year conflict in Ukraine.

  The meeting marks another pivotal step by the Trump administration to reverse Washington's policy on isolating Russia and is meant to pave the way for a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier this month upended US policy toward Ukraine and Russia by saying he and Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian officials aren’t taking part in the meeting, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday his country wouldn't accept the outcome if Kyiv didn't take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio was accompanied by US national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, while Lavrov sat next to the Kremlin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan and national security adviser Musaed al Alban joined Rubio, Lavrov and others for the start of the meeting but were expected to leave early in the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ushakov said on Monday the talks would be “purely bilateral” and would not include Ukrainian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks mark a significant expansion of US-Russian contacts nearly three years into a war that has seen ties fall to the lowest level in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lavrov and then-US Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked briefly on the sidelines of a G-20 meeting in India nearly two years ago, and in the fall of 2022, US and Russian spymasters met in Turkey amid Washington’s concerns that Moscow could resort to nuclear weapons amid battlefield setbacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recent US diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that will not be favourable to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the UK on Monday to decide how to respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Trump and Zelensky following the meeting. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Protesters against US President Donald Trump and his policies braved frigid temperatures in parts of  America on Monday, shouting “No kings on Presidents Day” in East Coast cities and attempting to enter the Arizona Statehouse to oppose a bill that would bolster fast-changing federal immigration enforcement.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Florida and California, local media outlets reported on hundreds of protesters carrying out “Not my Presidents Day” protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The “No Kings" theme was orchestrated by the 50501 Movement, and marked the second set of protests criss-crossing the nation in less than two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar nationwide event on February 5 drew participants in dozens of cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sets of rallies denounced Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk, the leader of Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, an outside-government organisation designed to slash federal spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 1,000 people marched in the snow from the Statehouse in Boston to City Hall, chanting “Elon Musk has got to go” and other slogans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The temperature was below freezing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston protesters, some dressed in Revolutionary War-style clothing, carried signs saying such things as “This is a Coup” and “Cowards Bow to Trump, Patriots Stand Up.” One sign had a depiction of Uncle Sam saying “I Want You to Resist.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thought it was important to be here on Presidents Day to demonstrate for what America stands for,” said Emily Manning, 55, a Boston engineer who came to the rally with her two teenage sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  “American values are not the values of the plutocracy or the limited few rich people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers of Monday’s protests, which were focused on state capitals and major cities including Washington, DC; Orlando, Florida; and Seattle, said they were targeting “anti-democratic and illegal actions of the Trump administration and its plutocratic allies.”
  <br>
  <br>
  One sign at the rally that attracted hundreds in the nation's capital said, “Deport Musk Dethrone Trump.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The rallies followed a series of Trump executive orders and came just days after layoffs across federal agencies as part of an effort to reduce the government workforce. (AP)

    Argentina's president denies role in 'cryptogate' scam

<img alt="Authorities are investigating Argentina's President Javier Milei for his promotion of a cryptocurrency which crashed within hours of its launch last week. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792070_1_20250218105528.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentine President Javier Milei on Monday denied promoting a cryptocurrency that crashed last week, losing investors billions of dollars and prompting a flood of complaints, as prosecutors reportedly prepare an investigation into the scandal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I did not promote it, I spread it," Milei told broadcaster TN, adding that it "is a problem between private parties because the State does not play a role here."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I acted in good faith," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina's federal prosecutor's office will examine whether Milei engaged in fraud or criminal association or was in breach of his duties when he praised the $LIBRA cryptocurrency on social media Friday evening, according to news reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The currency's value soared then crashed, and Milei deleted his blessing hours later, saying he had made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentine economists, crypto specialists and opposition political figures criticised the self-declared "anarcho-capitalist" president, an economist by training, and said the digital asset could be a fraud or a Ponzi scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry observers said the operation was likely a "rug pull" -- a scam where developers unveil a crypto token, attract investors, then quickly cash out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights NGO Observatory for the Right to the City, one of several complainants, alleges Milei formed part of a "criminal organisation that organised a fraud with the $LIBRA cryptocurrency that simultaneously affected more than 40,000 people with losses of more than US$4 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kobeissi Letter, a publication that provides analysis on global capital markets, said on X Friday that within minutes of its launch, "multiple large holders began liquidating MILLIONS of USD worth of $LIBRA."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This included gains of +US$4 million or more as $LIBRA rose to US$4.6 billion in market (capitalisation)," it reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Milei said he had "nothing to hide" from an investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that those who carried out the transactions, including "a lot of bots," were people who "knew very well what the risk was."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, former president and opposition figure Cristina Kirchner called Milei a "crypto-scammer" and opposition parliamentarians announced they would institute impeachment proceedings against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any such proceedings would be highly unlikely to succeed, however, as they would require a two-thirds majority in the lower house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other parties are seeking the creation of a special parliamentary commission to question Milei. (AFP)

    Plane flips upside down in Toronto crash, 18 injured

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Delta Air Lines jet with 80 people onboard crash-landed on Monday at Toronto's main airport, officials said, flipping upside down and leaving at least 18 people injured but causing no deaths.
 <br>
  <br>
  Endeavor Air Flight 4819 with 76 passengers and four crew was landing in the afternoon in Canada's largest metropolis, having flown from Minneapolis in the US state of Minnesota, the airline said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No explanation of the cause of the accident, or how the plane ended up flipped with its wings clipped, has been provided.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very early on. It's really important that we do not speculate. What we can say is the runway was dry and there were no crosswind conditions," said Todd Aitken, the airport's fire chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  He confirmed that 18 people had been injured in the accident, with no fatalities.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the wounded, including those with minor injuries, were taken to area hospitals either by ambulance or helicopter, said the paramedic services' Lawrence Saindon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic images on local broadcasts and shared on social media showed people stumbling away from the upside down CRJ-900 plane, shielding their faces from strong gusts of wind and blowing snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire crews appeared to douse the aircraft with water as smoke wafted from the fuselage and as passengers were still exiting the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's North America correspondent Simon Marks said it had been snowing at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The images in which through the snow that was enveloping the airport, you could just make out the visual of a CRJ-900 regional jet that had crash at the airport and somehow ended up…literally upside down on the runway."
  <br>
  <br>
  Toronto airport authority chief executive Deborah Flint told a news conference the incident did not involve any other planes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency crews were "heroic" in their response, she said, "reaching the site within minutes and quickly evacuating the passengers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them "have already been reunited with their friends and their families," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airport suspended all flights after the incident, before resuming them at around 5:00pm EST, more than two hours later. It said passengers should expect long delays.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Europe's security is at a turning point, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday, as she arrived in Paris for an emergency meeting to address Washington's shock policy shift on the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Europe's security is at a turning point. Yes, it is about Ukraine - but it is also about us. We need an urgency mindset. We need a surge in defence. And we need both of them now," she said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leaders from key European powers gathered in France to strategise after US President Donald Trump blindsided allies by launching efforts with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris talks come as Washington said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff would on Tuesday meet with a Russian delegation including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Riyadh ahead of a future meeting between Trump and Putin in the Saudi capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Council chief Antonio Costa, who was also participating, said the meeting was "the beginning of a process, that will continue with the involvement of all the partners committed to peace and security in Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The European Union and its Member States will play a central role in this process," he wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe is scrambling to come up with plans to ensure any peace deal in Ukraine is lasting, with Britain saying it would be willing to deploy peacekeepers if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris meeting was to bring together the heads of government of Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain, as well as the heads of the European Council, the European Commission and Nato. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese AI app DeepSeek will not be available to download in South Korea pending a review of its handling of user data, authorities in Seoul said Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek's R1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders with its ability to match the functions of its Western competitors at a fraction of the cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of countries have questioned DeepSeek's storage of user data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission said DeepSeek would no longer be available for download until a review of its personal data collection practices was carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has "acknowledged that considerations for domestic privacy laws were somewhat lacking", the data protection agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It assessed that bringing the app into line with local privacy laws "would inevitably take a significant amount of time", the agency added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To prevent further concerns from spreading, the commission recommended that DeepSeek temporarily suspend its service while making the necessary improvements," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has "accepted" that proposal, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration and experimentation that could lead to faster breakthroughs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the firm has unveiled large language models challenging the dominate tools developing by its US rivals, but at a lower cost. (AFP & agencies)

<img alt="Singapore's Workers' Party Chief Pritam Singh walks outside the State Courts in Singapore. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791965_1_20250217140348.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Singapore's opposition leader was fined on Monday for lying to parliament while helping a fellow party member cover up a false witness account, but narrowly avoided being barred from contesting upcoming national elections.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pritam Singh, 48, secretary-general of the Workers' Party, was found guilty on two counts of lying to a parliamentary committee probing a fellow MP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conviction comes as the Southeast Asian nation's political opposition seeks to challenge the dominance of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) in elections expected within months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PAP has ruled Singapore since 1959.
  <br>
  <br>
  District court judge Luke Tan said that contrary to what he told the committee, Singh had not done enough to get rookie MP Raeesah Khan to admit to her lie in parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge also gave credence to Khan's testimony that Singh had told her during a meeting to "take the lie to the grave."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh told reporters outside court that based on "advice I have and that I've been given, I will be running for the general elections."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have been advised that the law is quite clear," he said, adding he understood the elections department would release a statement later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not going to be an easy election... we'll have to fight hard, and that's what we will do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh, who said he would appeal the court's decision, was fined Sg$7,000 for each charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The path of choosing opposition politics is not for the faint hearted," Singh said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the constitution, a person fined a minimum of Sg$10,000 (US$7,400) or jailed for at least one year, is disqualified from running for election or holding a parliamentary seat for five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will not be disqualified as the threshold of $10,000 fine per charge is not crossed. You can't stack up the fines," Eugene Tan, who teaches constitutional law at Singapore Management University, told reporters. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ready to send UK troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force as he tried to show the US that European nations should have a role in the talks on ending the conflict.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said he had not taken the decision to consider putting British servicemen and women "in harm's way" lightly, but securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter further aggression.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday said Ukraine and Europe would be part of any "real negotiations" to end Moscow's war, signalling that US talks with Russia this week were a chance to see how serious Putin is about peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  The end of Russia's war with Ukraine "when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again," Starmer wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer's comments were the first time he has explicitly said he is considering deploying British peacekeepers to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has previously said that Britain was willing to help play a part in any peace deal that is negotiated.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Starmer said he was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by "putting our own troops on the ground if necessary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do not say that lightly," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer is expected to join German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other European leaders in Paris on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron convened talks on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump stunned European allies in Nato and Ukraine last week when he announced he had held a call with Putin without consulting them and would start a peace process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, then suggested Ukraine and other European leaders would have no place at peace negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and Russian officials are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to start talks aimed at ending Russia's nearly three-year war in Ukraine. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Papal thriller "Conclave" and immigrant epic "The Brutalist" on Sunday tied for top honours at Britain's Bafta awards with each film picking up four coveted gongs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Conclave", directed by German-born Edward Berger, won the Bafta for the best film with its tale of the intrigue and horse-trading behind the scenes during the election of a new pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accepting the award, Berger recalled the journey to make the film took seven years, paying tribute to British screenplay writer Peter Straughan's "wonderful script" and lead actor Ralph Fiennes.
  <br>
  <br>
  US filmmaker Brady Corbet took the Bafta for best director for "The Brutalist", while leading man Adrien Brody scooped up the best actor gong for his portrayal of a Hungarian Holocaust survivor and architect who emigrates to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brody told a winners press conference that the film was "an opportunity for me to honour my own ancestral struggles".
  <br>
  <br>
  In "a film that speaks to tremendous cruelty and despicable behaviour in our past... we see elements existing today that can guide us and remind us of that," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran British actor Fiennes, who played a cardinal in "Conclave", once again saw his hopes of winning a Bafta gong dashed, losing out to Brody in the race for the honour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scandal-hit "Emilia Perez", a surreal musical about a Mexican druglord who transitions to a woman, had been heavily favoured at the beginning of the year. But it ended the evening with just two Baftas, including one for Zoe Saldana for best supporting actress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until last month, French director Jacques Audiard's movie had been expected to be a frontrunner having won 11 nominations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But old racist and Islamophobic tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascon surfaced at the end of January, shaking up the race just before the London ceremony and the Oscars on March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  A surprise of the night was the Bafta for best actress which went to 25-year-old Mikey Madison for her portrayal of a sex worker in the black comedy "Anora" about an erotic dancer's whirlwind romance gone wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madison, who beat out frontrunner Demi Moore, told reporters she wanted to dedicate the award to "the sex worker community, I see you, you deserve respect and human dignity". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 India's capital New Delhi was jolted awake on Monday by powerful tremors from a magnitude 4.0 earthquake, with its epicentre on the edge of the sprawling megacity an hour before dawn.
 <br>
  <br>
  There were no immediate reports of major damage, but terrified residents rushed outside as buildings shook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Survey said the quake struck at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to follow "safety precautions" and stay alert to "possible aftershocks".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tremors were felt in Delhi and nearby areas. Urging everyone to stay calm and follow safety precautions, staying alert for possible aftershocks. Authorities are keeping a close watch on the situation," Modi said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police issued an emergency number to call for help, saying: "We hope you all are safe, Delhi."
  <br>
  <br>
  Northern India lies on a major geological faultline where the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence. (AFP)

    Asian American women in the spotlight at US awards

<img alt="Honourees of the Outstanding Asian American Women Who Dared gala say the event comes at a crucial time, as US President Donald Trump aggressively moves to stamp out diversity, equity and inclusiveness. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791931_1_20250217101545.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A special event in the United States has been shining a spotlight on the achievements of Asian American women, in areas ranging from academics to sports.
 <br>
  <br>
  The awards gala for the Outstanding Asian American Women Who Dared – held in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley on February 13 – recognised 12 people, who said the event comes at a crucial time, especially with US President Donald Trump aggressively moving to stamp out traces of diversity, equity and inclusiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re entering a very special era in history, and it just makes us have to really step in and step up and work harder,” honouree Liu Xin – the founder of the Enlight Foundation, which focuses on education equality and helping youth engage in developing climate solutions – said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A presenter at the show, Fiona Ma, is the first Asian American Woman to be elected treasurer of California.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s been very difficult for me being an Asian woman moving up the ranks and politics. And, you know, tonight is about recognising other trailblazers and people who are really making a mark.”
  <br>
  <br>
  And one of those making a mark is Sue Xu, the managing partner of venture capital firm Amino Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has contributed to the success of at least 45 companies with a total value of more than US$100 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has also addressed the United Nations about the role of artificial intelligence in combatting human trafficking and promoting the welfare of women.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel like, woman's voice hasn’t been heard. Especially nowadays, when you're talking about DeepSeek, talking about AI. And then I feel like a lot of times woman is victims of AI. And then, you know, South Korea, they just passed that out, criminalising possession for, you know, deep-fake pornography. I feel like as a woman, if we lead with responsibility, we have a chance,” Xu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While many of the honourees stem from the world of business and technology, artists were celebrated too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honouree Chen Jiebing is one of the foremost erhu virtuosos in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai native has been nominated for a Grammy and recently had the honour of Nasa using her music to celebrate its 60th anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want the world to see and hear the unique vocal expressions of this instrument and it’s versatility to incorporate with other Western styles of music such as jazz, and even American Blue Grass country style music.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like all the honourees, Chen has daring goals. Hers is to someday elevate the erhu to be as widely recognised worldwide as the violin.

    Trump expects to meet Putin 'very soon'

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he could meet "very soon" with Vladimir Putin, adding he believes his Russian counterpart genuinely wants to stop fighting in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No time set, but it could be very soon," Trump told reporters, hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to play down expectations of upcoming high-level talks in Riyadh on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Rubio set to lead a high-level American delegation at the discussions with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia's capital in the coming days, a flurry of diplomacy was taking place as the Ukraine war nears its third anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, addressing reporters after a flight on Air Force One, said his team had been speaking "long and hard" with Russian officials, including his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff whom the president said met with Putin for about three hours recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he wants to stop fighting," Trump said of Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he believes Putin wants to seize the entirety of Ukraine, Trump said: "That was my question to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If he's going to go on... that would have caused me a big problem," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he wants to end it, and they want to end it fast. Both of them," he said, adding "Zelensky wants to end it too."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile said Sunday he believed Russia was preparing to "wage war" against a weakened NATO should Trump dilute US support for the alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump appeared to dismiss Zelensky's remarks, telling reporters he was "not even a little bit" concerned about the Ukrainian leader's messaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio is set to lead a high-level US team to Riyadh, but it remains unclear whether there will be any Ukrainian participation. Rubio said he wasn't even sure who Moscow was sending. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a united front on Sunday against their common enemies, threatening to "open the gates of hell" on Hamas and "finish the job" against Iran.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pledges came during a joint address to reporters in Jerusalem, where Rubio began his first Middle East trip as Secretary of State in President Donald Trump's new administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas cannot continue as a military or a government force... they must be eliminated," Rubio said of the Palestinian Islamist group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comment came a day after Hamas freed three Israeli hostages in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners, the sixth such swap under the ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of ceasefire violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding to strain on the deal, Trump has made a widely-condemned proposal to take control of Gaza and relocate its more than two million residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanking Rubio for "unequivocal backing" for Israel's policy in Gaza, Netanyahu added that Israel and the United States are determined to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions and its "aggression" in the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel and America stand shoulder to shoulder in countering the threat of Iran," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agreed that the ayatollahs must not have nuclear weapons and also agreed that Iran's aggression in the region must be rolled back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli-Iranian enmity stretches back decades through a history of clandestine wars and attacks by land, sea, air and cyberspace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran says it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes. (Agencies)
